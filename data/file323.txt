3230000 some would say with marxist momma in the top job its little wonder why barack obama is the dncs golden boy coming to denver with mainstream media garnered rock star status
3230001 is leading the democratic partys new mission to make religious believers particular ardent christian believers view the party and its candidates as receptive to and often impelled by the dictates of faith
3230002 daughtrys mission directed from within democratic headquarters in washington and the convention offices in denver is essential to transforming the partys reputation so e terri lavelle an evangelical who said within a few minutes of our sitting down to talk on the last saturday in february 1973 i accepted the lord jesus christ as my savior has traveled to evangelical events around the country seeking to strike up relationships with leaders like the megachurch pastors rick warren and joel hunter and hoping that at the very least the partys new attention and respect its desire to listen and engaged with evangelical issues including abortion is recognized
3230003 god allows us to choose in the biggest matter whether to accept him in our lives how then can we take away choice on other profound issues
3230004 she didnt put any distance between herself and the book a black theology of liberation
3230005 at the basis of black liberation theology is the understanding that god has a special place in his heart for those at the bottom of the ladder
3230006 mommy can you go away again for a long time and ill go stay with grandma
3230007 you cant bring pikes back but this can hold those responsible accountable for their actions
3230008 if theres any culpability here its on winnfield for not properly training police officers
3230009 we obviously have limited resources in this campaign as compared to barack obama so we have to spend in the most effective way
3230010 we found that form of advertising where you are getting people who are already looking for something is a very cost effective way of getting those people to our site and getting them to do the things we want them to do
3230011 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president
3230012 no on the job training needed to be commander in chief
3230013 what must we believe about that president what does he think where has he been has he walked the walk
3230014 thats a lot more savvy than weve seen from them in a lot of other things
3230015 all of the candidates should be advertising on gas prices right now
3230016 if you google to try and figure out where the lowest prices for gas are in town then you should see an ad for barack obama on how hes going to break the grip of foreign oil you have to go after people where they are you cant just expect they are going to come to you you have to think ok what is the public searching for right now
3230017 barack obama is a christian get the facts at his official site
3230018 in the u k i have noticed there have been a couple of crises which have affected brands and they have been quite quick to use google adwords as a way to counteract that crisis or counteract rumors
3230019 in my experience issue words dont necessarily yield strong results like the candidates names do
3230020 if a campaigns goal for their search campaign is conversions they may decide to yield the top spot on the issues and ensure they can devote the funds to the candidates name
3230021 early in the cycle campaigns were interested in gathering e mail addresses and raising money from the base
3230022 in this stage you are seeing more of an effort at persuasion
3230023 you are not looking for that active voter who maybe knows who he or she is voting for
3230024 you are looking for that more passive voter who is reading information but not quite ready to commit

3230049 childbirth is still viewed as a pathological rather than a natural life event hospitals are geared towards the small proportion of about 5 per cent of women whose pregnancies are seriously complicated as midwives have become more technically skilled with electronic equipment many have found it difficult to develop confidence in giving truly woman centred care some never get the chance to learn how to do this

3230051 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it

3230053 our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
3230054 i think i can get back and be competitive at the top level i have enjoyed it
3230055 i didnt feel old i didnt feel stiff i felt just as i did in the past it was really good
3230056 it feels like i have never been away from the sport at the start of the cross country yesterday i felt just as nervous at the start as i always did and i then had the same buzz at the end
3230057 i went to the athens olympics as a trainer but i didnt enjoy it it was all work and no fun

3230072 hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3230073 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3230074 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3230075 its big for us to hopefully keep on a good run here because were far from out of it right now
3230076 thats the team attitude we want to keep winning ballgames and make it interesting
3230077 we played like youd like to see about 95 games a year
3230078 we pitched well we hit the ball in key situations and we played some good defense
3230079 hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3230080 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3230081 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3230082 i had heard about that as soon as i stepped into this position
3230083 then i heard about d h conley being in the state championship so it was a little overwhelming but i think we will be all right
3230084 that is the only focus i give them one game at a time
3230085 they are already helping out the jv players and the younger players on varsity
3230086 the seniors have really stepped up to the call with me being a new coach they have helped me
3230087 she is probably going to be our standout player this year
3230088 i am looking for great things from her she is strong ive seen a couple tapes from last year and she looks about 10 times stronger than she did last year
3230089 we should make it at least as far as we did last year
3230090 i am looking forward to working with them they are a very good group of girls and the talent is very good
3230091 i am expecting my juniors to step up right now our communication is our big thing we are working on that as a group
3230092 i didnt really want to go to carolina or state and walk on i feel like i will have a better chance to step up my game at coastal and make an impact
3230093 she showed up at one of my tournaments all the way in virginia
3230094 she then watched me play in every tournament over the summer she is pretty much the main reason i feel like she can help me take my game to the next level she has the potential to help me and has shown a lot of interest in me
3230095 before i committed when there were coaches out there i would get so nervous
3230096 so yeah i think it took off a little bit of pressure
3230097 when i had to qualify that was the first round that i really shot in the 60s
3230098 i had seven birdies i kind of take it three holes at a time if i have a bad hole i just see how low i can go in the next three holes it is like i am starting over every three holes
3230099 you get your own name on you locker it is pretty high up there you get a lot of stuff when you register it was pretty big
3230100 if i would have putted better i wouldnt have had any problem making the cut
3230101 i think this is pretty much as competitive as it is going to get for me until i get to college it is pretty intense there is not a whole lot of talking going on during rounds
3230102 i think we have a really good chance of winning state because we have caroline and her game has improved tremendously
3230103 we are real excited about this year about the chance of winning state

3230114 unlike the intravenous drug application of oxycyte in traumatic brain injury this would be a topical application applied to the skin or to the surface of wounds so we re hopeful that the clinical review process would be as a medical device which can be shorter and faster than review as a drug
3230115 if the safety efficacy cycle is indeed shorter as i believe it can be then it suggests that substantive partnering models could be launched shortly after safety and efficacy are proven
3230116 while i m excited about this new potential use for oxycyte i know that the big question on our shareholders minds right now is the status of our phase iib protocol for oxycyte in tbi we re not going to get into the details of our communications with the fda that would not be in the best interests of the company or the process i ll just say that positive communications are continuing and that when there is news we ll announce it

3230119 welche erbanlagen es allerdings genau sind ist aber noch nicht bekannt
3230120 wir arbeiten in dem verbundprojekt daran die risikofaktoren besser zu erkennen und festzustellen welche faktoren chronische entz ndungen von zahnfleisch oder kiefer f rdern
3230121 das sollte unter anderem zu effektiveren therapien und zu neuen m glichkeiten der diagnostik f hren
3230122 mathematiker der universit t bonn werden am rechner simulieren wie sich bestimmte risikofaktoren etwa eine hohe mechanische kaubelastung auf den verlauf der erkrankung auswirken
3230123 so galt parodontose bis mitte des vergangenen jahrhunderts als ganz normale alterserscheinung erst sp ter erkannte man dass der zahnverlust durch chronische entz ndungen hervorgerufen wird die sich durchaus bek mpfen lassen
3230124 der zahnarzt kann zumindest das problem erkennen und weiterf hrende schritte einleiten

3230136 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3230137 based solely on their generalised knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3230138 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3230139 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3230140 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting

3230201 el sue o de la gente es acelerar la construcci n de un pa s moderno conseguir el renacimiento de la naci n y buscar con todos los pueblos del mundo el progreso pac fico la coexistencia amigable y el desarrollo armonioso

3230206 estos juegos me hacen sentirme orgulloso de tener sangre china en las venas
3230207 me tuvieron dos meses a prueba para comprobar si iba a vivir de los recuerdos
3230208 la gran suerte que tiene un entrenador que ejerza en china es la cultura del esfuerzo y el trabajo en que se educa a la gente
3230209 me llamaron a trav s de la federaci n internacional me tuvieron dos meses a prueba m s que nada para comprobar que no iba a vivir de los recuerdos de glorias pasadas y que iba a entregarme a fondo en cuanto pas ese tiempo me aceptaron como si fuera uno de ellos con su ya conocida hospitalidad de matr cula de honor
3230210 sino porque la cocina de espa a es una de las mejores del mundo pero su tipo de comida es ideal para los deportistas el gran cambio respecto a lo que toman los deportistas espa oles es que aqu cambian la pasta por el arroz

3230212 el equipo es muy bueno pero le falta experiencia las m s veteranas tienen 21 a os cuando la media de edad de nuestras rivales se sit a entre 25 y 30 a os

3230214 subiendo con mi menor corpulencia ofrecer menor resistencia al aire y bajando con el viento a favor podr meter el mismo desarrollo que los especialistas y como es un descenso de dar pedales me sacar n menos diferencia que con el viento en contra

3230230 yo me he agotado para conseguir esta marca ellos peirsol vyatchanin y grevers est n acostumbrados a nadar en estos tiempos tienen el culo pelado
3230231 ha estado saliendo mejor en los entrenamientos pero dice que en este poyete no se encuentra a gusto vamos a practicar para ver si se puede ara ar algo
3230232 me ha gustado mucho el control del primer 50 porque l puede salir mucho m s r pido
3230233 pero hemos estado entrenando mucho la segunda parte de la prueba que es donde ha conseguido recortar un segundo
3230234 lo que est pasando en la nataci n es ins lito
3230235 antes de la aparici n del ba ador lz racer de speedo calculamos que para entrar en la final habr a que hacer 53 95s hizo falta hacer un m ximo de 53 7s impresionante en atenas la medalla de oro se gan con 54 04s
3230236 durante la formaci n de aschwin hemos trabajado mucho la base aer bica no puedes ni competir bien ni entrenar bien si no tienes esta base pero lleg un momento en que empez a dejar de asimilar bien este trabajo porque sus cualidades gen ticas est n en la velocidad este a o hemos cambiado de forma progresiva hacia el 100 hacia el rendimiento anaer bico esto lo ha asimilado muy bien y tiene mucho margen de mejora
3230237 tiene clase y talento es capaz de hacer de todo
3230238 nadar por la ma ana y contra phelps es muy duro
3230239 he dormido poco por los nervios y la emoci n que eso significa s que puedo ir m s r pido de lo que he ido esos nervios tienen un poco que ver con nadar en la calle de al lado de phelps por su presencia tiendes a volar y morir yo vol en los primeros 150 metros y me empec a morir en los siguientes intentar no morir en la final
3230240 s c mo nada tras la ltima pared y el ltimo viraje se queda bajo el agua durante much simo tiempo le gusta intentar hacerlo durante unos buenos metros ah por debajo del agua va r pido rapid simo de repente sale a la superficie y te sorprende todo el mundo conoce sus t cticas el problema es igualarlas yo bajo la cabeza e intento nadar todo lo r pido que puedo
3230241 que no s si phelps ha sido tan fuerte como se supone
3230242 hemos cre do hasta el final hoy hemos perdido por unas pocas cent simas ma ana ganaremos por unos pocos segundos la vida no se para por esto hay que tener precauci n con las emociones la experiencia ha jugado un papel es una pena
3230243 pens que ten a una buena oportunidad para clasificarme porque nadaba a su lado
3230244 es destructiva tambi n tiene clase y talento por eso con una preparaci n dura es capaz de hacer de todo
3230245 pido a la deportista que colabore y nos diga qui n est detr s
3230246 inhabilitaremos o encarcelaremos al inductor a quienes se lucran con esto
3230247 me temo que la abandonen cuando es otra v ctima del sistema
3230248 lamentamos el hecho que se debe a la irresponsabilidad de una deportista y que no empa a el trabajo del equipo ol mpico espa ol desgraciadamente antes de los juegos m s de 20 deportistas de varios pa ses de rusia de grecia de bulgaria de francia de italia han dado positivo tambi n
3230249 pedir a la federaci n que abra una investigaci n cuando el contraan lisis confirme el positivo queremos saber qui n le proporcion la epo qui n se la aconsej qui n se la suministr aplicaremos la ley penal antidopaje con la m xima dureza y lograremos inhabilitar o encarcelar al inductor a quienes se lucran con la salud de los deportistas y a la deportista le pido que d un paso adelante que reconozca su error p blicamente que salga del c rculo vicioso que colabore y nos diga qui n est detr s la ayudaremos quiz s su carrera deportiva est acabada pero no su carrera humana
3230250 me recuerda mucho al chava jim nez en triste y a pantani
3230251 temo que todos la abandonen que la dejen sola que la consideren la villana la deportista que ha arruinado la alegr a de los juegos o como ha dicho blanco que ha manchado la imagen del deporte espa ol cuando en el fondo no es m s que otra v ctima del sistema
3230252 y maribel moreno pas seis en los ltimos seis meses tres en el ltimo mes el ltimo el 18 de julio
3230253 y tres de ellos han sido fuera de competici n
3230254 s pueden ser fuera de competici n pero eso no significa que sean controles por sorpresa que son los que funcionan como el que esperaba a moreno nada m s aterrizar en pek n
3230255 la nica funci n de los controles preol mpicos es asegurarse de que los deportistas llegan a los juegos con los calzoncillos limpios para evitarse disgustos como el de moreno no de luchar contra el dopaje
3230256 el consejo avisa a los deportistas de que tal d a en la concentraci n o en una carrera en la que participen deber n pasar el control preol mpico todos saben que el d a en que queden en madrid para tomar el avi n se les tomar n muestras de sangre que se enviar n al laboratorio de montoro en valencia para que las pasen por el sysmex y saber si sus valores sangu neos est n en regla

3230260 the difficult part is getting him to reach his potential
3230261 leron can be one of the top five fullbacks in the nfl if he applies himself to his job and to the team
3230262 i really want to be called just a back because i can do a lot more than just blocking
3230263 if i can get him on the first play then hes going to be in for a long game
3230264 i felt bad because i should have came in shape
3230265 hes still not there but hes done a heck of a job
3230266 i dont know if ive seen a guy get in shape as quickly as he has
3230267 leron likes a lot of things he likes to eat he likes to talk on the telephone he likes to sleep and he likes to be lazy
3230268 hes got a gift for gab and hes going to tell you what he thinks is right
3230269 but the bottom line is he listens to what im saying hes been a pleasure to coach and has been one of my bright spots
3230270 it was great that they didnt lose confidence in me
3230271 you said we might be able to help each other out what makes you think i need your help
3230272 i think there might be scandal in your house and i hope that together we can discover who is behind it and do something about it before it becomes too widespread
3230273 er well maybe but that is the sort of thing is more of ginnys area of expertise
3230274 i think he is dating someone in your house and he wanted to keep it a secret so he didnt tell me and
3230275 there are others in your house who might be more keen on the gossip its true but the disadvantage of gossips is precisely that they talk i dont want anyone to know that im asking around and it will be easier for you to find out if my suspicions are true than you think
3230276 people respect you ron youre a hero if you ask a few questions people wont get suspicious
3230277 so malfoy broke up with you and you suspect he is dating a gryffindor right well i cant imagine anyone in
3230278 er but well i suppose he wouldnt want anyone in your house to find out about it if that is the case
3230279 i suppose id get some satisfaction from making the slippery git sweat but what else is in it for me
3230280 if you wouldnt mind accepting presents from a member of a dishonourable and sullied house such as mine id be happy to buy you some things you need or even get you something you want
3230281 right well that sounds reasonable youve obviously given this some thought what do you have in mind to make malfoy squirm
3230282 ask around you shouldnt have any trouble getting the girls in your house to speak to you
3230283 and how do you propose i go about asking around
3230284 play the knight in shining armour protecting the virtue of the gryffindor witches from the foul clutches of the ferret
3230285 if my suspicions are correct word will get back to malfoy and whomever hes dating might be scared enough to break it off so i can try to get him back
3230286 all right miss parkinson ill help ill wager youve given this some thought what now
3230287 now you talk to a few witches in your house start with the fifth and sixth years they will be more likely to speak to you word will get around that youre asking around and since its you asking you should get results by bedtime
3230288 then we should get back together and compare notes meet me on the pitch tomorrow before dinner well throw the quaffle around and maybe go have dinner in hogsmeade

3230293 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me
3230294 i wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew park tae hwan was going to have a good last 50 meters so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150

3230302 these are the building blocks which most forged products can be traced back to i thought it would be worth the effort to point out that the circle rectangle octagon and square are the graphic elements from which everything a blacksmith forges derives i interpreted this literally and re presented this idea by hanging the steel forms on the wall and covering their surfaces with a paintstick

3230328 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3230329 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3230330 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3230331 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3230332 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3230333 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3230334 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3230335 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3230349 dollar asia was strong yesterday and today i think a lot of players were stopped out
3230350 the combination of broad us dollar strength downward growth revisions to asia and a rebalancing of fx policy bias away from inflation prevention to growth promotion has prompted us to revise our asia fx forecasts
3230351 due to their domestic demand driven economies and improving real yields on falling inflation attracting portfolio inflows

3230360 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3230361 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3230362 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3230363 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3230364 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3230365 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3230366 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3230367 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3230368 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3230369 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3230370 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3230371 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3230372 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3230373 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective

3230714 restaurants are pretty good at supplementing ingredients like replacing a side of rice with pasta
3230715 but asian restaurants wouldnt be able to supplement too much

3230764 asking our members to vote on a strike authorization is a normal part of bargaining and is not an indicator that a strike is imminent
3230765 it is still our hope that that bargaining process will produce a fair contract that rewards the hard work of cwa members who have contributed to qwests success

3230791 nothing of this has happened before with their concert dates scheduled so close to each other this will definitely be an unforgettable two months for shinhwa fans in korea although there are worries that this tight scheduling might affect the ticket sales but we feel that this will lead to a healthy competition and might attract more people instead

3230802 i just want to make sure the board of aldermen and board of public works understand whats involved in this sort of thing
3230803 other times i think people recognize the difficulties that may be presented from the regulatory system if they try to follow it money drives everything
3230804 code enforcement is different from law enforcement in that way it is kind of like quasi law enforcement
3230805 if i can be the same shut down guy i was its all olympic size ice then maybe i can get back some of the skill and finesse i used to have
3230806 i didnt want to be one of those guys who goes over to europe to finish his career it might be a step forward for me
3230807 they called me up around mid season and i stayed up to the end of the year
3230808 if it was a different type of organization i would have signed but the way theyre going theyre giving the younger guys a shot
3230809 after the season i had 53 games and was named the teams most underrated player i didnt want to start the season in the minors the role i played they were going to start giving the younger guys a chance
3230810 a lot of these guys i was on their b list i was a safety valve for a lot of teams

3230814 rivalry week at southern new hampshire university while plans are underway to expand the league to five geographical locations next summer including one in nashua
3230815 i started giving it some thought and decided this is a short term situation and is one way to find out if this is something i want to do
3230816 i felt that i had a better handle on it than some of the people on the board
3230817 i figured maybe this is an opportunity to do something for the kids and do it from an elected position
3230818 i think fairies has the potential to be as big as princesses
3230819 we were fundamentally missing an opportunity in terms of getting tinker bell out there as a character
3230820 they brought with them an illustration that had been used when they were working on the animated bambi it was a beautiful illustration of a dove
3230821 the only thing she says in barrie is silly ass thats her line and she tries to have wendy killed a couple of times
3230822 but she also saves peter she drinks the poison to keep peter from drinking it i built on that on her love for peter her loyalty her courage she is not in my mind a warm fuzzy character
3230823 the big challenge disney has is to change it on one hand so it becomes more modern and appealing for the next generation but on the other hand theyre almost changing a religion they can very easily trip and fall down
3230824 you know how kids at a certain age start looking out the window and ask questions that parents have an impossible time answering why do leaves turn colors why are there dew drops those kinds of things

3230826 that sense of fantasy that you create in the film that you want to bring alive in the parks and with the characters

3230829 but thats not the way in mls where salary caps and other player acquisition mechanisms are set to keep the playing field if not completely level then pretty close to it major league soccer will never be an epl a serie a or la liga where two three or four teams bully the competition and perennially dominate the hardware there will be no chelsea man united ac milan barcelona or real madrid here baseball might work that way in this country hello yankees whats up red sox but this obviously isnt baseball

3230834 he has good instincts and he makes plays and thats what we like to see
3230835 hes always going one hundred percent and hes a tough competitor
3230836 obviously its a totally different game coming from college to the pro game
3230837 but i think anyone can make it in this league if youre willing to work hard enough
3230838 im just trying to be as good as i can be and work hard to help the team and most of all prove to everyone that im good enough to play in this league and that you can succeed by having faith in your abilities and working hard
3230839 yeah hes got a few skills you know competition in camp is always good it gets everyone to you know step up when a guys going all out like that
3230840 is that the material in this book is far older for the author makes it clear that his manuscript only explains in detail the work described in the tantra sangraha by nilakantha somayaji so the work spoken about is actually much older as nilakantha in the 15th century
3230841 the ganita yukti bhasa attributes its mathematical models work to madhava who lived from 1340 to 1420 thats way ahead of newton but it would be too sweeping a statement to say that this was the first work on calculus
3230842 the only kind of reform usually possible is reform from within a more intimate study and more intelligent use of the traditional forms
3230843 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3230844 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3230845 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3230848 rogers came out tonight he had a really good game he had some pressure from the defense but he stood in the pocket he handled himself really good and i think hell do a really good job here as a green bay packer
3230849 one drive was halfway decent but the first ones werent that good
3230850 i think hell do just fine hes been a trooper through the whole situation and i think thats what its all about
3230851 the big 4 can rarely find names big enough who are not cup tied at this point of the season
3230852 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3230854 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3230855 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3230856 victory is not won in miles but in inches win a little now hold your ground and later win a little more
3230857 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3230858 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3230859 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3230860 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3230861 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3230862 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3230863 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3230864 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3230865 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3230866 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3230867 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3230868 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3230869 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3230870 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3230871 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3230872 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3230873 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3230874 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3230875 is a good sense of humor intelligence and she cant be part of the ibtc
3230876 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3230877 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

3230881 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3230882 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3230883 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3230884 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3230885 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3230886 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3230887 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3230888 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3230889 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3230890 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3230891 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3230892 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3230893 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
3230894 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
3230895 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
3230896 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist
3230897 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
3230898 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
3230899 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
3230900 now that theyve met me they can see i dont have two horns and a tail
3230901 it is almost 3 weeks you being promoted as regional manager rm for southern part of india and i am not witnessing any progress
3230902 decoupling financial aid from individual colleges altogether and creating other organizations whose goal is to allocate funding to students independently of the schools that they attend
3230903 donors who are currently giving to colleges without really knowing where their money is spent will be able to give with the goal of funding students all while having more transparency into how their contributions are actually being put to good use

3230905 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3230906 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3230907 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3230908 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3230917 i was recruited to famu in 2004 and its been a roller coaster ride ever since
3230918 i was named most outstanding swimmer in northeastern conference most outstanding swimmer in coastal collegiate the first african american from an hbcu to qualify for the ncaa student athlete of the year
3230919 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3230920 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3230921 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3230922 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3230923 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3230924 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3230925 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3230926 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3230927 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3230928 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3230929 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3230930 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3230931 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3230932 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3230933 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3230934 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3230935 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3230936 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3230937 if we can understand why spacetime is already expanding we may be able to use this knowledge to artificially generate an expansion and contraction of spacetime
3230938 this is a hypothetical propulsion device that could theoretically circumvent the traditional limitations of special relativity which restricts spacecraft to sub light velocities any breakthrough in this field would revolutionize space exploration and open the doorway to interstellar travel

3230966 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3230967 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3230968 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3230969 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3230970 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3230971 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation

3230979 findings from this study suggest the significant role that built environment plays in either positively or negatively impacting our health and or lifestyle
3230980 34 of u s adults aged 20 and over are obese part of the rise in this disease may be attributed to our surroundings for example increased accessibility to unhealthy foods the built environment is also creating barriers for our ability to exercise many neighborhood areas lack parks and other recreational facilities and suburbs are often designed to discourage neighborhood walking simply focusing on encouraging people to change their lifestyles to eat better and to get more exercise is insufficient measures are also needed to improve features of the built environment which are often modifiable e g via changes in city zoning development policies to support people in making such changes

3230982 sir i should have gotten a few marks for creativity
3230983 raises questions on the return on investment but its a work in progress
3230984 i am pleased to see that our friends at the rhode island department of revenue have created this work in progress discussion paper
3230985 when analyzing the overall impact upon our state and our citizens one must consider the direct and indirect returns as well as the multiplier effect and future positive economic impacts including the need to attract new resilient and innovative industry and high paying employment to a state that is currently losing jobs at an alarming rate
3230986 on average every dollar invested by the state in the form of a motion picture production tax credit has returned 28 cents to the state
3230987 direct and indirect expenditures for the state to earn back the value of the tax credits issued
3230988 the analysis proves that subsidies for motion picture production are a bad investment of state funds and suggests that the only movie credits that are meaningful are the ones rolling at the end of the film
3230989 in these extraordinary tough fiscal times limited state resources should be invested in proven economic development strategies like work force training
3230990 additional tax revenue will be generated by ancillary economic activity associated with film production in massachusetts and by multiplier effects entailed by this related economic activity
3230991 since the advent of silent film and the birth of hollywood in the early 20th century the motion picture business has brought economic and cultural benefits to the states and communities that host projects of all sizes
3230992 something big happened that day i charged the mound greinke hit swisher and i think its over its no reason to have some anger or whatever
3230993 hey sometimes emotions get the best of you everything that happened it wasnt even a bad brawl it wasnt like it was bad blood after it was over they got a good team forget their record they play good ball
3230994 i wouldnt think thered be any cheap stuff going on though
3230995 maybe more intense maybe some more yelling going on but i dont think theres going to be any stupid stuff going on
3230996 it wasnt hard to see after we hit jermaine dye
3230997 someone was going to get hit and i just happened to be the first guy up i happen to be hitting the ball well so this next series they could be coming after me again not a big deal
3230998 ive gotten into brawls in the minor leagues and it always lasts a game or two
3230999 but it doesnt change it i think were rivals with everyone in our division
3231000 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3231001 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3231002 what do you do for people who cant afford the bulbs
3231003 this position gives me a lot more opportunities to effect change
3231004 a lot is going to happen with the changes in the administration next year there will be climate change legislation and i want to be part of that
3231005 im about trying to effect positive change and not running around saying the sky is falling
3231006 i think we can do a lot with the momentum that is building
3231007 and weve been contacted by a lot of groups who want to do similar efforts people feel they have to do something
3231008 but its cool to see the momentum being built and its fun to meet so many different people
3231009 ideas are valuable only inasmuch as they can be multiplied by execution
3231010 an idea is no more useful than a coupon for a bag of sugar show me the finished cake then well talk
3231011 i thought shea clearly played the best on saturday and thats what were going to go on
3231012 first and foremost ball security he wasnt as good as he has to be but he was the best ball handler out of the group
3231013 hes still got a long long ways to go but you can absolutely see that the guy has some talent
3231014 i think theres some things we can do with quintana in a tight end spot
3231015 i think hes a physical player i think he plays bigger than what hes listed at height and weight wise 6 foot 2 200 pounds and hes smart and hes tough

3231018 identifying the specific normal cells that cancers come from can provide critical insight into how cancers develop
3231019 this may help us develop more rational and effective approaches to treatment
3231020 simply mutating a gene is not enough to cause cancer
3231021 the mutation has to happen in the right cell type at the right time in the case of patched gnps provide the critical context for tumor formation
3231022 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3231023 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3231024 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3231025 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels
3231026 this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3231027 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3231028 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process
3231029 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function
3231030 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3231031 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3231032 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3231033 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3231034 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3231035 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3231036 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3231037 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease
3231038 hey im from minnesota we dont have oceans in minnesota im doing the best i can
3231039 i just dont think you can do this good things dont happen to good people look at your family go out and get a job
3231040 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask instead what makes your heart come alive because what the world needs are people whose hearts have come alive
3231041 i dont think theres anyone who doubts the possibility were going to win this time
3231042 people are angry the economy is shaky and people are feeling financially insecure
3231043 massachusetts is one giant perception that government is out of control and its an accurate perception
3231044 the big dig is a very visible example our per capita tax burden is one of the highest in the nation so is our debt so are our unfunded liabilities our public employee benefits
3231045 question 1 must pass or it sends the message that taxpayers in massachusetts will put up with anything
3231046 well be looking at a tax increase instead of a tax cut
3231047 in november voters will be faced with a ballot question to eliminate the state income tax the tax foundations report shows massachusetts moving in the right direction
3231048 im sure they will try to do whatever they can get away with
3231049 you know i dont look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

3231071 one of things about going from being fairly exotic to being sort of mainstream is that a lot of the considerations our customers had when we were working with them a few years ago are not the same consideration they have today our customers have certainly focused much more on the manageability and the monitoring what we refer to internally as project ipod this idea that just because youre controlling 10 000 cpus it doesnt mean it has to be as complex as configuring 10 000 servers for many of these applications it should be as simple as pressing the play button if it needs 10 000 cpus to do that it should be able to allocate deploy start up configure etc everything it needs to do across extreme scale environments and just as easily when its done with what it has to do if its no longer needed it should be able to fold itself back up and put itself away

3231088 i like being fucked on my back being licked having my nipples squeezed and my dildo sucked
3231089 i was sleeping and my boyfriend at the time stuck his cock in my mouth and came
3231090 my last sexual experience was last night i was also sleeping and then my girlfriend slipped off her skirt and lightly rubbed her nipples on my lips
3231091 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another

3231096 we went back in and roughed up the studio version a bit i think it gives a fair idea of the kind of energy on the album
3231097 c lebrity is really a comment on the current concept of fame success and all that goes with it getting your face on tv is enough talent doesnt really enter into the equation celebrity is an overused and devalued word today
3231098 i see the song as roger s take on the increasing emphasis on fame for its own sake its quite ironic that andy warhol s statement that everyone will have fifteen minutes of fame is becoming something of a reality although it may be down to fifteen seconds in todays world of instant communication
3231099 we know we have a pretty tough road especially through september when we have five games in 15 days that will test our mental and physical strength
3231100 the home games are certainly a must to win with perth and wellington in the first three rounds the ambition is to take six points you need to win home games to give yourself a chance
3231101 we had a decent start last year scoring goals but were having draws and not winning which builds up pressure
3231102 you have to feel the pressure every day adelaide has had a good history wants to win things and do well that is what united has been about since day one
3231103 isnt working the way it should and hasnt for some time

3231111 theres a huge panic were here to say theres nothing
3231112 the main legend of georgia is that georgians are warriors because they are subject to constant invasion
3231113 many of them now think it is the last chance to defend their homeland
3231114 it comes from the knowledge that the army is not enough and every man is valuable
3231115 you have to go to each hospital because it changes all the time
3231116 were going to say okay this is what tysons should look like
3231117 here are the things that go into a functioning urban tysons and heres how were going to get there
3231118 the task force has made it clear it wants to charge ahead without any real clarity as to what its doing
3231119 i think there are people who would like to frame it that way the irony of some voices is that they hate tysons they think its dysfunctional they think its congested and crowded and they dont want to change a thing and thats just not tenable

3231127 im disappointed that the prosecutors office felt it was necessary to bring charges that require a mandatory minimum 13 years on the three firearms charges in prison if convicted
3231128 i believe when this case is ultimately tried and all the facts are brought before the court no jury or judge would feel that any jail time is warranted in this case
3231129 at this point i think its her attorneys obligation to put forth any sort of mitigating evidence if they want us to consider it

3231151 taken into consideration in the future in contacts about other global questions

3231153 its not up to me i mean i cant make the decision so it is for americans
3231154 their political goal was to eliminate the population a tiny population of southern ossetia because without it its impossible to integrate back southern ossetia into georgia

3231168 as i understand it there are no products of good quality on the market for men
3231169 should there be such products specifically for men then there is nothing stopping us from selling them
3231170 ive also seen that great men are often lonely this is understandable because they have built such high standards for themselves that they often feel alone but that same loneliness is part of their ability to create
3231171 flos happy and the team is happy to cut that off at the pass before it got into a free agent scramble
3231172 i know he didnt want to go into it and really travel around and do that whole deal
3231173 i still put us at the top of the nfc
3231174 i feel confident in saying that because all the best teams are pretty much in our division the giants and cowboys are coming off great seasons and the redskins had a decent year
3231175 if we eliminate the mistakes in the red zone and do some better things on defense its a different story
3231176 you mean if hed realized the situation he was in
3231177 in his situation hes finally maturing at age 35 actually 34 sometimes its you sometimes its me t o thought for so long it was someone else but at some point maybe it dawns on you that its not everyone elses fault i think once bill parcells left t o realized that jerry jones truly loved him and now he has a quarterback that he feels comfortable with hes listening sometimes you have to understand the reality of the whole situation and i think he did that
3231178 what did we have 30 tds you dont see that type of combination very often thats like peyton manning and marvin harrison we would have been up there

3231192 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3231193 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3231194 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3231195 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3231196 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3231197 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3231198 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3231199 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3231200 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3231201 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3231202 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3231203 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3231204 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast

3231209 youd never know he was 61 its unbelievable how much energy he has
3231210 i just needed to be reminded how good he is as a coach and certainly as a position coach
3231211 in the meeting rooms hes just outstanding hes going to make a big impact
3231212 i dont know that bitter is the term anytime you try to do something and it doesnt work out its disappointing
3231213 the reason i got into coaching was because i like being around the players
3231214 sometimes the coordinator and the head coach is more of a manager than he is a teacher so i am very comfortable with what im doing im happy
3231215 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3231216 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3231217 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and transatlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship
3231218 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today

3231241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3231242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3231243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3231244 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3231245 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3231246 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3231247 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3231248 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3231261 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
3231262 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan

3231271 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3231272 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3231273 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3231274 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
3231275 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3231276 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3231277 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3231278 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3231279 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3231280 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3231281 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3231282 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
3231283 the blood pressure reduction was unexpected as this was not a trial to determine whether exercise would reduce blood pressure
3231284 clinicians will always decry not having enough time to counsel but a method of using a prescription pad with exercise recommendations as suggested in the study will help solve this quandary
3231285 to the fact that preventive health services do not practically reach a very high priority in our medical system
3231286 if someone becomes ill with a heart attack many thousands of dollars are spent without question but if a physician needs to spend time counseling patients insurers typically do not reimburse well for these vital services
3231287 it sets the benchmark for comparison with current studies and future studies
3231288 is very unfortunate as such counseling is inexpensive and recommended by the u s preventive services task force a very well respected organization of health prevention experts

3231341 we have signed some exciting players and hopefully the fans are looking forward to seeing them
3231342 but if we work hard im sure we can get some good results
3231343 this squad of players has got us where we are now and we mustnt forget that but we still need to add more quality and more depth
3231344 i think we all know we are going to have to work hard especially now because we are playing in the premier league
3231345 he chose to join us ahead of several other top flight clubs
3231346 selling a 29 year old fullback for 6 million pounds a year after we bought him for stg2 5 million a5 41 million and doing so in the knowledge that we will replace him is right for the football club in the short term medium term and the long term
3231347 i dont see any reason why we wont be a successful partnership but the managers got a lot of options in attack so im really going to have to hit the ground running
3231348 hell get better this year which is great news for liverpool and got to be a worry for the rest of the division
3231349 he makes great runs holds the ball up well to allow support to get around him and when he gets the chance in front of goal hes deadly
3231350 they can spend stg20 million a43 31 million on players just for the bench but my belief is unshakable that we can compete with them
3231351 we are not the richest club and we have had a lot of work to do but i have kept my desire and my confidence that it is possible to win
3231352 a lot of 20 or stg25 million a54 14 million players
3231353 the key is not to say we will win the title because the premier league is now the best and most difficult in europe
3231354 we have improved and progressed every year since i arrived the standard has risen massively and we have had to work to keep up
3231355 maybe our european success hasnt helped us because it made people believe we were ready to challenge for the league when we were not
3231356 i cant see anyone breaking the top four this season
3231357 i think villa will go close and will be a danger to everyone they will be a top six side that is where we want to be as well but there are so many good sides proper sides who will be there or thereabouts
3231358 the challenge is there it is there to be done but i dont think it can be done in a year or two
3231359 we might not have the biggest squad this season and we might not have the best squad in the premier league because there are some big clubs out there with big squads and a lot of quality players
3231360 but we can be the fittest team and that is what we have tried to do
3231361 i know a lot of other clubs have been interested in him hell be a terrific addition to the squad hes an exciting player and im sure our fans will enjoy watching him
3231362 we can do anything we want anything we put our minds to
3231363 weve got a great manager whos come in and youve seen what he did last year the fitness and level of play has risen and i want to be part of that
3231364 its all there for us if were all up for it its quite possible
3231365 its important to have a solution to every kind of problem or argument that comes up

3231594 the attorney they hired has attempted to denigrate me in the press by misrepresenting my actions and most of the time outright lying about the facts of the case
3231595 if theres any distortion of the facts i would suggest its by the senator who has a fanciful or inaccurate recollection of what actually occurred
3231596 ive always been a bike rider and have always had my ears and eyes on cycling concerns in the city
3231597 do everything in my power to make this city as bikeable as it can be

3231600 theres clearly some work we need to do in our police bureau
3231601 although attitudes are changing in pittsburgh its still not as friendly as it could be
3231602 i think his grounding was really in pittsburgh thats where he was raised and he grew up at a time when work ethic thrived
3231603 we all stayed together because of him because of him and my mom the extended family gets together all the time
3231604 i know grandparents stay involved with grandkids when theyre young but he stayed involved through their 20s
3231605 two things meant most to his life family and work he put a lot of time in both
3231606 the jersey shore atlantic city to cape may great destination
3231607 this is unusual we seldom get a jail term in connection with a case like this involving sales of alcohol to minors or underage adults
3231608 you want a big lesson drawn from this so others can be careful when they work in this industry when you let somebody go easy like this you are not sending a strong message
3231609 typically after dormancy like this you will need to water once a week for about an hour every time
3231610 do that for a couple weeks and you will start to see your lawn green up again
3231611 mow high 2 5 would be about a minimum 3 inches is even better and that will actually promote deep root growth so your lawn can take up water thats deeper in the soil

3231614 remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
3231615 all those articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3231616 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3231617 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3231618 democrats who share the misconception are significantly less likely to support obama
3231619 the judges entire analysis of what is tiffanys responsibility with respect to the site versus ebays starts from an incorrect basis
3231620 based solely on their generalised knowledge that trademark infringement might be occurring on their web sites
3231621 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue
3231622 its ebays obligation once it has knowledge to take the knowledge to investigate and stop the sale of counterfeit merchandise
3231623 tiffanys decision to carry this litigation on after the district courts decision doesnt do anything to combat counterfeiting
3231624 i shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material i understand to be embraced within that shorthand description
3231625 and perhaps i could never succeed in intelligibly doing so but i know it when i see it

3231637 unlike the intravenous drug application of oxycyte in traumatic brain injury this would be a topical application applied to the skin or to the surface of wounds so were hopeful that the clinical review process would be as a medical device which can be shorter and faster than review as a drug

3231669 everyone in the political world has weighed in on revelations regarding john edwardss extramarital affair
3231670 i continue to think theres a good reason mccain should be worried about this story if adultery and presidential candidates becomes a topic of discussion he has a lot to lose
3231671 in some ways i couldnt be more pleased if republicans really want to go down this road dems would be wise to follow their lead indeed john edwards himself quickly recognized the political salience of this angle
3231672 from december 2006 until this past friday john and elizabeth edwards engaged themselves in a grand public deception against democrats in particular and the american people in general about edwardss affair they did this both john and elizabeth did it in light of and despite what bill clinton had done to their own party and to the country from late 1995 until early 1999 so dont feel too sorry for elizabeth edwards she knew what she was doing so did john
3231673 personally i dont care what politicians marriages are like but i really think that its a mistake for conservatives to make marriage fidelity an issue when their standard bearer has his own share of problems in that arena edwards is not his partys nominee
3231674 still remember when edwards was arguing that he was the most electable his run this year has to go down as one of the more incredibly stupid decisions in recent political history he should have just run as a republican where such indiscretions dont matter as long as they happen with members of the opposite sex
3231675 charles evans hughes forgot something when he wrote the us supreme courts landmark near v minnesota decision in 1931
3231676 the chief justice listed national security obscenity and the imminent threat of violence as essentially the only three reasons that the courts could ever step in and order someone not to exercise his right to free speech what he left out information that could result in the mbtas losing some fare money what a bonehead eh for good measure the t is suing mit too for the grave offense of not teaching its students how to be good charliecard paying citizens
3231677 is the notion that trying to keep a lid on these undergrads results will improve the ts security the truth of the matter is that if these three undergraduates can defeat the charliecard then lots of people can the t is opting for the illusion of security rather than real security e g open source security that can be vetted and tested by anyone
3231678 ironically the students vulnerability assessment report that the mbta filed with its lawsuit contains even more compromising information than the students planned to present in their talk so basically by filing a lawsuit the t raised more awareness about its vulnerabilities than they would have by simply ignoring the defcon speech and also offered up the details on its systems weaknesses for anyone to download and exploit way to go mbta

3231687 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3231688 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3231690 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n
3231691 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3231692 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3231693 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3231694 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3231695 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3231696 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3231697 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3231698 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3231699 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3231700 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3231701 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3231702 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3231703 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3231704 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3231705 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3231706 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3231707 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3231708 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3231709 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3231710 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3231711 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3231712 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3231713 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3231718 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3231719 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3231720 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3231721 como en cada caso de violaci n a los derechos humanos exijamos juicio y castigo digamos ni perd n ni olvido y rechacemos la impunidad

3231727 there were thousands of people who were facing disability who could get back to full productivity with the classic contoured keyboard
3231728 the keyboards make enough of a difference to eliminate the pain in computer use
3231729 a lot of patients think they have to rest if something hurts
3231730 but often its just the opposite even with knee arthritis the more you exercise in the right way the better your symptoms become thats very counterintuitive to most people
3231731 people who are no longer very athletic dig an old pair of shoes out of the back of their closet
3231732 the shoes may not fit anymore or they may be worn out then they go out and try to cram several years worth of athletic activity into a short period of time
3231733 a lot of them are starting to retire and have newfound freedom to pursue hobbies and passions
3231734 they go from not doing anything to going at warp speed
3231735 playing tennis socially has been the healthiest thing ive done for myself
3231736 i dont think of myself as 49 and therefore i tend to do things that are not 49 year old things
3231737 the tissues start to degenerate a little bit and become maybe a little more susceptible as we age but an active lifestyle keeps us healthy
3231738 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3231739 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3231740 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3231741 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3231742 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3231743 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3231744 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3231745 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3231746 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3231747 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3231748 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3231749 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3231750 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3231751 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3231752 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3231753 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3231754 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3231755 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3231756 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3231757 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3231758 it seemed so weird last time we spoke you admitted to a lifelong fear of condiments i dont want to get you upset
3231759 this is good news for a young man who appeared to have an excellent career in front of him
3231760 but it also sends out a message to everyone about the duty of care they have to their opponents
3231761 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3231762 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
3231763 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3231764 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
3231765 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
3231766 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
3231767 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
3231768 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
3231769 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
3231770 i want this to end when im on top so im planning my final show on december 21 2012 its when the mayan calendar ends its the day when solids become liquids and liquids become plasmas
3231771 so im building up to that weve got four years so maybe theres going to be a couple other small releases in the works the album just came out so i have no plans for another release but im constantly starting to work on new stuff just for the live shows
3231772 i used to play very short sets and now i kinda play a standard 45 minute to one hour set so i think i wanna do a 24 hour set and i want it to be a stage production but one where the lines become blurry between reality and complete stage me i want it to be an endurance test and i want it to be miserable and equally fantastic i want the best of both worlds
3231773 i think in too many shows people are too aimed at pleasing the audience if you want to do a really great show which i havent fully done yet you have to really make it bad for them for like 20 hours and then you can kill it for four hours and everyone will be really excited i think people ignore the dynamics of how you can work with an audience
3231774 the lord of the rings the return of the king
3231775 we didnt know if she would ever talk or walk or if she would spend life in a wheelchair
3231776 the current state of the art in the entire universe
3231777 but you have to do it it was her only chance to have the normal life that she wanted

3231783 last night i was talking to the person who first introduced me to atmosphere on a mix tape ah the lost art of the mix tape which had the woman with the tattooed hands on it she said she forever lost her faith in slug when she saw him live he was bringing up random girls on stage making out with them then talking shit and kicking them off its a second hand account and rappers dont have to be heroes but i certainly expected something more from someone as thoughtful ie full of thought as slug
3231784 slug could very well be my favorite poet of his generation
3231785 nos parece que la marcha es una manera de manifestar esa indignaci n que existe por parte de la sociedad y por supuesto el gobierno apoya

3231809 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3231810 the big read reckons that the average adult has only read 6 of the top 100 books theyve printed
3231811 we have been playing well ever since we started practice they play all summer and work on their games
3231812 i played pretty well hit the driver well and hit a lot of greens
3231813 winning this tournament means a lot its a tradition and it takes a lot of work
3231814 i tried for the middle of the green and it worked out it was the same spot as earlier in the round
3231815 the short game is the main part of the game
3231816 you have to be able to make the putt and make the chip
3231817 i made a lot of four and five footers to score
3231818 ive been playing really well this last week and i didnt want to shoot anything over par today
3231819 that all the success in the world would not compensate if i failed at home
3231820 those kids around your feet will be grown and gone before you know it dont let the opportunity of these days slip away from you no professional accomplishment or success is worth that cost
3231821 when youre on your deathbed you wont be thinking about box office numbers or who your co star was youll think about your family about the decisions you make about the people you love

3231824 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3231825 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3231826 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3231827 drunken and loutish holidaymakers have sent britains reputation abroad plunging to new depths

3231829 watching dick clarks new years rockin eve is an american tradition
3231830 ryan has been a tremendous part of the show the last couple of years and were thrilled hell be part of it for years to come
3231831 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3231832 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3231833 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3231834 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3231835 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3231836 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3231837 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3231838 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3231839 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3231840 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3231841 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3231842 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3231843 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3231844 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3231845 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3231846 i just wanted to be out at the 50 metre point and thats where i was i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3231847 i knew park is strong in the last 50 metres
3231848 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3231849 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3231850 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3231851 amd continues to look at multiple options that leverage our world class manufacturing capabilities and relationships to achieve an optimum blend of internal and external operations
3231852 they know how to run a fab and they do it well and for the most part thats been a big help
3231853 a separate foundry function might enable it to compete with intel without the capital required to keep up from a manufacturing standpoint
3231854 by taking ownership of the fabs this fund might go a long way toward seeing its investment pay off
3231855 is this meeting necessary can we accomplish our goals without spending time in a meeting
3231856 what were working on is trying to grow the rest of the organization in the consumer electronics and the games industry and were having some success there
3231857 this operation pre dates project wickenby but it is another example of how the afp in concert with its project wickenby partners continues to focus on arrangements involving offshore secrecy havens and money laundering to ensure those involved pay their fair share of tax
3231858 restaurants are pretty good at supplementing ingredients like replacing a side of rice with pasta
3231859 but asian restaurants wouldnt be able to supplement too much
3231860 theyll be using less of it but do they increase their prices or do they just wear the higher costs
3231861 if people order 10 bags of rice i might sell them three or four
3231862 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3231863 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing
3231864 its a good music thing we jam about good things from the heart how can you pick between me and trent reznor
3231865 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3231866 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
3231867 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids
3231868 wake up in london go to sleep on atlanta time still my paint got more candy than your valentine
3231869 trouble i dont shy away from it i annihilate suckas in their driveway in church on sunday morning praying bout what happened friday
3231870 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
3231871 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
3231872 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
3231873 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3231874 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3231875 exige como uno de los requisitos para ser alcalde residir en el municipio de que se trate durante al menos los tres 3 ltimos a os previos a su elecci n
3231876 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3231877 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3231878 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3231879 a dime would mean 5 71 a month for the average person but about 123 a month for us
3231880 that would nevertheless be a fair equitable responsible way to raise revenue and everyone would contribute
3231881 im willing to bet we couldnt get more than 10 of them to vote for it
3231882 but the square footage is deceiving because there is so much packed into the store there is no inefficient use of space its spectacular we are now finally getting supermarkets back in the city
3231883 i liked iga because ill be totally independent i can do anything that i want
3231884 the entire community is very excited to have the grocery store
3231885 it will give the student body and the rest of the community a chance to stay local
3231886 when the project was conceptualized it was conceptualized with a subsidy
3231887 you cant do any of this stuff without a subsidy none of it makes sense
3231888 there was a commitment when steve leeper was the sports amp exhibition authority director that there would be no additional taxpayer money used in the development between the stadiums somebody has decided to change that rule thats not surprising given everything thats happened in the past year on this land
3231889 given that they were able to purchase the land at one fifteenth of its value at some point we have to question why all the benefits are being given to one developer for one piece of land
3231890 right now the land is sitting there it is generating zero revenue except parking revenue for the sports amp exhibition authority the steelers will buy the land at a value determined six years ago they will put up an entertainment facility that will pay sales tax back to the state liquor taxes back to the state real estate taxes back to the city county and school district and income taxes back to the city and the state
3231891 the sum total of that will be an excellent return back to the state
3231892 with todays technology and the tools we have its important to get information back out there again and hopefully clear an old case
3231893 were back to square one we feel now is an appropriate time to re energize this case with the help from the public in hopes that we can find a name out there that we have yet to investigate
3231894 this is a truly innocent victim were trying to provide some closure safety and solace to her
3231895 were reaching out to the community at large to try to get the final information that we need to hopefully close this investigation and yield some arrests
3231896 its a very difficult case but we have dna and we hope to get positive matches in the future
3231897 you didnt max out your own cards that is a very telling part of what you did
3231898 the only thing that stopped klorczyk is because we caught her
3231899 before she was caught she was brazen now i expect she is contrite
3231900 he was a student of the game that was the biggest thing he tried to make his game as good as it could be in every aspect
3231901 we always encourage our players to watch as much film as they can the ones that come back and tell you what theyve seen and ask questions are the ones who are doing a good job studying film
3231902 and it never failed jerod was going to have questions about what he saw on film then later in his career hed start to point out tips that would help everybody occasionally hed come in with things he picked up that i hadnt even seen at that point
3231903 were pretty multiple in things we run the thing our players had to be good at was understanding concepts and he never had any problems doing that its an entirely different level there but he did it so well for us
3231904 hes very intelligent it doesnt surprise me hes been able to go in and pick up what theyre doing the thing is hes very coachable hell buy into what his coaches are telling him
3231905 everybody is good at this level so you have to be up to par on your film
3231906 but i enjoy the ins and outs the xs and os of the game
3231907 but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000
3231908 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3231909 if i was independently wealthy and i didnt need an income i would do this for nothing thats how much i love it
3231910 i labeled it early on as a cda a caveman digital assistant
3231911 the final straw was that i couldnt find the notes that i wrote on a piece of wood
3231912 so my initial intent was to find something that would keep all these things together where i could find them
3231913 on the way home i passed the pharmacy and realized probably the best thing to mount it on was a wrist brace
3231914 this product has self promoted itself by making me more efficient it has allowed me the extra time to pursue it
3231915 its the place for people who havent traveled around the world but want their homes to look like they have
3231916 i dont think that theres any gym that could tell you that they hadnt
3231917 were the same as we were last year so we havent seen any growth
3231918 people figure they can save a little bit of money and still get the exercise they need
3231919 so far weve seen no impact of the economy on our business
3231920 our comparable sales for our revenue base are up double digit that would be membership revenue personal training revenue spa shop everything we do
3231921 weve had a large number of people come forward saying yeah thats him
3231922 were waiting for further verification through investigative techniques or resources
3231923 we are not able to rely on a photograph identification
3231924 any identification we obtain especially for this defendant must be checked double checked supported and verified by every means possible this defendants efforts to avoid identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value
3231925 he said im not a violent man ive never murdered anybody he wasnt that close to them
3231926 there is some concern it isnt sympathetic enough with the existing built environment
3231927 it would serve us well to step back and take a breath
3231928 everybody has opinions it is one of the things that makes the city a great city people care
3231929 obviously we would prefer that he serve his sentence at the earliest possible convenience
3231930 i think he enjoyed the role playing he had a certain charisma but it was the media who made him a celebrity
3231931 so why not give a car to all state employees who need to attend meetings
3231932 the evidence keeps piling up that this is the worst run state after louisiana
3231933 est bamos patrullando un barrio de fallujah cuna de varios ataques violentos en los ltimos tiempos buscando informaci n y armas relacionadas con al qaeda en irak de repente un mensaje lleg por la radio tenemos un muerto y dos heridos qu dense donde est n los saldos comenzaron a hablar entre ellos cuando un comandante entr de repente vamos mu vanse ya agarramos muestro equipamiento armadura cascos guantes gafas y dem s cosas y salimos corriendo de la casa
3231934 el soldado que corr a a mi lado mir al suelo hab a una oreja y parte de una cabeza nos miramos y nos dimos cuenta que est bamos viviendo una locura y s lo era el principio
3231935 una docena de personas perdieron la vida entre los que hab a chicos abuelos ciudadanos polic as y militares la escena fue terror fica m s all de las palabras incluso para alguien como yo acostumbrado a vivir en el umbral de estas cosas
3231936 es una guerra y no podemos retratar s lo a soldados distribuyendo caramelos tambi n hay que mostrar la muerte
3231937 present im genes que mostraron una vista sin censura de un evento terrible con una peque a medida de dignidad para aquellos que perdieron sus vidas
3231938 esper tres d as antes de publicarlas me asegur de que los cuerpos no eran identificables y que las familias estuviesen informadas
3231939 ive always been a bike rider and have always had my ears and eyes on cycling concerns in the city
3231940 do everything in my power to make this city as bikeable as it can be
3231941 twenty years ago this would have been a laughable effort
3231942 pittsburgh has a long way to go but were making good progress
3231943 theres clearly some work we need to do in our police bureau
3231944 although attitudes are changing in pittsburgh its still not as friendly as it could be
3231945 despite my acquittal it is easy to see that voters can have doubts about my character given what the media unfairly wrote about me
3231946 their tabloid like reporting has tarnished my reputation in this community and made it more difficult to seek re election
3231947 i am unwilling to put my family friends and supporters through the type of negative campaign that my opponent would likely conduct
3231948 i urged her to consider it and she said she would she just came off an election last year so she wants to talk to her family
3231949 but senator regola outlined his reasons for withdrawing and i did not try to dissuade him
3231950 he called me for counsel it was probably the toughest conversation ive had with anyone i will certainly miss him in the republican caucus
3231951 the attorney they hired has attempted to denigrate me in the press by misrepresenting my actions and most of the time outright lying about the facts of the case
3231952 if theres any distortion of the facts i would suggest its by the senator who has a fanciful or inaccurate recollection of what actually occurred
3231953 i think his grounding was really in pittsburgh thats where he was raised and he grew up at a time when work ethic thrived
3231954 we all stayed together because of him because of him and my mom the extended family gets together all the time
3231955 i know grandparents stay involved with grandkids when theyre young but he stayed involved through their 20s
3231956 two things meant most to his life family and work he put a lot of time in both
3231957 they are a world class university and understand how to work well with industry
3231958 we dont have a timeline but were looking for great ideas for the short term and much longer term
3231959 creating the next generation of sophisticated technologies requires long term vision and collaboration with world class innovators
3231960 well be looking for ways to sense what a person is doing or thinking so that the character can respond appropriately
3231961 whether the character is a robot or a virtual creation the interaction issues are the same we need to figure out what sensors to build and how to interpret and respond to human behavior
3231962 cmu is no 1 in the world and that was obvious to disney
3231963 to make a park experience that is more interactive and responsive
3231964 the principal investigators are world class people who develop their own research
3231965 yeah weve got you covered at the 300 price point and a new ultra powerful behemoth is coming real soon too maybe you should hold onto your upgrade money for a bit
3231966 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3231967 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3231968 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3231969 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3231970 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3231971 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3231972 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3231973 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3231974 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3231975 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3231976 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3231977 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3231978 meticulous efforts were made to ensure the sequence was as unnoticeable as possible
3231979 they sought advice from the beijing meteorological office as to how to re create the hazy effects of beijings smog at night and inserted a slight camera shake effect to simulate the idea that it was filmed from a helicopter
3231980 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
3231981 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
3231982 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
3231983 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
3231984 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3231985 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3231986 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3231987 the line was so long i was like what is this
3231988 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3231989 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3231990 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3231991 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues

3231994 no one gets an ironclad guarantee of success certainly factors like opportunity luck and timing are important but the backbone of success is usually found in old fashioned basic concepts like hard work determination good planning and perseverance

3232011 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3232012 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3232013 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3232014 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3232015 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3232016 i feel for those people who missed out on the block of land they wanted
3232017 but as we speak today there are still 56 blocks of land available through that process
3232018 we wouldnt want to get to a situation where theres a glut of land because then theres a situation with equity people have in existing properties
3232019 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3232020 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3232021 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3232022 he chose to be in the pacific when most of his peers went off to postings in north america europe and asia
3232023 he is well read and the most conscientious sensitive and meticulous senior diplomat in our region i have had the privilege of working with during his term as sg
3232024 i doubt whether others would ever emulate let alone fill the very large shoes that he leaves behind with his resignation on medical grounds
3232025 in short i can describe his achievements as carvings on stone they last forever
3232026 he was a great role model for a young diplomat
3232027 i will deeply miss his wise counsel his company and his friendship greg will nevertheless continue to serve as an inspiration for those working in and for the region
3232028 his legacy will be twofold first a sense of the possibilities that exist in relations between australia and the countries of the region and second a vision of our region as a peaceful prosperous and proud community of nations working together for the common good
3232029 mr urwin has a passion for history and politics and has always read widely in both fields this interest has stood him in good stead throughout his career not least during his tenure as forum secretary general when the region faced a range of difficult political challenges
3232030 he helped to enhance the forums international standing on the world stage
3232031 he is the least pretentious of leaders and quickly puts others at ease taken together those two attributes meant that greg was always a very persuasive advocate mr batley said
3232032 in our view he made time to hear the concerns of ngos but it did not end there as he certainly facilitated more formal spaces for future dialogue between ngos and forum officials and governments
3232033 his term would be remembered by pcrc for institutionalising processes that enabled regional ngos to participate in forum meetings beyond the ad hoc arrangements that existed before
3232034 for the first time regional ngos such as those of us that are members of the prngos alliance previously know an prngos were able to meet with him two directors and relevant staff twice a year to address issues and concerns that were of interest to pacific ngos
3232035 his constant advice to us was that the path to more formal and comprehensive engagement of ngos in forum processes would be a work in progress and done incrementally and needed the endorsement of all 16 forum member governments and budgetary support
3232036 in this regard he was a supporter of civil society dialogue and processes

3232039 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
3232040 it was just a weird kind of deal i think he got stepped on or he stepped funny
3232041 i feel bad for him because he came in and worked really hard and was going to push for a lot of playing time
3232042 byron was a no 1 pick the seventh overall in the draft
3232043 hes started in the league won games in the league were happy to have him here to kind of bail us out
3232044 its been the same injury time and time again but i never got it fixed because i wasnt a doctor and nobody told me hey you need to get that fixed
3232045 once i got it fixed its better now last year i got something different a high ankle sprain on the other ankle
3232046 your quarterbacks throwing motion is his throwing motion and thats not going to change a whole lot
3232047 everyone knows byrons got a little of an elongated motion and hes going to have to make it up with smarts and anticipation
3232048 i feel as though im a little slower with my windup so i just throw the ball faster and it gets there at the same time
3232049 i was impressed simply by the fact hes a quick study
3232050 he was able to step out there step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up actually and deliver the ball around hes a very sharp guy thats obvious i would guess hell be able to play on thursday
3232051 i just want to play football and help the team as much as i can
3232052 thats my mind set just go out there become a better player help this football team see what happens
3232053 its different because youre not the guy and you used to be the guy
3232054 we all know who the guy is my job is to prepare myself every day in case im needed and if im needed i have to go out there and we cant miss a beat and thats what im going to work myself toward
3232055 i dont see it as a negative im not a big fan of the preseason and all that banging and stuff anyway for older guys
3232056 we know how to play football being an older guy and being in the same system for this long period of time
3232057 it saved me a little bit but its time to go its time to get out there and go to work with my teammates and im ready
3232058 coach made a decision and hes the coach im here to help this team win im willing to do that any way i can and whatevers asked of me ill do it
3232059 as of right now it looks like hes knocking the rust off pretty quickly we anticipate him participating on thursday unless he has a setback
3232060 i just came into this year with a different focus
3232061 this is my year i have a one year contract so i have to prove to the coaches i can handle whatever they give me
3232062 you cant dress a backup at every position because of all the numbers
3232063 having a guy who can play more than one position helps out a lot so it helps me
3232064 its not money i want to play this is my fourth year ive been a spot guy for three years i just want to play
3232065 i assume he is but when that will occur i dont know at this point
3232066 i would think so but you never know in this business
3232067 it was definitely after the play i made the tackle im getting up and my knee was still bent and the guy just came in and hit me most definitely a cheap shot the play was well over
3232068 its less about the surgery and more about the rehabilitation at this point
3232069 im going to kill you in your sleep and not leave any evidence
3232070 he hasnt felt this good in a long long time
3232071 he hasnt felt this good in a long long time
3232072 not that everyone has to do it but she felt the need to educate people that the option is out there
3232073 the more things change the more they stay the same
3232074 personnel turnover is something that can change your thesis behind owning a fund
3232075 so you need to look at any change and see if it has made the fund better you certainly hope they wont replace the old manager with something worse but you need to make sure you feel comfortable that what you have now is at least as good if not better than the manager who was there before

3232077 conducted a poll just after clintons senate reelection in november 2006 that showed her running a very distant third in iowa barely ahead of the states governor
3232078 this presented a basic conundrum should clinton run a positive campaign to persuade iowans to reconsider her or should she run a negative campaign that would accuse her opponents of being untrustworthy and under qualified clintons top advisers
3232079 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to
3232080 due to the perishable nature of tv news and the difficulty of distribution
3232081 1cast provides a real time aggregation and delivery platform that enables consumers to get a worldview of the news that is important to them and enables broadcasters and programmers to distribute their content in a way that preserves their brand integrity and adds additional revenue streams

3232121 it felt like an organized street fight the way everyone was crowded around the players and how crazy they were going after each hit
3232122 i was excited because we had a really good turn out for it being that early in the morning
3232123 saturday the guys really werent themselves and we know it but today monday they came out and practiced hard
3232124 execution wise we are where i thought we should have been saturday but i was wanting our emotion to be higher than what it was today monday it was a lot higher and i told them it are days like today we have to build from and keep taking it to a high level
3232125 i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that comes after me is mightier than i whose shoes im not worthy to bear he shall baptize you in the holy spirit and with fire
3232126 do not leave jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which you have heard me speak about for john truly baptized with water but in a few days you will be baptized in the holy spirit
3232127 they were all together in one place suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them all of them were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
3232128 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit the promise is to you and your children and for all who are far off for all whom the lord our god will call
3232129 as i began to speak the holy spirit came on them as he had come on us in the beginning
3232130 the gift of the holy spirit had been poured out even on the gentiles
3232131 they have received the holy spirit just as we have
3232132 this is a turn of the century building the floor plan is obsolete
3232133 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3232134 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3232135 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3232136 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3232137 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3232138 im too lazy to put sunscreen on a lot of guys do the company supplies it
3232139 i dont think of whats happening in the future to my body
3232140 but what looks good today isnt going to look good later
3232141 i get brown i dont burn i dont really think about it
3232142 there is an epidemic of skin cancers ranging from basal cell to melanoma and its largely a result of exposure to the sun and tanning practices

3232148 why not grow a watermelon into a square shape by inserting the melons into square tempered glass cases while the fruit is still growing on the vine
3232149 no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it
3232150 what do you think are the most important problems facing this country today
3232151 if i were required to guess off hand and without collusion with higher minds what is the bottom cause of the amazing material and intellectual advancement of the last fifty years i should guess that it was the modern born and previously non existent disposition on the part of men to believe that a new idea can have value
3232152 but i heard you say something what did you say
3232153 did you did you did you just call me a fussy pot
3232154 the victim was in his front yard when he botti came barreling out of his car with a shotgun and said give me my money
3232155 hes running to a house and hes firing a gun in a neighborhood over 200 bucks
3232156 he was trying to settle a dispute albeit with bad judgment
3232157 we did a lot of things well we executed very well on both sides of the ball its what you want for a first scrimmage
3232158 our goal from day 1 of two a days was to be better today than yesterday to be better tomorrow over today we were better today than friday
3232159 i see a team with talent that shows me a lot in practice once we face an opponent though we seem to stop
3232160 we have receivers that go 6 3 6 2 and 6 1 and we cant throw the ball we have 6 2 250 pound tackles and guards that go around 210 and cant run the ball its a mental thing right now
3232161 what i saw today that pleased me the most was how we played with intensity and emotion we talk about that a lot
3232162 we played a lot of kids and got a chance to see what they can do against live competition obviously we have a lot of work to do but thats what you want to find out
3232163 we have to change the mentality of these guys i dont know if its ingrained or not but we have to get the ability they have out of them
3232164 i saw a lot of enthusiasm from the younger players we had in there thats something i hope they can teach the upperclassmen you just have to play this game with enthusiasm
3232165 it was a nice way to stretch the legs of tractors had been rusting in barns for many years

3232167 we are making this strategic investment to help bring new efficient clean natural gas vehicles to the market in the united states
3232168 demand for natural gas vehicles is surging particularly with the high cost of petroleum fuel and the savings to be gained by using natural gas fuel
3232169 starting 2009 the bank is expected to utilise its recent capital increase proceeds worth egp200m to expand its loan portfolio in particular lending activities to export based small and medium enterprises
3232170 i thought we executed very well for a first scrimmage especially offensively they showed is a couple of looks we hadnt seen you really dont prepare as well as a regular season game because there arent any films or scouting reports
3232171 same thing with their offense they ran the i but they ran it in a different way than what weve seen overall i thought we did very well considering
3232172 you want to find out who can play friday nights you dont want injuries all of them will be back but it gives others a chance
3232173 you want to start building your depth now plus we came out of the scrimmage as healthy as we went in
3232174 we have a lot of work to do every coach says that after his first scrimmage but its true
3232175 its your first live competition and things get revealed that you wont see during practice for one our pass defense has to be much better well get back to work today on those areas and get better for next week
3232176 i dont know if anyone can really be ready but were excited
3232177 we learn how to use our lockers and learn around the school

3232215 he wandered through that smokey room woke up naked weeping to a scratchy old don williams or hank williams tune or was it a short story by tennessee williams the words had sound the melodies fell into words on a torn stained page he thought he was indeed a special lad but found there was no protection from the loss of love except drugged promiscuity and drunken bouts with the ever blowing sax in his mind or was it the wind sweeping over the tundra of his freeze dried heart he became an uncle to some all the while the child in him begs for sweets like frosted mini wheats sometimes the dust of rumors covered him but somehow he always managed to sneak out of the pub before he fell in with the mean or shallow or fearful in their blushing manhood the louts out to prove they were louts and stouthearted men i am a child beloved of my mother and all my dead friends he called out to the fog and dogs therein but they just saw an enigma wrapped in bacon and a sardonic wit that somehow never appeared as deep as the pint glass in front of him he walked away naked the bacon wrap sliding quite unseductively from his weary shoulders

3232218 in real life no i dont think so but in the world of pop culture and history thats where i found my heroes ill never forget the moment in star wars when i was little seeing princess leia roll her eyes at han solos rescue attempt grab the gun from him and start shooting storm troopers a moment like that you store those up as a little girl as proof the dominant culture is wrong and women can be strong
3232219 wonder woman and the original huntress were the only feminist heroes in comics when i was little but now there are so many
3232220 of course i was also always a huge batman fan and wanted to be batman above all
3232221 the original huntress was amazing because she was the daughter of batman and catwoman and had the best qualities of both characters creating a sort of healing of the psychologically split society they came from the height of the american feminist movement in 1977 you have paul levitz now the president of dc comics to thank for writing that
3232222 yes it was a dream come true to finally write comics and my pitch was a lengthy batwoman origin story
3232223 but you have to roll with the punches you have to catch your breath and say oh okay hmmm well how about and once i pitched a huntress miniseries they said they wanted to step back and do huntress year one to do the complete origin story so i got to write a favorite strong female superhero origin story anyway i got very lucky frank miller started the year one concept twenty years ago with batman year one it was an honor to help shape pretend history as i like to say
3232224 well that was funny when cliff said that i love cliff hes a brilliant artist and he did used to be the lead artist on
3232225 helena is a dark bitter stoic catholic mafia orphan raised by assassins
3232226 ive talked to other writers about working with artists who completely disregarded their wishes about creating feminist comics and i am convinced i was the luckiest writer in the world cliff was helpful kind and totally committed to drawing my vision of the huntress many artists refuse to cooperate or feel threatened by this type of feedback not cliff hes warm and mature and very interested in learning how to draw in a feminist way i really want to work with him again
3232227 i told cliff okay now no t amp a and hes brazilian and he wrote me an email back saying i so sorry but what is it this means please explain me this t amp a so i explained sexism in comic book art
3232228 i asked for no arched backs no butts sticking out no fighting poses that look like porn or sex poses and no fighting posture or body language that isnt exactly as you would draw the fighting posture or body language of a man
3232229 cliff was very accommodating and supportive but we were also under time pressure and he wasnt used to that type of art direction so we got it done
3232230 also i care about feminists more than women per se in comics and entertainment for example greg rucka is one of my favorite feminist comic book writers and was a great inspiration for getting me over to the writing side of comics and joss whedon is one my absolute heroes for buffy the vampire slayer its amazing now knowing them and seeing them at comic con im still starstruck around my heroes this year at comic con i met lindsey wagner iconic star of the seventies series bionic woman and sounded like an idiot and literally knocked something over i was so excited
3232231 oh i hope so i love huntress her history her toughness her darkness im already getting email from fans around the country saying huntress year one got them back into comics which means the world to me also the full time comics fan boys who have rated it the best miniseries of the year many of them obsessed with comics and not particularly concerned with feminism those reviews have meant a lot to me too you get a lot of feedback in comics so get ready for it if youre going to become a custodian of superhero legends the characters belong to everyone who loves them and they act like it
3232232 i heard some fans started a petition to get dc comics to have me do a monthly title which was funny because dcs not against it but the truth is that i have an eighty hour a week day job and several unpublished other writing projects id like to get published so im working with vertigo the graphic novel imprint for dc about possibly doing a literary graphic novel id love to do a huntress monthly but not right now if sales of the book version of huntress year one do well in january they might want to do one they might not and i may or may not get asked but im a dc diehard all the way and will write more huntress someday
3232233 yes thats the central reason i love comics my insane deeply personal over identification with batman i think i am batman always have from nursery school on i dont think that condition is in the pdr physicians desk reference but ive met many people who have it i wrote a one shot one issue out of continuity batman and they bought it but havent published it yet id love to write more batman
3232234 i think women especially little girls have a sense that they are one way publically but have this deep and dark secret power to be truly great to be powerful to make a difference but they have to hide it thats part of the appeal of batman and also of samantha stevens on bewitched
3232235 but with batman his day job isnt housewife its international playboy and mogul something not available to little girls
3232236 im a writer and many of my friends are writers and id started an earlier group called the red room writers society to create the kind of support and structure we needed to finish our writing projects and succeed
3232237 now i want to reach out to writers and readers on a global scale writers need websites to promote themselves and their work and a place to live their lives online where they can find readers friends colleagues and mentors thats what
3232238 sure or to contact their favorite writer through the site or to find other like minded readers to start a book group to gain greater insight into the topics or creative work they find interesting to find friends to write book reviews whatever they want but youre right many are secretly aspiring writers and we want to inspire and empower them to achieve their dreams
3232239 just as many women start their own small businesses instead of trying to make it in a male dominated larger business women are finding the internet a friendly place to self publish
3232240 search engines are filters because if your writing appears high up in a search on a topic many people must have read it linked to it and so on if you create a collective blog as youve done your ability to find peers and collaborate is a filter not every blogger can do that
3232241 it depends what your goal is if youre a writer who wants status in the mainstream writing community there are certain flaming hula hoops your poodle is supposed to jump through if you are primarily concerned with sharing information and touching peoples lives you have more options to self publish or publish online or for free
3232242 i like when i get asked this question because it makes me sound really dynamic but the truth is that i barely have time to do the one highest priority thing my job as ceo of red room my writing comes second of course i also have my relationship and family to squeeze in there but im very lucky i work with my fianc so were both at work all the time and get to be together our house is a few blocks away from the office so we dont have any commute time and ive put my other interests like singing politics and law all on hold until weve built a meaningful and enduring cultural institution over here someday im going to relax and just write for the rest of my life
3232243 there are three aspects of being a writer that i identified when i was coaching writers and i call it the red room method
3232244 my advice in general about writing whether its comics or not is to be completely vulnerable and take huge risks in writing crazy stuff and not stopping to edit until youre all done
3232245 at the end of that process when you have nothing else to say then look into editing it appropriately for whatever genre and market its best suited to
3232246 my advice about breaking into mainstream superhero comics is pragmatic and all about marketing because youre writing as a business for a genre and format that is highly structured
3232247 first read three books about how to write comics denny oneils book about how to write comics the dc way
3232248 second go to comic con or a local comic book convention and find the editors who are in charge of the books and characters you want to write and pitch them a brief one sentence elevator pitch
3232249 third write practice scripts edit them carefully with help if possible and pitch them to someone youve established a rapport with from the convention if they dont like it ask them what they do like what they do want so you nail it the next time

3232289 the petitioner appeared in person to state about the pressure on him to withdraw this writ petition
3232290 throughout its journey the petition faced a number of other hurdles at different stages initially the petition was filed through m s rana advocate of this court
3232291 subsequently d s rajput advocate appeared to make submissions the writ petition was ultimately ordered to be admitted on september 15 1995
3232292 in view of the reply filed which revealed some of the person named by the petitioner indeed had been shown as killed in encounters the court obviously would have felt the need for some proper investigation to really go into the allegations made in the petition that these were the fake encounters and thus cold blooded murders no directions however were given for fixing the case for hearing
3232293 generally the courts in such cases are requested to entrust investigation to the vigilance set up of the state on the ground that it can be expected to be free from influences

3232332 oh well as long as youre keeping productive carry on
3232333 you have to go through the hard times to know what the good times are
3232334 people universally tend to think that happiness is a stroke of luck something that will maybe descend upon you like fine weather if youre fortunate enough but thats not how happiness works happiness is the consequence of personal effort you fight for it strive for it insist upon it and sometimes even travel around the world looking for it you have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings and once you have achieved a state of happiness you must never become lax about maintaining it you must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that happiness forever to stay afloat on top of it if you dont you will leak away your innate contentment
3232335 so happiness is a state of being its a constant experimentation of different recipes at each time and the tricky part is finding the right recipe for the time of life youre at not someone elses only when the other person likes the taste of your recipe and vice versa then it will work and you start making new recipes together but not the other way round

3232359 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years

3232398 usually the first week of school is exciting with the kids and all the new things but its still kind of a struggle to get your brain off summer vacation and back into working with kids and devoting all that attention to them
3232399 what i like about working at the bank is the fact that i get a little bit of a business background so if i want to go further into maybe a masters in administration being a principal or if someday i want to leave teaching and go into the business i have a little bit of a background there
3232400 and i do love being with the kids all day but i like the adult conversations at the bank and meeting with customers and talking with them too
3232401 i was just on vacation in california with my girlfriends for a weekend getaway and there was stuff in the store that i needed for my classroom so i was shopping thats the first thing i bought was stuff for my classroom versus stuff for myself so i think about the kids all of the time

3232410 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3232411 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3232412 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3232413 auto sales have a good chance of improving over the next two years as detroit improves its mix of fuel efficient cars
3232414 satellite radio is more likely to become a standard feature in new cars due to a better product for consumers more choice and less confusion among customers over the long term
3232415 they kept each other on their toes i hope they keep their edge and dont become a fat and happy monopoly
3232416 the consumer will suffer because two competitors are better than one
3232417 when you have a monopoly it generally leads to higher prices and less innovation in terms of technology you dont have to be as scrappy when you dont have a competitor
3232418 the jury is still out on whether even one satellite radio company can survive these companies have been racking up some pretty substantial losses year in and year out
3232419 one of the arguments we made in opposing the merger was why would the government want to bail out two companies that made really bad business decisions
3232420 a lot of analysts and experts think that given the explosion of podcasting and the talk about wireless internet in the car theres a real question whether even a monopoly satellite radio provider is going to be able to survive
3232421 solid this quarter despite a retreating consumer and a higher percentage of ipod jacks in new cars giving us confidence that consumers still like the product
3232422 it is likely that churn will tend to be lower for the combined company as the a la carte offerings make the product more customizable and the increased offerings make the product more attractive
3232423 its not a big ticket item it isnt going to be that high on the list
3232424 the renegotiation of high cost contracts on sports and with major personalities such as oprah and martha stewart
3232425 based on arbitron ratings we believe xm and sirius overpaid for all their content with the possible exception of howard stern we believe the howard stern contract has been profitable but that his contract may be renewed at lower rate when it expires in 2010
3232426 i didnt go in planning to break the world record
3232427 serveraday rocks i want fridays side deal 1 or 2
3232428 the company is exploring the possibilities of acquiring the product portfolio as part of inorganic growth which is a routine on going activity of the company
3232429 the company is scouting for acquisition in us and other european countries as and when we finalize any deal acquisition we will inform to the exchange accordingly
3232430 i am also very confident the strong competencies of the aems clearing amp settlement and capital market teams will contribute to the development of atos origin and to our strategy of delivering business outcome especially for our financial services customers
3232431 furthermore this transaction provides atos origin with an increased financial flexibility to invest in its strategic development priorities such as payments and offshore and consolidate its current activity portfolio focusing on creating value for our shareholders
3232432 on behalf of the company i welcome the aems team into the nyse euronext family aems expands our portfolio of sophisticated technological solutions and expertise for the benefit of our customers and our own technology mission this transaction further consolidates our position as a global leader in providing ultra fast trading functionality and connectivity to financial services firms and exchanges around the world
3232433 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3232434 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3232435 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3232436 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3232437 clutterkiller is a great product i was able to organize my desktop within minutes it is definitely a time saver
3232438 i just found clutterkiller filed all the crap in my downloads folder in seconds was pretty amazed actually i can actually see my whole desktop now
3232439 clutterkiller is a very useful utility for identifying and removing the build up of unused files that accumulate on your pc use it to instantly organise files and folders into type just drag them into the interface and they will be instantly sorted into the correct categories
3232440 great quick cleanup isolator is underrated workes great my dad always leaves stuff on the desktop when he uses the computer the isolator isnt mentioned in the description but i use that a lot now
3232441 there is a much more polished program called clutterkiller that cleans and organizes your desktop and has some other cool functions like an isolator that blacks out wallpaper other windows and icons
3232442 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3232443 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3232444 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3232445 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3232446 its not what you want to do forever is it
3232447 inflation at a domestic level in japan is a good thing because it will bring out household savings into other investments like stocks apart from bonds and deposits
3232448 some consumers were paying thousands of dollars to be added to someones account to get a short term increase in their credit rating
3232449 im thrilled with fair isaacs willingness to take a second look at this
3232450 when you have someone as an authorized user on a credit card you give them an escape route
3232451 if you lose your job or get into a horrible financial mess youre not dragging them down with you
3232452 when i went to college i was listed on my dads credit card as an authorized user but i was strictly told it could only be used for emergency purposes and not to buy a round of beer for everybody
3232453 when its done in a family environment where the practices of sound credit are taught its very beneficial
3232454 it was very difficult and one of the things that i remembered was after i did my first screen test one executive freaked out and said please never ever ever show your stomach in public ever again never so thats why im like naked in the show all the time as youll see
3232455 television has changed a lot and also its wonderful to be working with vh1 who have been incredible in really allowing us to be ourselves which is a major problem in television when you work with an artist and you try to create a show you make a show about them they often do the wrong thing and you try to create them and make them into something else but vh1 actually allowed us to be ourselves which is really a miracle and thats why this show is so exciting

3232487 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3232488 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3232489 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3232490 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward
3232491 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
3232492 it was not an endorsement and i have no further comment
3232493 obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move our nation forward with a broadly progressive agenda
3232494 at the core are americas working families of all hues and ethnicities whose determination to move forward does not depend on and will not be diverted by the daily twists and turns of this watershed presidential campaign they are taking the long view
3232495 if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term
3232496 endorse and join in the anti bush anti right wing sentiments that are driving so many people to activism
3232497 the communist party usa views the 2008 elections as a tremendous opportunity to defeat the policies of the right wing republicans and to move our country in a new progressive direction
3232498 we will work with others to defeat the republican nominee and to end right wing control of the new congress

3232526 the best time to watch regardless of your location is from 2 a m to dawn local time but the best seats will be in the western half of north america where dark skies coincide with the peak activity the perseids get their name from the constellation perseus from which they tend to emanate like spokes from the hub of a wheel the meteors can make their appearance anywhere in the sky however

3232541 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
3232542 the evidence is incontrovertible global warming is occurring if no mitigating actions are taken significant disruptions in the earths physical and ecological systems social systems security and human health are likely to occur we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now
3232543 because the complexity of the climate makes accurate prediction difficult the aps urges an enhanced effort to understand the effects of human activity on the earths climate and to provide the technological options for meeting the climate challenge in the near and longer terms the aps also urges governments universities national laboratories and its membership to support policies and actions that will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases
3232544 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3232545 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3232546 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
3232547 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
3232548 this is a challenge for climate modelers we dont fully understand it
3232549 if we knew the answer to things like this one would have more confidence
3232550 the whole notion that something outside has to cause a change is absurd
3232551 weve looked at the sun volcanoes are not doing anything weird the oceans can dump heat into the atmosphere but theyre getting warmer too
3232552 rather than engage speech that strays too far from the dangerously narrow borders of our public discourse the gatekeepers of that discourse our mass media tend to effectively shout it down marginalize it or ignore it
3232553 after several years of stumbling mainstream science and environmental coverage has generally adopted the scientific consensus that increases in heat trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels and tropical deforestation are changing the planets climate causing adverse effects even more rapidly than had been predicted
3232554 a danger that the subtleties of the science and its uncertainty might be missed by reporters unfamiliar with the territory
3232555 scientists look for consistency among several reports before concluding something is true
3232556 we dont regard this new fewer hurricane report as the last word on this topic
3232557 a meteorologist at cbss chicago station did a special report that featured local scientists discussing the hazards of global warming in one segment well known national skeptics in another and ended with a cop out what is the truth about global warming
3232558 he said she said but he or she is wrong and here is the correct way to think
3232559 the era of equal time for skeptics who argue that global warming is just a result of natural variation and not human intervention seems to be largely over except on talk radio cable and local television
3232560 deep sea temperatures warmed about 1 300 years before the tropical surface ocean and well before the rise in atmospheric co2
3232561 suggests the rise in greenhouse gas was likely a result of warming
3232562 the co increase lagged antarctic deglacial warming by 800 200 years and preceded the northern hemisphere deglaciation
3232563 significantly changes the planets distance from the sun during its long year which lasts 248 earth years
3232564 in the midst of a global change that can modify temperatures by as much as 10 degrees fahrenheit
3232565 global warming has finally been explained the earth is getting hotter because the sun is burning more brightly than at any time during the past 1 000 years according to new research
3232566 suggests that increasing radiation from the sun is responsible for recent global climate changes
3232567 is brighter than it was a few hundred years ago and this brightening started relatively recently in the last 100 to 150 years
3232568 simultaneous warming on earth and mars suggests that our planets recent climate changes have a natural and not a human induced cause
3232569 habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at st petersburgs pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia says the mars data is evidence that the current global warming on earth is being caused by changes in the sun
3232570 changes in the suns heat output can account for almost all the climate changes we see on both planets
3232571 similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period
3232572 suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena
3232573 some planetary climate changes may be due to variations in the solar system environment
3232574 its very disturbing that we do not understand the climate on a planet that is so much like the earth
3232575 it is telling us that we really dont understand the earth we have ended up with a lot of mysteries
3232576 thick atmosphere traps solar radiation and heats the world to boiling point
3232577 carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans where it forms carbonate minerals and over the millennia is deposited as rock
3232578 a study of sea temperature changes predicts a lull as traditional climate cycles cancel out the heating effect of greenhouse gases from pollution
3232579 global warming will be put on hold over the next decade because of natural climate variations
3232580 snow cover over north america and much of siberia mongolia and china is greater than at any time since 1966
3232581 that there is anthropological and geological evidence of much greater melts in the past
3232582 climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of manmade warming on polar ice melt
3232583 as a result of the cold la nina current in the pacific
3232584 its a really bad thing for a scientist to have an immovable intractable position
3232585 the oceans have not warmed up at all over the past four or five years that could mean global warming has taken a breather
3232586 the oceans are what really matter when it comes to global warming
3232587 in the past 70 years the sun was more active than at almost any other time in the last 11 400 years
3232588 global warming and other environmental insults were threatening the planet with catastrophe
3232589 the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming follows from the burning of fossil fuels and requires immediate action
3232590 1 500 clergy theologians religious leaders scientists academics and policy experts concerned about the harm that kyoto could inflict on the worlds poor
3232591 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments of the earth
3232592 when politicians and journalists declare that the science of global warming is settled they show a regrettable ignorance about how science works
3232593 climate research became politicized in favour of one particular hypothesis
3232594 often imagine that anyone who doubts the hypothesis of man made global warming must be in the pay of the oil companies as a result some key discoveries in climate research go almost unreported
3232595 cloudiness varies according to how many atomic particles are coming in from exploded stars
3232596 the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin
3232597 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
3232598 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
3232599 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

3232601 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

3232610 the main concern is the economy and the steep fall in demand
3232611 it seems that the weakness in the us economy has now spread to europe and asia and i think thats what the main concern is
3232612 investors have to realize that if the situation escalates the shutdown in the ports could last a long time and this could start affecting supplies
3232613 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture

3232625 we hope it makes a wonderful difference for our students
3232626 prepare our staff to deliver an updated more rigorous curriculum and develop closer relationships with students
3232627 i cant bring myself to walk the aisles of the supermarket there is such an abundance of everything even pet food i cant handle the contrast
3232628 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3232629 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3232630 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3232631 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3232632 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3232633 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3232634 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3232635 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3232636 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3232637 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3232638 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3232639 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3232640 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3232641 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
3232642 le plus hallucinant ce sont les trois trousses et les six cahiers de dessin attaque val rie je ne pensais pas que d s le cp on leur demandait autant de mat riel
3232643 pour la colle cest pareil on me dit que la ma tresse a une exigence pas de colle b ton elle pr f re une colle roulette dont la marque est cit e mais bon cest une super marque et du coup la colle est 4 50 euros

3232647 the beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you
3232648 usually im not at a loss for words but this has really gotten to me the enormity of isaacs contributions are almost too much to try and reflect upon he was one of the key architects of the stax sound the memphis sound the legacy that stax is recognized for today all the things that have made that music so indelible for so many generations isaac has to be credited with much of that
3232649 he was an innovator a musical genius and he had a mind that was ever searching for better ways to do things musically at stax he was viewed as the epitome of what everybody wanted to be
3232650 as a creative force he was revolutionary and personally ive lost a big part of me with him
3232651 we initially got together to try and emulate the success of songwriting teams like holland dozier holland and bacharach and david
3232652 one thing we noticed about those accomplished collaborators is they seemed to have consistency so from the beginning we worked to try and find that
3232653 everybody wanted to see what we were going to come out with next
3232654 because the creative juices were coming from a special place when we worked together
3232655 the first time i saw isaac he was wearing pink socks green pants and a yellow flowered shirt and he was completely bald
3232656 i thought oh my god who is this guy but man what songs he wrote for us
3232657 like rock groups i always wanted to present songs as dramas it was something white artists did so well but black folks hadnt got into
3232658 which was why i picked those if you like white songs for that set because they had that dramatic content and i knew it would work too
3232659 when it hit so big i was in severe disbelief
3232660 i walked around thinking did i really do that then when it won an academy award i was in a state of shock
3232661 when my agent told me i had a job doing a voice over i thought it was for disney
3232662 but when i read the script it was really funny i remember saying i hope you guys got insurance because youre going to get sued the more i did it the more fun i had but at the beginning of south park i thought that id ruined my career
3232663 were celebrating our 15th anniversary this year certainly well turn this one into a celebration of his life he has been incredibly important to the whole re acceptance of memphis music here he is one of our great legends
3232664 the commitment that we had made to each other many many years ago before we ever had any success was that if need be we would always be there for each other
3232665 when i used to pick cotton in the fields as a little kid i was always looking back to see if i got cotton in my sack and she said stop
3232666 so i was picking picking picking and then it felt like someone was standing on my sack i looked back my sack is full
3232667 i always keep my head down working doing things moving forward thats what ive done all my life
3232668 see nikolai thats toby he was the baby in labyrinth
3232669 mommy so they really did turn toby into a goblin
3232670 im just like the others baby we are all the same
3232671 i am just like the others but the ending is never the same
3232672 give it at least a year id bet you guys are gonna become famous
3232673 sometimes you have to throw some mexican judo in there as in ju dont know who youre messin with holmes
3232674 provides for the exemption from federal income tax of organizations organized and operated exclusively for charitable or educational purposes no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda or otherwise attempting to influence legislation
3232675 dad i saw the tila tequila show shes my role model
3232676 you know what theres a lot of good stuff on tv
3232677 you know what kids are drinking less doing less drugs and having less unprotected sex than they used to wow somethings going right
3232678 senator obama is claiming putting air in your tires is the equivalent of new offshore drilling
3232679 thats not an energy plan my friends thats a public service announcement
3232680 the continuous decline of the cpi is a positive sign as it shows the governments measures to ease inflationary pressures were effective
3232681 look one of my deepest wishes is that i might get a chance to have sex one more time before i die beta blockers and thiazide water pills arent gonna let that happen id rather blow a gasket
3232682 look dont get upset but i think all men cheat some just dont get caught
3232683 remember what the l rd your g d did unto miriam by the way as you came forth out of egypt
3232684 one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin
3232685 you shall not take vengeance or bear any grudge against the children of your people
3232686 you shall rebuke your neighbor and you shall not bear sin because of him
3232687 you shall not act similar to korach and his company
3232688 to him and by implication his wise ones shall you cleave
3232689 give us your money and well be your friend and main ways of hunger
3232690 in the 80s cocaine and other narcotics were addictions along with alcoholism yes im aware that its still rampant but one form of addiction starts when were kids cartoons use to sell poison known as fructose fat and death theyre called fast food and they will ploy there evil ways at toddlers and set places for people who came from poor environments such as myself once they have you theyll wrap you in an enigma of lies racial empowerment and atlast obesity slavery for people like me who are 300 pounds it becomes harder everday but one day at a time i try to take it
3232691 what makes you think that this would be any different
3232692 can you trust what you see on the other side of the mirror
3232693 well damn i did but now that you say something about it
3232694 this just in those who have just eaten are less likely to claim that they are hungry
3232695 you really need to know why youre adopting these technologies
3232696 you cant just leap in every time a new thing gets hyped
3232697 one day it will be as simple to use as electricity and you just plug it in
3232698 a lot of the hype will be around the promise that has been held out for a very simple to use flexible approach to information technology and the reality of achieving that is going to be out of line
3232699 whenever you try to achieve one of these big dreams its inevitably harder to get there than you think and it takes longer to get there than people tend to think
3232700 i think the quality of the experience that these systems have brought is very attractive and it does start to introduce an element of feeling that you are at least partially there
3232701 that has been missing in previous generations of the technology
3232702 they will go to the actual facebook or myspace route and say yep we want to bring it in and well figure out what the problems are once we do that
3232703 you have this peripheral vision of whats happening around you that a lot of the more point to point collaboration tools dont give you
3232704 they are willing to put up with the unknowns that you get when you get popular consumer technologies into the enterprise
3232705 buddy dont do it that butch goring has the fans clapping i think she picked it up in paul kariya
3232706 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law
3232707 the cumulative impact of these changes equals a full blown attack on americas premier conservation law please email secretary of the interior dirk kempthorne and make sure he knows that the american people will not stand for any attempts to weaken the endangered species act
3232708 the united nations has observed that russian troops had entered into areas of georgia outside of south ossetia and abkhazia
3232709 would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on august the 6th
3232710 no legitimate russian interests can justify the magnitude of the attack
3232711 an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of august 6th and a commitment to refrain from using force
3232712 ning n ojo ha visto ning n o do ha escuchado ninguna mente humana ha concebido lo que dios ha preparado para quienes lo aman
3232713 im just trying to do my thing now girl i love you i hope all is good with you i love you babygirl
3232714 i wish i still had that old 286 computer were intermingled with internet research
3232715 outdoor place for me to sell you my crap and vice versa
3232716 it will still be louisiana cajun creole stuff but with a little more flair to it
3232717 it will still be louisiana cajun creole stuff but with a little more flair to it
3232718 where is rodney dangerfield when we need him there are some heated
3232719 this means the considerable amount of online gt gt gt video available to other users is out of reach of the linux crowd
3232720 you wonder why theyd want to kiss off 2 3 gt gt gt of the desktops
3232721 it has the potential to be one of the top events of the games
3232722 i think the sport needs it so hopefully it materializes into what it has the potential to be
3232723 well find out more as that competition gets under way and we start to see the early rounds and see what kind of shape tyson gay is in and where everyone else is
3232724 i still think hes a better 200 meter runner than 100 meter runner
3232725 hes already proved that he did bounce back and ran the fastest time in the world this year
3232726 jeremy has matured a lot over the years since he won in the last olympics
3232727 i think jeremys a lot further along than i was at this point because he learned the event a lot quicker than i was able to with me doubling back from 200 to 400
3232728 saxophone player buddy leach has never been to a wwe event live ive been saying once we have a night off were going to attend one ive been saying that for 15 years but tonight we finally got a chance to
3232729 im thrilled to be here im looking forward to witnessing a lot of fun tonight
3232730 i picked up a lot of show business tips by attending wrestling events for instance how to work a crowd sports entertainment is a real slice of americana
3232731 in one episode her character walks upstairs never to return or to be mentioned again
3232732 john 14 6 were not uttered at angry religious leaders or directed at the lost and downtrodden his eminent line was spoken that day to those who knew him best
3232733 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3232734 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
3232735 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did
3232736 we expect the markets for worley parsons services will remain strong
3232737 our key markets and sectors continue to experience positive conditions and we are well positioned to respond to these opportunities
3232738 subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009
3232739 spectrum have worked closely with the us department of homeland security and the transportation security administration and are delivering products and solutions to the market now the r amp d pipeline is expected to yield a steady stream of new products to improve security for travellers at border crossings public buildings hospitals prisons stadiums auditoriums and transportation hubs
3232740 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
3232741 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
3232742 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
3232743 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
3232744 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
3232745 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
3232746 right now weve already got a camera working it works very well with computers its just how to connect the camera to the brain that is the issue to be solved
3232747 can luke overcome his vain prejudice can jeris allow her tender heart to trust again will they let god show them the heart of the matter
3232748 the extent of the impact fuel prices are having on our business was underlined when we announced a loss of 663 million hong kong dollars 84 89 million us dollars in our interim results last week
3232749 while we are reducing services on some routes we will continue to maintain the integrity of our network reshaping it where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money
3232750 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew park was going to have a good last 50 metres so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100m to 150m
3232751 i was in really good shape but phelps swam so fast
3232752 it means a lot to win my first individual medal and on a stage like this it is awesome
3232753 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3232754 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
3232755 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
3232756 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
3232757 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3232758 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3232759 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
3232760 but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
3232761 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
3232762 this is not the time to remove interest deductibility on foreign investments even if it only applies to double dips
3232763 the foreign country deduction has no impact on canadian tax revenues and is arguably of benefit since it increases the amount of after tax income available to be returned to canada
3232764 canadian firms need at the very least a level playing field for investment abroad if they are to take full advantage of global value chains and foreign affiliates
3232765 this should be the key guiding principle for all reform of international business taxation
3232766 im ever hopeful that governments can be convinced to do the right thing by good analysis
3232767 we scaled down the number of units for more green space and a pond instead of squeezing in as much as we could
3232768 this has been the result of many months of planning with lots of input from lots of professionals
3232769 canon is leading the way and reversing an industry wide trend by bringing manufacturing back to the united states
3232770 i really need to go see this thing for myself
3232771 i told you about all this werent you listening to me
3232772 i told you about all this werent you listening to me
3232773 im just glad im not the oldest cat around here anymore
3232774 i think the fans are pretty excited about the moves weve made and as a team we just have to stay focused and realize one guy cant come in change the whole season
3232775 we still have to keep busting our butt and keep working
3232776 we were in the weightroom and i was joking around with him about the weight he had hes like oh no if its not over 100 pounds then im not doing it
3232777 i know the terminology that he came out of and i understand its a challenge with this system
3232778 football is football and xs and os are the same but its just the language and the terminology if i can shed some light on things that are similar then it helps him out a lot
3232779 its the biggest thing the language hes so smart that he can look at a play and say oh this is this play but its something we call differently here
3232780 he is a very smart guy and hell pick this thing up real real quick and ill probably be asking him for help on certain things
3232781 you knew at any point in time when you were playing him regardless of the score or regardless of the situation that they were always in the football game
3232782 during the off season and training camp is where you build the chemistry of your team
3232783 i like the guys im working with and the biggest thing is relationships because we enjoy going to work together and we enjoy working hard
3232784 to call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him down there and get him to work
3232785 he is the last person i would want to have to deal with this problem
3232786 every developer i talk to we make a pitch about incorporating residences
3232787 compared to 10 years ago downtown is very attractive for development
3232788 our charge is to help plan for the next 10 years to update a collective vision prioritize selective enhancements and promote smart growth
3232789 you dont want people to come downtown for one experience
3232790 you want them to be able to enjoy an entire day or evening
3232791 downtowns need a critical mass of housing and you could liken it to the chicken and the egg riddle
3232792 if a person spends their life screwing it up can they make a name for themself
3232793 a person can do as they please it may not be the best thing either but god is still there he still loves them for everything they are he will never give up on them it doesnt mean he wont be disappointed though
3232794 now this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
3232795 y sta es la vida eterna que te conozcan a ti el nico dios verdadero y a jesucristo a quien t has enviado
3232796 the president will provide a statement in the rose garden at 5 15 p m today
3232797 the president has been getting regular updates on the situation in georgia he got one this morning in his intel brief and got some throughout the day as he was at the events
3232798 this afternoon at about 1 50 p m edt he spoke with his national security adviser stephen hadley and he got a comprehensive briefing on the situation we are continuously working to gather facts and analyzing facts on the ground
3232799 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3232800 in escalating the conflict through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside south ossetia russia has ceased to act as a peacekeeper it is imperative that russia respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3232801 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tbilisi
3232802 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3232803 saakashvili says the russians are bent on regime change in very emotional language he claimed the russians were engaged in ethnic cleansing
3232804 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3232805 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3232806 first of all we are losing foreign investment because of the security situation
3232807 those who pay bribes will be successful will get land will get access to electricity
3232808 those who do not know how to bribe will fall behind
3232809 i dont expect famine but i expect quite significant shortages of food unless the government purchases some significant amounts of food
3232810 donor countries must also address this more than anything else because it will destabilize the government and it will destabilize the current status quo
3232811 google is and will be and always has been vulnerable they havent been open with consumers ultimately this all comes down the the fact that they just want to track you guys
3232812 we will no longer offer our product to wholesalers or third party distributors in the u s
3232813 weve been selling direct to retailers in canada and other territories for years we feel its in our best interest and the best interest of the retailers to do business this way
3232814 we just feel we can do a little better because of our product knowledge and our ability to provide incentives to the retailers its a reaction to the business climate its not done with malice and its not a knee jerk thing
3232815 one of the core strengths of pure play is our variety of product lines
3232816 weve been very selective with the studios weve signed up and weve tried to structure our catalog so that the different lines are noncompeting the idea is to offer more to the retailer it shouldnt be all about price
3232817 a fair amount but not so many that we dont know what were selling
3232818 weve invested a fair amount of money to make this happen
3232819 weve upgraded our server to handle more accounts and were trying to use a lot of technology to do things better for retail customers the old method was flawed because a wholesaler that carries 1 000 titles a month cant stock our entire product line it was a cumbersome system for stores to re order our titles now were carrying the inventory which speeds up the process
3232820 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
3232821 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
3232822 in bangladesh a quiet revolution war on rampant graft brings pain promises
3232823 a nation long plagued by natural disasters poverty corruption and violence may finally be on the verge of a happier future
3232824 i wasnt planning on entering the contest i was just going to hang out with my friends by the pool so i wasnt even dressed up
3232825 but when i got pulled up on stage by my fans i thought what the heck i certainly didnt expect to win but im so happy that i did a large component of the judging points were based on fan response amp i have the best fans in the world so i really want to thank everyone who was there for me
3232826 i cant wait to kick off the new college year and what better way than hanging out with hundreds of my friends and fans at blue moon nights
3232827 my homie porno dan and i will be on the red carpet interviewing all the porn stars from nine until 11 so you know we are going to be in the mood to do one thing after that drink any team of five that wants to bring their a game to blue moon bring it in dont sing it
3232828 we have a special treat in store not only will fans get to pound beers with penny and rest of the pornstars but team flame spiritual adviser and legendary club dj airek has agreed to end his self imposed exile from the music world and to spin one last time
3232829 we want to give back to you our fans and friends so we got the owner to make this a free party for everyone attire is as casual sexy wild or as wacky as you want to be just be there
3232830 i am thrilled to be coming out to vegas to meet the movers and shakers in the music industry with a i studios writing songs and working on my album and its a very exciting time in my career right now my backup band alter image really rocks hard and we are getting pumped to tour
3232831 superstar heidi mayne hosting the official amplify music festival after party
3232832 im excited they called me to come out to this special event
3232833 mom would love this movie this would be the perfect movie for us to see together
3232834 one year the real reason i didnt blog this earlier
3232835 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3232836 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3232837 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3232838 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3232839 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3232840 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3232841 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3232842 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3232843 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3232844 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the grey whale
3232845 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3232846 it was a good day for the kiwi team for sure
3232847 but going on their past records they should be performing like that theyre top in the world
3232848 im confident i can do that and when i get there it can be anyones this is the olympics everyones on their a game
3232849 im hoping that in the semi final this time we will be one of the crews dictating terms to everyone else rather than trying to respond as we were four years ago
3232850 i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get many things that are so smart
3232851 the dark knight is like a ferrari engine of storytelling and scriptwriting and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie

3232854 gandhi believed in serving humanity and seva bharati is also doing the same
3232855 any award named after mahatma gandhi should only be conferred on an institution or a person dedicated to gandhian principles but the award conferred on an organisation allied to the rss raises doubts on the intentions of the government already working on saffron agenda it is an insult to gandhi
3232856 it was unfortunate and biggest injustice done by this government in the name of gandhi it was also a direct attack on gandhian principles

3232873 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3232874 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3232893 en las playas hay un aumento de la basura y a diferencia de lo que ocurre con las calles s hay un aumento de personal se contratan alrededor de 70 personas que se distribuyen en varios turnos las contrataciones de playas siempre son a mayores

3232897 si no somos capaces de eliminarlos tampoco tenemos mucho que hacer en la uefa
3232898 no quiero ir a la uefa para visitar europa sino para hacer algo importante y si no somos capaces de eliminar a este equipo nos dedicamos a la liga y a la copa no pasa nada
3232899 habl con franga despu s del partido y l me dice que es un buen equipo que a pesar del 3 0 el resultado fue enga oso porque en el primer tiempo se pusieron perdiendo 1 0 de penalti pero en el segundo tiempo dominaron el partido y en dos contras les hicieron los dos goles
3232900 dicen que es un buen equipo y como todos los de estas ligas vienen a espa a y para ellos es el partido
3232901 dentro de las posibilidades que hab a el hajduk seguramente sea el rival m s dif cil
3232902 el pa s ha estado en la eurocopa su nombre nos suena y la liga en la que juega es conocida pero si no somos capaces de eliminarlo tampoco tenemos mucho que hacer en la uefa
3232903 los buenos jugadores o los que yo creo que son los mejores van a estar en el campo si entramos en la uefa vamos a tener muchos partidos y que uno se quede en el banquillo en el primero no quiere decir que sea suplente

3232917 los descuentos de este a o fueron muy superiores a los de otras temporadas y eso provoc que sobre todo al principio s se notase m s afluencia de personas y un ligero aumento en el volumen de ventas
3232918 nos encontramos en un momento de desaceleraci n de la demanda la econom a va mal y nosotros somos un sector que lo sufrimos especialmente los tipos de inter s han subido los recibos del agua de la luz y del gas tambi n pero los salarios siguen siendo similares y la gente s lo compra lo necesario

3232921 hemos hablado con nieves v zquez edil de medio ambiente para comunicarle nuestro malestar por ciertos comportamientos de algunos comercios de hosteler a respecto a la limpieza muchos no respetan los horarios en lo que concierne al uso de contenedores y causan problemas porque la basura que m s molesta es la org nica que es la que ellos tienen
3232922 porque los que est n fuera afean mucho la zona centro de la ciudad
3232923 hay varios aspectos que se deben mejorar como los puntos verdes y la recogida de pilas
3232924 contamos con dos puntos verdes y la verdad es que est n muy saturados
3232925 habr a que incrementar el n mero de contenedores porque son bastante dif ciles de encontrar para los vecinos
3232926 llevamos tres semanas sin botell n y se nota que las cosas han cambiado bastante pero seguimos teniendo cosas que hay que mejorar por ejemplo los contenedores de papel y vidrio de la plaza de azc rraga se recogen cuando est n hasta los topes
3232927 los puestos de alimentaci n dejan el pavimento lleno de grasa el ayuntamiento deber a obligarles a poner una superficie entre el puesto y el empedrado para evitar esto porque es muy desagradable e incluso peligroso
3232928 en un estado que deja mucho que desear debido a las pintadas el vandalismo la falta de limpieza y los olores
3232929 est n en un estado de conservaci n lamentable porque deber an considerarse zonas saturadas debido a los ruidos y la suciedad que nos afecta durante toda la semana
3232930 esa medida ayudar a tambi n al comercio porque da muy mala imagen que la gente est comiendo en las terrazas y la basura est acumulada durante todo el d a al lado de los contenedores
3232931 hay que poner m s medios sobre todo en verano porque lo que se est n ahorrando en la limpieza de la plaza del humor hay que invertirlo en mejorar otras cosas
3232932 tenemos muchos problemas en la recogida de basuras y limpieza de calles por eso hemos exigido al ayuntamiento un parque de limpieza como los que tienen otros barrios
3232933 el problema de a zapateira es que contamos con varios servicios de recogida a coru a culleredo y arteixo debido a nuestra situaci n lo cu l es muy ca tico
3232934 lo m s importante es que vengan a limpiar los contenedores m s a menudo aunque la verdad es que a nosotros nos tratan bastante bien
3232935 no es mala pero nosotros necesitamos que vengan a limpiar la maleza de las calles porque ensucia muchos las aceras y dificulta el paso de la gente
3232936 be nice to everyone for we are all facing battles

3232946 personalising content and delivering relevant advertising online will only succeed for consumers and for advertisers if it is done in a trustworthy and transparent manner in addition business and government will need to offer approaches that recognise that at certain times personalisation and data use will be welcomed and in other cases users will demand limits on the use of their data

3232953 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
3232954 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
3232955 our business model has been highly successful and we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and as our company continues to evolve
3232956 however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
3232957 but whose rapid sales growth has cooled in recent years the lower earnings are also a sign that the sagging economy is causing even consumers in higher income brackets to pare spending

3232960 chronic procrastination is now so serious a condition it needs to be recognized by clinicians
3232961 it encourages depression lowers self esteem causes insomnia and indirectly affects health by discouraging visits to the dentist or doctor sufferers are also more likely to have accidents at home involving unmended appliances
3232962 that little chime that rings when an email message arrives says research from calgary university causes a 0 5 percent drop in the gross domestic product here in the united states costing the country 70 billion a year as employees are distracted from the task theyre supposed to be focused on
3232963 the key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely nothing
3232964 procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing they do marginally useful things like gardening or sharpening pencils or making a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around to it

3232970 strong economic fundamentals including ample foreign reserves prudent monetary and fiscal policy and wide ranging financial sector reforms that has lead to a strengthened banking sector that today is both liquid and solvent
3232971 higher arms spending than planned can also endanger the governments budgetary consolidation objectives

3233036 with a lot of guys down weve got to take a lot of reps to me i dont think of it as a bad thing because the more reps the better
3233037 but we need to add to the bottom of the roster theres a number of things we need to look at we need to improve our depth and our competition on this roster
3233038 its a fresh new start hes here well work hard with him
3233039 last year the government announced that it is committed to developing a national landscape strategy this is a further step in making that happen the heritage council has been actively promoting the introduction of landscape management plans for many years and we are particularly pleased that john gormley t d minister for the environment heritage and local government is supporting this plan and is committed to the introduction of a landscape management strategy landscape management is about accommodating change and development it provides a much more holistic approach than the current model to planning how we manage and develop the landscape where we live it enables local communities to play an essential role in the managing their own area and has been very successful when introduced in other european countries this project is about finding a successful model that can be applied to special landscapes across the country and i am particularly pleased that the first test project is located in the tara skryne landscape another pilot is planned for the burren and we hope to make an announcement of the commencement of that project in the near future
3233040 with or without the new motorway the tara skryne landscape is very special and it deserves special attention to ensure that future decisions and changes are made using the best tools available people have conflicting interests and views on how the land we inhabit is used all views are equally valid and this project is designed to bring conflicting views and interests together along with planning and environmental legislation and agree a plan for the landscape going forward that resolves conflicting interests or allows them to exist in a way that brings economic social and environmental benefits for landowners residents and visitors alike this is a challenging and potentially very rewarding project it is the first time it has been tried in ireland and we want all stakeholders with an interest in this landscape to take part in the development of this plan further announcements will be made in the autumn when the public consultation phase commences and we look forward to and welcome extensive public participation and debate in the development of this plan
3233041 we are looking forward to working with the heritage council on this project and progressing the policy in the county development plan
3233042 the heritage council has been actively promoting the introduction of landscape management plans for many years
3233043 it is obvious that during the road design process consideration was given to tara and cultural heritage however given the international significance of tara it is a matter of debate if sufficient weighting was placed upon heritage in the matrix of criteria used to inform the decision making process survey work in 2004 undertaken by landsdowne market research on behalf of the heritage council has identified a distinct shift in public attitude towards increased heritage protection and the levels of awareness of its importance to all income groups and nationwide the survey can be benchmarked against a similar survey carried out in 1999 this is a shift in public attitudes we may all do well to heed and it may well be asked if we are handing tara on to future generations in a better condition than we inherited it
3233044 these limited protections only confirm the fact that the m3 should never have been built in this landscape in the first place its like using a band aid to fix a broken nose
3233045 the heritage council proposed landscape protection measures six years ago in 2002 before the m3 was approved in 2003 and they were ignored until now
3233046 the m3 toll road should be re routed or scrapped and the tara section should become a heritage trail which would be much more profitable and give some real protections to the most important landscape in ireland
3233047 i have a feeling thats not what you dream about as a kid going through two a days
3233048 its amazing we didnt have more health issues back then with the length of practice conditioning in both practices and not giving anybody water it was crazy
3233049 its just a little different today and i think its for the better two a days dont really float my boat i think were better off when were going one practice a day
3233050 but im so happy that i get to be around these guys for one more year its really a blessing im really fortunate that ive got an extra year
3233051 even though there are mornings and days i dont feel so good im just really glad to be out here still
3233052 the good thing is the coaches are kind of letting me pace myself
3233053 im trying to get all the work i need to get but i kind of learned last year that if i get too much work i really start going down my leg starts getting pretty weak and im not a very good player
3233054 so hopefully ill know what im doing and well get to baylor and get things done
3233055 matt robinson looked like the old matt robinson which was a lot of fun
3233056 i think our young guys who came in they havent seen a lot of matt they were pretty amazed with his scrimmage the other night
3233057 he was all over the field and looked like he was having fun he actually looked like a young guy out there bouncing around for grandpa to be out there bouncing around like that was pretty impressive
3233058 the only thing most people around here know how to do is grow sugar and play football
3233059 it will survive but no one knows what will be left of it
3233060 i think its going to have a really big effect around here
3233061 theres nothing really to do besides work for sugar companies and play football here i dont have to worry about it but them little kids coming up will
3233062 theyve given lots of financial support to all the schools over the years
3233063 id like to think were going to find someone else to support our program but there isnt anyone else out here
3233064 i thought riley made some poor decisions early in the scrimmage i thought we at times got lined up wrong i thought at times we werent very physical and didnt have a lot of consistency from one play to the next
3233065 were still in the stage right now where were talking about different things but havent really made any hard fast decisions yet
3233066 its good to get school behind us now and have a couple of weeks where we can just focus on playing football grobe said
3233067 i liked n c state because of the way they stayed on me
3233068 i just talked to a couple of people in my family about it and decided that it was time
3233069 its my size that makes me a good wide receiver
3233070 its the way i play the position that helps me catch passes
3233071 somehow or another hes got to get himself well and get back out there
3233072 anytime you cant practice youve got to learn twice as much
3233073 i cant think of where we needed to avoid injuries more than this one
3233074 i really liked the leadership and demeanor billy showed in the spring but he didnt take anything for granted at that point
3233075 offensively weve had a difficult time trying to run the ball against them
3233076 theres a lot of talent and a lot of competition and those are two ingredients for a very good line
3233077 we have a strong quick competitive line finally we are at a point where we are going up its not a huge learning curve anymore people are sharpening their skills working on the details and practicing hard
3233078 im running better moving better its made a huge difference its paying dividends
3233079 its amazing how it turned around for the line over the summer theres some buzz out there but we need to focus on getting better
3233080 it was just the empty space under the power lines nothing was growing there but it was our playground
3233081 i guess thats where everything started for gio its like one of those movies going from there to the big leagues
3233082 he went from nothing to this its hard to believe it we played with tires and cardboard for bases threw them down under the big electrical poles if you hit it left or right youd hit a window and youd be out so we all learned to hit it up the middle if we had a rock to hit and a broomstick to swing we were playing
3233083 i remember he threw it once in khoury league youth baseball and you could see the ball bite straight down from center field
3233084 everyone said thats it never mind there was no way anyone could hit it
3233085 i remember throwing the curveball to my cousin and it started at his face and almost hit him in the foot
3233086 he dropped his glove and said forget it i dont want to catch
3233087 im telling you i cant wait to put on that white uniform
3233088 wherever i go home i get a warm welcome from everyone
3233089 they treat me special but not because im a baseball player but they know me they know my personality they know ill talk to anyone
3233090 he can meet you today and he wants to try to help you theres a bum in hialeah and gio is his best friend everyone who sees him has to give him money and food because of gio he goes over and above
3233091 whatevers in my pockets whatever is in the car i can have 10 bucks and be starving but i think well i have a home i can go to so i give it to him
3233092 ive told everyone if they pass joe under the bridge at 103rd make sure to give him money or food or books because he loves to read
3233093 i dont know anyone in naples my friends are here in this block my aunt is in the next block everyone here has helped me this is my support
3233094 but the oakland as are proud of having them be a part of team usa
3233095 the experience they get over there will be worth it pitching in that environment in high pressure situations will be great for kids development
3233096 hes grown into his body and his confidence has jumped his body language looks like he belongs in the big leagues brett also carries himself with a ton of confidence and his command is phenomenal he can place his fastball where he wants and he competes hes got some bulldog in him
3233097 of course youd want to play for your country but its even better to get a opportunity to play in the big leagues
3233098 we have an offday at home and maybe we can relax and get away from baseball
3233099 come back with a little revived spirit on tuesday and get back on track
3233100 but weve got to start swinging the bats better thats the main thing
3233101 id say as far as being out of sync it probably was
3233102 this is probably one of the best days in camp
3233103 we were making the right calls adjustments and breaking on the ball
3233104 he took me under his wing and taught me how to be a professional and how to be a student of the game
3233105 were going to get together and everything ive learned over my years im going to help him take his game to another level

3233110 mit 21 prozent der stimmen den zweiten platz hinter den usa die politische stabilit t und die starke technologieszene in deutschland gaben hier den ausschlag
3233111 a wedding is political and there are lots of cooks in the kitchen now
3233112 it would be handy to have a little cheat sheet that clearly stated refer these cases with this info
3233113 we can assume a couple of those plays over the last couple of weeks wouldve been touchdowns
3233114 when he gets the ball in his hands in the open field i think theres always a chance
3233115 were going to use a number of running backs and the starter as far as im concerned will be the guy who plays the first play in the game not because one has earned the privilege to start over another it will be based on what we decide to do as an offensive staff to start the game
3233116 obviously were going to have two players and as i look at it its going to be lendale and its going to be chris were going to change them out throughout the game and back them up
3233117 were working to try to create a situation offensively where we get to raise the stress factors on defense
3233118 you have to put players in position to create mismatches thats what were working for
3233119 i just wanted to come in here and see how well i could do in my first nfl game and just have a good game and let the whole organization know that the titans didnt make a mistake on me making me a first round pick
3233120 he could be the very best road course driver ive ever seen
3233121 it all worked out we came out third so im happy and tickled to death
3233122 i kept watching his lap times and they didnt fall off in a long run like a lot of the cars did
3233123 he stayed consistent and kept the car under him all day we looked at the tires the first stop and at that point i figured it was going to be a pretty good day if everything fell our way from there on out
3233124 anytime you can finish in the top five in this series youre doing your job and certainly itll help us in the future
3233125 i think this is our first top five in a long time
3233126 we ran well last week at pocono and we had a good car at sonoma too sometimes things will fall into place for you
3233127 we came up out of the truck so well we were too scared to change anything and the car was flopping around a lot during the race though it had a lot of grip
3233128 it was just real tough to drive so i just tried to stay clean as best i could there and pass cars cleanly and just pick away at it
3233129 i dont want to be labeled a road racer and by the way i am 10th in the nationwide series standings
3233130 i just really want to be respectful to the guys who are doing it week in and week out its not my place to stick my nose in and ruin someone elses day thats fighting for the chase
3233131 if i was going to pass tony i was going to do it clean i really thought about it i wanted to have a crack at it but i just wasnt close enough
3233132 the difference between second and third was small compared to the negative it would have been had i taken out one of these chase guys and gotten a bad reputation
3233133 its just great i can give them a bit of a lift
3233134 ive dragged my family a long way away from friends and family down home
3233135 its just a lot of commitment but when you have a weekend like this it validates the choices ive made
3233136 ive gone down this road before and races come and go and youve got to stay level you dont want to get too high when the goings good and you dont want to get too low when the goings bad
3233137 being here for three years and playing hard it was kind of crazy to see a team like new england who everybody views as the gurus of scouting who do such a great job of bringing in late round picks and free agents and turning them into superstars
3233138 just because they didnt sign me doesnt mean they dont like me a lot they proved that by just bringing me in they could have brought in any linebacker and they chose to bring me in so even though it didnt work out it was still something i was very happy about
3233139 i dont get too many chances to start stuck behind first round picks at middle linebacker since ive been here but i believe in myself and im pretty sure the organization believes in me they put me out there and gave me a start and every time i get out there on the field i think i play well and try to show what i can do and show i can be a starter
3233140 its weird playing special teams for three years here and being told indirectly thats your role on this team and then having a team say hey weve seen your preseason film of you starting youve come in in the regular season when guys have gotten hurt and played well and then special teams youve been a monster and we think you have starting potential
3233141 that was a tremendous honor and something i wanted teams to see since ive been in the nfl
3233142 hes played a lot of football for us he actually started a game for us a couple of years ago i thought he did well operating in there in beasons absence its unfortunate that jon wasnt in there but that usually opens the door for somebody else and i thought adam managed the game very well
3233143 i think ive been very productive when ive been on the field
3233144 i think i get better every year thats the goal of any nfl player to improve every year when you dont do that thats when your time in the league becomes shorter when you stay the same or become complacent
3233145 dont call me from the hospital because im not coming to get you
3233146 mulai hari ini saya akan membimbing mendapatkan tambahan melaui internet
3233147 he is a player with tremendous work ethic and showed last year that he is a player that can contribute
3233148 when somebody is on the thing youve got to do is get them the ball
3233149 i dont remember her missing except maybe once or twice
3233150 shes so unselfish i think she got a little gun shy we were like tina shoot it she was hot hot hot
3233151 if you picked the best five players in the world shes one of them
3233152 its funny even in houston when they were so successful all you heard was cynthia cooper and swoopes they did their thing but tina was the one that always stood out to me
3233153 even in 2004 at the athens olympics she was the one that always stepped up and hit big shots she is our go to in a lot of ways
3233154 recognition is not what i play for i play this game definitely to win
3233155 i enjoy playing this game and i enjoy playing at the level that im playing at and hopefully ive been a role model enough to affect one little girl if thats possible for me my job is done
3233156 hes seen us for a long time he might be a little over us
3233157 that was four peat tina thats the old tina thompson that ive gotten to know
3233158 there is nobody that i want to go into a game with more than tina shes a winner
3233159 i dont know if i can rank this moment this particular game but being here in general it ranks pretty high
3233160 its the second time for me being a part of the olympic games considering the caliber of player that we have in our country its not easy to be on this team right now its probably in about second place but around the 23rd the night of the gold medal game it might move up depending on the outcome
3233161 i am glad that wachovia is at the table with us
3233162 fridays meeting was productive and we made progress toward an agreement that will ensure investors have access to their money
3233163 investors should be able to access their money as promised and i am committed to finding a solution that will make them whole as quickly as possible
3233164 we are meeting with regulators today in jefferson city and look forward to the discussions
3233165 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3233166 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3233167 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3233168 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3233169 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3233170 how many pilgrims came to the holy city this year
3233171 none of them however in baghdad there is a shoemaker called ali mufiq who did not make the pilgrimage but did have his pilgrimage accepted and his graces benefited the 600 000 pilgrims

3233175 youll get off a plane and on the bus that does the circuit road around the airport
3233176 there are close to 200 refueling stations in the world hopefully we will be able to put one on rte 128
3233177 the time is ripe to hold a scientific conference to examine how planets form and evolve both within our solar system and around other stars as well as their physical characteristics
3233178 this event provides researchers with a unique opportunity to examine all sides of this issue and talk about it face to face they can also sit down with educators to discuss how to broach the planet definition controversy in the classroom
3233179 a celestial body that is in orbit around the sun has sufficient mass for its self gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a nearly round shape and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit
3233180 no votes will be taken at this conference to put specific objects in or out of the family of planets
3233181 but we will have advocates of the iau definition and proponents of alternative definitions presenting their cases
3233182 this topic provides the perfect opportunity to teach science as a process not a collection of facts
3233183 we also need to stress the importance of incorporating new discoveries to continually improve our understanding of the diverse objects within planetary systems
3233184 were going to do something that the iau did not which is discuss what we know about planetary bodies in the solar system and around other stars and discuss the value of different ways of defining objects as planets and what that means
3233185 if a new consensus emerges it will easily overturn the iau this is not an issue
3233186 if not theyll stick with what theyve got until something better comes along
3233187 regarding the resolution itself the situation is still somewhat muddled
3233188 i further note that there have been particularly large swings in the theories of outer solar system dynamical evolution during the past decade what was conventional wisdom five years ago has been replaced with the latest fad and i dont expect that situation to change any time soon
3233189 they should have gone with something clean like a size criterion seems to me like a muddled compromise which will just cause more problems and the issue will have to be revisited again
3233190 i think the demotion of pluto into the realm of other minor objects outside the orbit of neptune is the most consistent thing to do to straighten out the nomenclature of our solar system
3233191 im too lazy to put sunscreen on a lot of guys do the company supplies it
3233192 i dont think of whats happening in the future to my body

3233219 we could run out there could be two or three major accidents at the same time and there could already be demand because of surgeries that were already scheduled and we could find ourselves without enough blood for all the people who would need it
3233220 we have to hustle we go to orlando and get blood from our branch there we spend a million dollars a month importing blood from up north new york and pennsylvania and washington
3233221 its frustrating weve had to wait up to seven hours for blood to become available and sometimes if theres a more critical situation going on it means we have to wait until the blood that kyle might have gotten is replaced

3233262 this is not the second coming of the satanic verses
3233263 id received very positive feedback from organisers of the mwa and being a previous winner was advised i was hot favourite to win for a second year running however when i asked the judges for feedback on my novel they told me that it had not been included in the submissions they were asked to judge it was only then that i realised my work was being censored by the muslims writers awards project
3233264 because my creative effort is being treated as if its somehow unclean and unworthy clearly the muslim writers awards has decided that the novel is so unpalatable for them that it needs to be buried
3233265 im deeply dismayed that a project like this which is supposed to unearth new talent and celebrate artistic expression has been hijacked by the puritan mindset yes its true that not all the muslim characters in my book are model citizens however this is just a reflection of the realities we face today
3233266 its unseemly that my novel is being treated as if its the second coming of the satanic verses i have created a work of fiction which is neither blasphemous nor disrespectful towards any particular group or individual

3233278 cheapest prices in many southern towns are still two to three pence per litre above what drivers are paying in areas where competitive supermarkets are engaged in a dogfight
3233279 but we dont see much fanfare from the supermarkets when they are putting prices up which makes it hard to identify who is leading the way when there are price rises

3233289 striking out at six or eight or even ten different countries could well expand this war of which we wanted no part without defining the enemy there is no way to know our precise goal or to know when the war is over inadvertently more casual acceptance of civilian deaths as part of this war im certain will prolong the agony and increase the chances of even more american casualties we must guard against this if at all possible
3233290 i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3233291 in 2004 i won the gold medal for myself today i won it for all my supporters and fans
3233292 ive been waiting for this gold medal for eight years
3233293 this time on the stage has been a perfect ending to my career
3233294 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3233295 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3233296 there are similarities between shooting in the wild and at competitions
3233297 dove hunting definitely helps here because the target presentations are similar
3233298 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3233299 two more days of racing and hopefully the medal race if everything goes well i feel fine with the position im in
3233300 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3233301 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3233302 its good to send a signal to the chinese people that we respect them that this is about their country
3233303 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
3233304 i think the highlight was getting my picture taken with the teams
3233305 its just a very energetic feeling you know they represent the best of u s athletics and they were really excited about their events and theyre full of hope it was just a very uplifting experience
3233306 its an international games there are people from all over the world watching and not cheering madly
3233307 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3233308 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3233309 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3233310 its the ability to cast white as black and black as white which is surprising the ability to cast the aggressor as the victim and blame the victims for the consequences
3233311 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3233312 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3233313 not only is she opposing the rail plan shes actually leading the charge against it what a lady
3233314 across the board involuntary discharge numbers have risen in recent years
3233315 advocates for the elderly say it can be a stretch
3233316 transfer residents to another nursing home or send them to a hospital or psychiatric facility for treatment and observation and then refuse to take them back

3233320 she said that he was in love with her and she was in love with him and that the relationship was solid
3233321 misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
3233322 i had been in los angeles that day to do an event with the mayor and that afternoon i got a call in my hotel room from a gentleman named bob mcgovern and he asked me to come and meet with them

3233325 is it possible that he wanted to help them because they were in a difficult time of course is it possible that he was worried that in fact something had happened with me and he wanted to help i mean i think all these things are possible
3233326 estando na raia de fora at ent o os outros n o podiam me ver
3233327 sei que park poderia ser forte nos ltimos 50 metros e por isso eu tinha que me manter focado e concentrado
3233328 uma competi o diferenciada e a experi ncia pesa muito mesmo muito diferente dos torneios de t nis

3233332 a gente jogou muito mal o advers rio campe o ol mpico mas a gente n o ajudou muito sab amos que ia ser um jogo forte e n o fizemos frente para eles

3233334 claro que o jogo desta ter a foi ruim abaixo das expectativas temos que melhorar nosso esp rito competitivo dentro da quadra para superar advers rios como pol nia e espanha temos que jogar muito bem se queremos ganhar aqui
3233335 o time est lutando muito para fazer um gol e jogar de igual para igual a gente sabe o potencial das equipes europ ias a cro cia foi muito bem no contra ataque e na finaliza o foram muito profissionais e fizeram a parte deles
3233336 espero fazer um jogo de igual para igual com a china e surpreender contra a pol nia mas a gente sabe o potencial dos europeus

3233347 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3233348 satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters
3233349 there was a six minute steadicam shot with young christian bale he goes outside all the way through the camp into the barracks and all the way to where john malkovich is waiting with these guys me and joe pantoliano and i screwed up my line my one little line
3233350 no no no you never cut you never cut and spielberg is yelling while i lost all the blood in my body spielberg was nice enough to actually say hey dont worry about it whenever ive crossed paths with him weve joked about that moment
3233351 its so funny because it was so never our intention
3233352 if i had been targeting someone you would know because i wouldnt have stopped until i destroyed him
3233353 im making fun of myself as much as i am eddie murphy
3233354 to toms credit he thought it was funny and i think its because he just has a really great sense of humor about himself

3233364 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
3233365 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3233366 i was out in open water and i was in the outside lane which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3233367 when i saw the clock i thought i had made a mistake and i only knew i had won when i saw the number one by my name
3233368 i was a little bit surprised a little bit relieved
3233369 its not every day you feel that way you never get used to it
3233370 an olympic gold is an olympic gold the time the race none of it matters its all about the gold
3233371 a meta ganhar a terceira medalha em londres percebi uma evolu o muito grande em mim mesmo com as les es dos ltimos anos
3233372 n o fiquei frustrado por n o ter conseguido o ouro mas acredito que estava mais preparado para isso do que em atenas a luta que perdi foi dura dei tudo o que eu podia e por algum motivo ele foi melhor do que eu tirando a minha chance de ganhar o ouro
3233373 eu tomei duas puni es e vi o tempo correndo foi a que eu me concentrei e parti para cima mas eu sempre acreditei que pudesse ter um bom resultado aqui como aconteceu
3233374 all had fond memories of days spent riding the comet the dodge em cars or the rocket ship
3233375 there were memories of dancing to the music of the great bands or being frightened by the outbursts of the laughing lady all remembered the july fourth fireworks at the lake and there were even tales of monkey island before the monkeys escaped when a prankster put a plank across to the island
3233376 his trip ended a little differently as he fell on his bottom half way down
3233377 tom ober used to put his hands in the air and scream as he rode the wooden roller coaster the comet ethel ertle recalled going there for company picnics the custard ice cream cones were her favorite
3233378 kay cavelli told of the merry go round with the beautiful painted horses
3233379 after watching the movie and rehashing old times we became inspired to take a field trip to the former amusement park which is mostly condominiums now
3233380 we finished the day with a trip to tims tavern for some fish and there on the walls were murals of the old park
3233381 meyers lake was a wonderful place for the young and old and in a way i guess it still is because for the residents at the oaks of shady lawn and even for some of the staff it lives on forever in our memories
3233382 it takes great hubris to resurrect an issue the court has already definitely struck down
3233383 this is like a zombie movie their proposal to toss the endangered species act over the cliff died but now has somehow come back to life
3233384 the bush cheney administration is looking back over the last eight years to see what real benefits theyve brought to those who favor short term gain over our environment they have little to show due to vigilance by conservation fishing and hunting groups who have worked to hold the line nonetheless theyre trying again to leave favors for powerful friends before leaving office
3233385 mama someday i want to be an olympic athlete i want to be a synchronized diver

3233390 lo genial de esta t cnica es que es totalmente reutilizable
3233391 discerning requirements of young drivers looking for an athletic car
3233392 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3233393 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3233394 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3233395 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3233396 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3233397 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3233398 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3233399 hes an amazing hitter he can help any offense out no doubt about it im glad to have him here
3233400 he puts up some amazing power numbers you know hes going to hit some home runs and he brings us some excitement to the game as well
3233401 hes a guy that produces a lot of runs he draws some walks and has a good on base percentage i dont know where theyre going to stick him but wherever it is hes going to do some damage
3233402 at this point in time simply making any personnel adjustments that inevitably will lead to us winning ballgames im all for it
3233403 im looking forward to adam simply doing what he does and contributing for us down the stretch and inevitably helping support us win a division title
3233404 i didnt know we were trying to build a basketball team
3233405 weve got the biggest team in the history of baseball
3233406 when people get an up close and personal look at him they wont be surprised how far he can hit
3233407 hey is it going to help me during the night am i going to come in in the morning also and its blue screened because i didnt have the critical patch
3233408 how could would this have helped me and model it
3233409 you know what we could have fixed that and this is the model
3233410 hey im at home i got a blue screen now what do i do
3233411 hey im trying to find my home versus having a secure home connection
3233412 can i be in my boot up and be able to phone home to my enterprise and they immediately can see my bios and look at my errors and be able to fix me down the wire
3233413 we extended a little bit more than what we anticipated but after observing him down in the bullpen today it was well worth it
3233414 theres a huge ceiling for him weve had pretty good luck with high school pitchers over the years we certainly didnt want to lose him
3233415 i wouldnt rule that one out theres definitely a chance im optimistic
3233416 i just described what i went through and wished him the best
3233417 its a difficult choice the minor leagues is a great way to learn too
3233418 the minor league season tends to be long and there are disappointments along with the excitement
3233419 enjoy the marathon be patient work hard and enjoy the level youre at
3233420 in the beginning there was jack and jack had a groove and from this groove came the groove of all grooves and while one day when jack was viciously throwing down at his box jack rolled and declared let there be house and housemusic was born
3233421 it was totally out of my mind until i got the phone call from the tribune chronicle i couldnt believe it
3233422 they have a pattern all right theyve been dumping them in the same hole almost 50 years apart
3233423 i came from saint marys grade school i was very naive
3233424 were just going to have to ad lib a little bit and do two practices at night
3233425 were going to be stressed for time a little bit
3233426 and i think our kids are going to be a little more stressed because were going to have practice longer at the end of the school day
3233427 the concern we have as a staff is are we going to have everything in for that first game
3233428 are we going to be fundamentally sound offensively defensively and special teams
3233429 that can be a little overwhelming for the coaches can be overwhelming for the kids
3233430 were not going to be able to do some of the things we did last year or the year before but weve already made some adjustments to what were going to do and well figure it out and get it done
3233431 its going to be a new experience for the kids
3233432 its also going to be something new for the coaches and theres going to be some glitches and hopefully we can figure it out so we can maximize our time in practice
3233433 the rich rules over the poor and the borrower becomes the lenders slave
3233434 you cant bring pikes back but this can hold those responsible accountable for their actions
3233435 if theres any culpability here its on winnfield for not properly training police officers
3233436 knowingly tolerated and turned a blind eye to an unjustifiable risk and frequency of such mistaken identity arrests
3233437 i never knew he would have booked me in under any other name i didnt notice it until they started calling me alia ahmed
3233438 i kept telling myself that after they took my fingerprints they would find out right away but they didnt
3233439 i thought they had the perfect system but sometimes things go wrong
3233440 were going to have to win a lot of games
3233441 we will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this
3233442 in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3233443 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3233444 18 or 19 russian warplanes and killed hundreds of russian troops
3233445 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3233446 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3233447 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3233448 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3233449 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3233450 one thing we are certain of this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
3233451 they just disappeared he just noticed at some point that they werent there any more he didnt think much of of it because he hardly knew them
3233452 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3233453 it is where i was born my parents live there and i go back as often as i can and i will never not represent zimbabwe as long as im swimming
3233454 i guess when i stop swimming that is when ill stop representing zimbabwe
3233455 we dont talk about losing we just have our eyes on what we came here to do
3233456 it happened and the sooner we can come to grips with that the better off we will be for me personally anger is not an emotion i will allow myself to indulge in
3233457 our focus has been on trying to attend to barbara and her needs and trying to deal with the shock of losing todd and trying to begin the grieving process as well
3233458 clearly elisabeth was a victim in this as well even though she was physically unscathed he said
3233459 having to deal with this event has been hard for her
3233460 she has shown incredible strength in the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it and there have been a lot of tears and hugs the fact that shes able to get in amongst it and already be able to address what happened is a testament to her strength of character
3233461 i believe random acts of violence are random acts of violence he said
3233462 it seems unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3233463 he was a great father a loving husband its hard to imagine a nicer person that this tragic and senseless thing could happen to
3233464 we are all definitely emotionally drained and have been playing with a lot of emotion for the last 48 hours said lindsey berg an ex gopher
3233465 we will stay strong for the family and the whole u s delegation
3233466 i think its hard to ever expect that especially being in independent baseball this time last year
3233467 i came out of independent ball just looking for a chance to play and i got the chance and made the best of it
3233468 i was only in high a for like nine days before i came up
3233469 so i think they saw something in me that i could get people out
3233470 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me
3233471 i wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew park tae hwan was going to have a good last 50 meters so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3233472 i thought the 200 freestyle record by ian would last for 10 maybe 20 years
3233473 you can only say congratulations fantastic race second place was the best i could give
3233474 the ultimate and abominable failure of this effort has sort of erased it from wrestling lore but thats unfortunate because its a real soap opera with a compelling cast of characters
3233475 putting pro wrestlings power barons of yesteryear in one company giving them equal power and expecting anything less than an explosive cocktail of backstabbing thievery and selfishness would be a vacation from reality
3233476 the world has a moral duty to stop this madness
3233477 this is the moment when a choice should be made between morality and so called pragmatics its all about the independence and democracy of georgia
3233478 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3233479 surely well be able to make michigans and floridas primaries count
3233480 we wanted to create a fan series that was truly different from the competition and best in class in terms of noise and performance
3233481 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
3233482 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
3233483 there is a story that explains why the most important basic brown sauce in french cuisine is called sauce espagnole or spanish sauce according to the story the spanish cooks of louis xiiis bride anne helped to prepare their wedding feast and insisted upon improving the rich brown sauce of france with spanish tomatoes this new sauce was an instant success and was gratefully named in honor of its creators
3233484 the world is full of desirable situations but unfortunately we can occupy but one at a time it doesnt do us any good to wring our hands over the far off things
3233485 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers
3233486 market pressures over time are going to put downward pressure on the dollar
3233487 a more competitive dollar has been the driving force in keeping
3233488 the downward spiral in house prices is an ongoing process that is doing a lot of damage
3233489 el viernes es mi l mite y los n meros se los presentaremos a los gremios en paritarias
3233490 fue alta en las escuelas estatales y baja en las privadas
3233491 con preocupaci n con angustia que muchas escuelas no hayan recibido directamente a los alumnos
3233492 ser muy cuidadoso a lo que es el marco institucional que se prev para este tipo de situaciones cuando hay diferencias que son las paritarias
3233493 as llegar a al 50 por ciento anual ni lo pensamos
3233494 no tuvimos ning n tipo de propuesta concreta sobre la mesa vimos que se estaba dilatando la negociaci n se exced an en plazos razonables
3233495 lo de hoy pretendemos que sea una fuerte exhortaci n al gobierno para que en el transcurso de esta semana nos convoque y haga una propuesta concreta que tienda a resolver el conflicto
3233496 el conflicto fue inevitable debido a que no pudimos terminar la discusi n salarial antes del 26 de julio pasado
3233497 despu s de la medida de fuerza es hora que empecemos a trabajar para buscar consensos y evitar que se profundice
3233498 hay que ser prudentes y racionales en el pedido de aumento salarial
3233499 how would i know if text is an attribute of something
3233500 i just wanted to be out at the 50 metre point and thats where i was i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3233501 i knew park is strong in the last 50 metres
3233502 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3233503 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3233504 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3233505 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3233506 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3233507 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3233508 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3233509 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3233510 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3233511 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3233512 it is an amicable arrangement and we appreciate and respect the issues that ruud has highlighted with the club and are very grateful for all the hard work he has contributed while with the organisation hopefully he has laid the foundations for future success for the los angeles galaxy
3233513 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organisation today and thats a shame
3233514 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3233515 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes
3233516 this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the play offs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday

3233539 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3233540 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3233541 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3233542 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
3233543 the role of afghanistan in the fall of the ussr

3233545 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3233546 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3233547 i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him two years ago when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence

3233587 we dont want any of our student athletes harmed were taking a proactive approach and calling off football practices they will resume saturday morning
3233588 we dont know where its coming from this has happened in the last four or five days and everything should be taken care of by saturday
3233589 we dont want to lose any part of the season or have any child have something wrong
3233590 we want to make sure that the equipment is cleaned and that its cleared up everywhere we dont want it to spread any further

3233595 had no idea that they were going to want to work there once we started to grind they called us
3233596 now theyve changed their mind and have some jobs they want to take care of before we pave
3233597 they have a legal utility right of way legal access to that property to work on their own gas lines
3233598 we really cant prohibit them from exercising their legal right to get into the utility right of way and work on their own lines
3233599 so both of these are a good thing theyre a positive thing because we are saving the destruction of the streets
3233600 we do plan on doing a fair amount of crack sealing this fall and also may add a berm around the areas of graff and mill where the edge of the road is heavily rutted
3233601 serve as an economic blueprint for future development and job expansion in the 18th congressional district todays modern economy is changing rapidly and we must take dramatic steps to keep up with it this document lays out some bold ideas and challenges that will help us lead that change
3233602 this is a compilation of our findings and recommendations from an ambitious project with several hundred participants
3233603 its not a silver bullet by any means but it provides guidance and a venue for building relationships
3233604 its important to get kids to overcome the barriers that exist in many families about a lack of college exposure
3233605 we want to get them to campus and give them the confidence to see what college is all about college today is as essential as a high school diploma was 30 years ago
3233606 over the years we can create an intelligent work force that is attractive to manufacturers looking to locate in our region
3233607 its worth shooting for if we can be proactive with our educational experience that will be a significant edge over those regions which dont

3233612 its just crazy the way everything has kind of come along this year but we were fortunate its come along on us
3233613 the good lord is praying that were able to keep our car up front every week weve just been fortunate to run as well as we have at places and yet weve struggled at a couple others weve got some work to do
3233614 i heard earlier today that the 48 of jimmie johnson has been testing like 18 times this year and stuff and weve tested a couple places but nothing like that were looking forward to the next couple weeks
3233615 weve got some tests lined up and were going to try to learn something and keep our mojo going and keep it going through and into the chase
3233616 there will certainly be noticeable changes some of which i expect students will notice and a lot of which i expect parents to notice
3233617 this allows us to make some of the patches we need to make
3233618 its not like there is a tremendous and sudden huge restoration
3233619 but it does give us some tools to remediate the most immediate problems
3233620 that will come up as a point of discussion at the meetings
3233621 to me the important thing is that we are not asking the mayor or the board for more money i still dont think thats the responsible thing to do
3233622 the reality is there are class sizes that are too large
3233623 the students will continue to receive an outstanding education despite financial shortfalls
3233624 what we will see is pockets of stress where classes will be larger than we expected them to be but its not as if the world will fall apart we have done this before we know how to deal with tight times
3233625 im too lazy to put sunscreen on a lot of guys do the company supplies it
3233626 i dont think of whats happening in the future to my body
3233627 but what looks good today isnt going to look good later
3233628 i get brown i dont burn i dont really think about it
3233629 there is an epidemic of skin cancers ranging from basal cell to melanoma and its largely a result of exposure to the sun and tanning practices
3233630 youll earn 200 a week but we wont divulge the actual nature of the job until we meet you

3233632 do you really thing im going to call back and tell them my mommy wont let me take this job
3233633 waltham is the largest community in the district and i like having one on main street the visibility is very good
3233634 there was a real heavy load of things to get done there were some major pieces of legislation for waltham the big thing was connors pool
3233635 its still kind of early in the campaign season we just got started about a month ago
3233636 were reaching out to all the different towns and organizations and to past volunteers and making sure susan keeps her presence in the community
3233637 were starting to work on that right now so i would certainly invite any volunteers that want to help with the campaign to call us
3233638 its a good year for campaigning theres a lot of excitement about the presidential election ive been very pleased that a lot of young people are getting involved
3233639 as always i run a very positive campaign theres a lot to talk about education and health care and the environment are issues that i will continue to speak about
3233640 i think im planning on running to win i think i have a very solid set of accomplishments in the state senate
3233641 in december thats when we file legislation for the upcoming session
3233642 we will be having events in waltham as well as other communities in the district
3233643 i think that tends to happen right after labor day thats when people come back from vacation and start to take a look at the things thinking about politics
3233644 lord the neighbors arent enjoying these beauties as much as we are
3233645 the beauties of life on your side of heaven may fade and disappear but they gain a new quality as they blossom on my side of heavens fence just as the outburst of beauty of my roses comes from leaning into the sun so too the beauty of my children comes from leaning into my son whether on earth or here with me their beauty explodes in profuseness when they lean into their source of warmth peace love and joy
3233646 over there joining the army is pretty much like going to college here
3233647 its really important for me to go back and just be a part of it
3233648 although the arrival of our 15 000th nefesh b nefesh immigrant this summer is an exciting and significant milestone we look toward the future with growing excitement as we anticipate facilitating the expansion of western immigration to israel
3233649 i think the sense of pride and excitement overshadows that
3233650 were always the first ones to respond but many times within the hour the fbi is there
3233651 anytime weve had a bank robbery in the past they typically respond
3233652 years ago you got the fbi out there because they did a lot of the forensic stuff
3233653 now you place a call to the state police crime lab and they come out
3233654 local departments they have people that can do the same things the experts do
3233655 as it related to bank robbery they target those that are violent and target the repeaters
3233656 most cases though dont demand the fbis attention oloughlin said
3233657 do you need the taskforce to come out for that one no you know who youre looking for
3233658 really i cant weigh in as far as there being a time when we sought assistance and were told sorry we dont do that anymore
3233659 i think its clear in the post 9 11 world a lot more has been put on the fbis plate and the state polices plate and local law enforcements plate
3233660 i think the allocation of resources is something every agency federal state or local has to evaluate but from our personal experience when youve needed the fbi you pick up the phone
3233661 we welcome all cooperation from the federal authorities and other departments
3233662 we do not want to put blinders on to information other agencies may possess when trying to solve the case
3233663 our philosophy is if we have information to share to help someone else solve their bank robbery or if they have information for us we will work together
3233664 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months the fed said yesterday in its quarterly senior loan officer survey
3233665 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3233666 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3233667 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be mistaken
3233668 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3233669 this is great chance to talk to someone who you wouldnt normally meet and ask them questions about their lives without looking nosey
3233670 so often we can get stuck doing the same things talking to the same people and this is an opportunity to talk to someone whos had really different experiences to you and get another view of the world

3233677 we filmed literally blocks away from comedy clubs where i was performing in 1990 and 1991

3233679 the programs in this book include short juice fasts and specific cleanse programs that act similar to spa treatments on the inside
3233680 vast amounts of toxic substances found in our environment including carcinogens are stored in fat cells because the body uses fat to hold toxins thereby protecting delicate organs we often find it hard to lose weight ironically fat is our friend when it comes to toxins it protects us from all the acidic and toxic waste that endangers our organs but when we remove this mess through detoxing our bodies no longer need this protection so they can begin to let go of the extra fa we suddenly notice that our clothes fit better and we feel lighter and happier while fat just seems to be melting away
3233681 the way you choose to use your mind will and emotions and the way you respond to your outer world has as much if not more to do with disease as your diet lifestyle and environment the body is a mirror of your inner thoughts emotions and beliefs science has shown that when you are in a state of distress your cells come into disharmony more than any other factor emotional stress weakens the immune system and you are less likely to control anything from parasites to cancer cells

3233683 i was talking with him gerrard this morning and he will go with us to belgium
3233684 he is progressing really well but we will check after training
3233685 i will speak with the doctor and with steven and then decide
3233686 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect
3233687 they have not played in the group stages of the champions league before so they will be keen to change that also they will have the confidence of champions after winning their title
3233688 liverpool is a massive club and were expected to beat teams so im looking forward to the challenge
3233689 i certainly am ready ask any player and theyll tell you that pre season is just about getting fitness now the real business starts
3233690 whenever liverpool were playing in the champions league or in a game which had no effect on tottenham id be cheering them on the champions league is part of why i wanted to come here this is my opportunity now
3233691 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3233692 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising
3233693 from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3233694 earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3233695 the family wishes not to be disturbed at this time this is private property and they want you guys to get off the property
3233696 she lost nine weeks of work with a broken pelvis she couldnt move she was hospitalized for a while and the car was totaled
3233697 initially i thought lets just mimic what barre and rutland are doing now
3233698 then having discussed it with some other folks we said you know what lets just start a dialogue here
3233699 some of the things in my opinion maybe arent restrictive enough
3233700 others on the council others in the community maybe say its too restrictive
3233701 were fortunate that we have one of the most advanced and longest standing special investigative units in the state of vermont with cusi right here in burlington
3233702 so the resources we bring to bear relative to education prevention investigation and monitoring sex offenders are pretty robust but theres always room for improvement
3233703 whilst the details differ from place to place the important issues are the same everywhere there seems to be 5 stages we need to help people to go through to help us achieve our aim of reducing harm from misleading drug promotion
3233704 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
3233705 as a high proportion of the groups earnings are from outside singapore the financial performance is sensitive to currency movements in the countries the group operates in
3233706 the earnings contributions may be further impacted by currency fluctuations
3233707 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
3233708 i went to church here and im sure the cynics say
3233709 religion wont hurt you you ought to welcome religious people
3233710 i think its remarkable that on the occasion of the olympics that the president of the united states no less than three times in an independent secular interview brought up the issue of religious liberty and brought it up particularly with the president of china
3233711 i feel hes very sincere in his efforts to engage the chinese government on the issue of religious freedom for unregistered house churches of course lets not be na ve its not simply a matter of asking the unregistered churches to register under the current system
3233712 will there be a permanent opening of information and availability of worship or will there be a reaction a greater closing of the openness
3233713 if youre a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped
3233714 some scholars estimate that in the next century china may well become a substantially christian population and certainly be the most populous christian nation in the world
3233715 believers in china especially unregistered believers are still regularly harassed and persecuted by the authorities in a lot of locations around china our estimates are over 700 protestant pastors last year were arrested for some period time simply for normal church activity
3233716 there are many individual cases for advocacy that people can become informed on our web site
3233717 given the number of christians in china right now and the number of bibles printed legally in china thats not a possibility unless outside groups like open doors provide ways for christians to receive bibles
3233718 we have a ministry center that is reaching out to all those neighboring provinces including south ossetia this is a huge catastrophe for so many people about 2 000 people are killed there are about 30 000 refugees
3233719 there is no communication but people who managed to escape told him that three evangelical churches that were assisting were damaged there in chinvali
3233720 they got together and they were trying minister to the families of refugees that are pouring out of south ossetia into north ossetia and into other russian provinces there
3233721 we are mobilizing christian counselors those who are trained and already have experience especially after beslan and chechnya
3233722 and it is now escalating into a political issue as south ossetia declared its independence from both georgia and russia
3233723 i am concerned that international aid might not be allowed to get to the region because of politics
3233724 i also am praying that the authorities can come to a peaceful diplomatic solution to this fighting
3233725 that god would give wisdom and guidance how to deal with this crisis and how our national workers would find the resources and be available to all of these refugee families but also to give for this ministry to reach out to family who lost everything
3233726 these were programs that she broadcast in dutch and had never before been translated into english essentially its kind of like finding a fort knox in terms of original content from corrie ten boom thats never been translated into english
3233727 there was virtually nothing that we had to change in terms of updating or making something relevant or taking a message and thinking what shes saying here is not pertinent for today its remarkably timeless the devotional thoughts that she had
3233728 our hope is is that there will be a whole new generation of people and readers out there who may not have been familiar with corrie ten boom and her story and the hiding place who will be brand new to this story
3233729 i came home in 1958 full of idealism and activism to discover that very little was being done
3233730 students were not taken seriously here before the civil rights movement and private money receded at the mention of a communist youth festival
3233731 far from being shocked by this involvement i was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were far sighted and cared enough to get americans of all political views to the festival
3233732 i was never asked to report on other americans or assess foreign nationals i had met
3233733 the c i a s big mistake was not supplanting itself with private funds fast enough
3233734 to compete more effectively with this obviously successful communist apparatus
3233735 this is the first time commies have held one of these shindigs on our side of the iron curtain and what goes on how it goes on and what the follow up will be is i think extremely important
3233736 full of idealism and activism to discover that very little was being done
3233737 far from being shocked by this involvement i was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were far sighted and cared enough to get americans of all political views to the festival

3233750 while working through these difficult market conditions in the first half of the year we focused our efforts on fixed and variable cost reduction and the successful implementation of lean principles throughout the entire organization as we position the company for uncertain economic conditions for the remainder of the year we also improved our balance sheet by paying down a significant portion of our borrowings and raising equity in a private placement and a rights offering
3233751 moving into the second half of the year we plan to mitigate the slowness in the rv and mh industries through continued focus on cost containment continuous improvement and lean operating initiatives at all levels of the organization to maximize our improved market position gained from the adorn acquisition
3233752 when we first purchased adorn llc we felt this was a transformational event for both companies and the first important step in patrick industries inc becoming the premier manufacturer and distributor of building and component products to the rv and mh industries and we are pleased with our progress so far
3233753 since the acquisition in may 2007 we have closed and consolidated ten operations and two operating cells and reduced our headcount by 640 including 70 salaried positions we continue to see significant synergies from the acquisition and estimate our annualized cost savings in 2008 to be more than 3 million during the first half of 2008 we estimate we have already realized approximately 1 5 million in combined annualized cost savings from the integration
3233754 with our leaner combined operations stronger management team and improving balance sheet we have repositioned patrick over the first six months of 2008 to compete in the currently difficult rv and mh markets we are also in a better position to execute our long term strategic plan based on market penetration enhanced capacity utilization improving operating efficiencies product development and strategic and accretive acquisition opportunities

3233757 2008 wird die werbekonjunktur trotz schw cherem wirtschaftswachstum wenig an tempo verlieren auch weil die euro und die bevorstehende nationalratswahl f r sonderimpulse sorgen

3233766 wfp remains concerned over the growing number of persons displaced by the violence between the armed forces and the milf many of the affected population are women and children and we are concerned for their wellbeing and stand ready to support humanitarian needs
3233767 we hope for peace so that these families can return to their communities
3233768 wfp fully understands that the situation remains fluid and we will continue to work closely with all concerned to further assess the total number of affected persons and adjust our response accordingly
3233769 primary aim in the philippines is to support the mindanao peace process by providing food aid to meet urgent needs as an immediate peace dividend for conflict affected communities

3233780 i came home in 1958 full of idealism and activism to discover that very little was being done
3233781 students were not taken seriously here before the civil rights movement and private money receded at the mention of a communist youth festival
3233782 far from being shocked by this involvement i was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were far sighted and cared enough to get americans of all political views to the festival
3233783 i was never asked to report on other americans or assess foreign nationals i had met
3233784 the c i a s big mistake was not supplanting itself with private funds fast enough
3233785 to compete more effectively with this obviously successful communist apparatus
3233786 this is the first time commies have held one of these shindigs on our side of the iron curtain and what goes on how it goes on and what the follow up will be is i think extremely important

3233813 in the final analysis as engels once expressed it the proletariat must win its emancipation on the battlefield but there is not only the question of winning in this sense but of how we win in the largest sense one of the significant if perhaps subtle and often little noticed ways in which the enemy even in defeat seeks to exact revenge on the revolution and sow the seed of its future undoing is in what he would force the revolutionaries to become in order to defeat him it will come to this we will have to face him in the trenches and defeat him amidst terrible destruction but we must not in the process annihilate the fundamental difference between the enemy and ourselves here the example of marx is illuminating he repeatedly fought at close quarters with the ideologists and apologists of the bourgeoisie but he never fought them on their terms or with their outlook with marx his method is as exhilarating as his goal is inspiring we must be able to maintain our firmness of principles but at the same time our flexibility our materialism and our dialectics our realism and our romanticism our solemn sense of purpose and our sense of humor

3233817 the first generation is not always approving of the third generations job choices
3233818 how much is enough and when do we tell them the worry is that telling your children too early that they stand to inherit may engender a sense of entitlement if you tell them too late they are not prepared
3233819 if you want to leave them nothing thats fine but be sure they are prepared for that

3233822 at the basis of black liberation theology is the understanding that god has a special place in his heart for those at the bottom of the ladder

3233824 if you dont get out of the pool by the next swimmer that comes in youre disqualified my biggest goal was trying to make it to the ladder because i was out of breath and i was afraid i was going to drown
3233825 i saw jason coming in and it was the last 25 meters in and he was right there on the lane line right next to bernard and i was just like oh my god please let him pull this off please let him pull this off come on come on come on i was just screaming my head off

3233827 is it the suit the suit doesnt get up at 5 30 in the morning like i do im not going to sit back and say yes the suit helped us i refuse
3233828 it doesnt hurt but it doesnt make the swimmer come in first we did that
3233829 i guess a 46 0 the fastest split ever definitely did help

3233833 i had practice in new york and we lived in new jersey thats an hour away i had 5 30 in the morning practice and wed get up really really early and my parents would sit in the car and wait for me to finish practice my friends always thought my parents were snipers
3233834 i can talk to kids all day its more getting the parents to support it the kids cant get to practice on their own

3233878 interior design with feng shui the placement of rooms within a home can affect residents behavior for instance the room nearest the entrance will by the suggestive nature of its use and contents determine residents lifestyle at home particularly if it is located very close to the main door if the first room is a kitchen the household will be food oriented the sight of the kitchen will create a pavlovian need for food encouraging excessive eating
3233879 insufficient physical exercise is a risk factor in many chronic diseases and is estimated to cause 1 9 million deaths worldwide each year
3233880 hunters are doing something they love and helping others at the same time
3233881 however some people cant afford organic foods and sportsmen against cancer provides meat at no cost
3233882 not very likely that wild animals were injected with hormones
3233883 if the hunter cuts up his her own deer he or she should wear surgical gloves and not have any open cuts or sores on their hands
3233884 if the hunter has the deer processed does that processor sterilize its equipment after each deer is cut up so cross contamination does not occur
3233885 where other animals can eat it and the blood can be filtered through the soil and enter the ground water
3233886 this is disheartening and we certainly dont think this program should come to an end on the unscientific assessment that has occurred here
3233887 deer venison provided through the generosity of our hunters is a highly valuable food source for some of iowas less fortunate citizens
3233888 we certainly have an obligation to ensure its safety but we also dont want to be wasteful of this valuable resource if we dont need to
3233889 the main problem with this argument is that it does not justify the practice of meat eating or animal husbandry as we know it today it justifies hunting
3233890 when one species of animal preys on another in nature it only preys on a very small proportion of the total species population
3233891 moreover only the weakest members of the prey species are the predators victims the feeble the sick the lame or the young accidentally separated from the fold
3233892 as it exists in the wild hunting is the preying upon isolated members of an animal herd
3233893 why are hunters not butchers most frequently taken to task by the larger community for their killing of animals hunters usually react to such criticism by replying that if hunting is wrong then meat hunting must be wrong as well the hunter is certainly right on one point the larger community is hypocritical to object to hunting when it consumes the flesh of domesticated animals if any form of meat eating is justified it would be meat from a hunted animal
3233894 killing an animal is in itself a troubling act it has been said that if we had to kill our own meat we would all be vegetarians there may be exceptions to that general rule but it is true that most people prefer not to inquire into the killing of the animals they eat
3233895 very few people ever visit a slaughterhouse and films of slaughterhouse operations are rarely shown on television yet those who by their purchases require animals to be killed have no right to be shielded from this or any other aspect of the production of the meat they buy
3233896 if it is distasteful for humans to think about what can it be like for the animals to experience it
3233897 by ceasing to rear and kill animals for food we can make extra food available for humans that properly distributed it would eliminate starvation and malnutrition from this planet animal liberation is human liberation too
3233898 all they have to do is stop eating meat thats the single most important thing you could do its staggering when you think about it vegetarianism takes care of so many things in one shot ecology famine cruelty
3233899 what is the hidden curriculum here what does this story tell you
3233900 if we cant save the patient the patient doesnt matter
3233901 before he died this patient had spent two months in the icu we had done everything possible to prolong the dying process
3233902 either we are doing everything possible to try to prolong your life or when there is nothing more that we can do only then do we make the switch to providing comfort measures this dichotomous notion that you can do one thing alone and then the other thing alone later has nothing to do with the reality of what patients and their families go through
3233903 i think because i was very close to my grandfather
3233904 become more and more alienated from medicine here in the hospital everyone was running around ostensibly trying to help the patient but actually often hurting the patient i thought about quitting i had a fantasy of opening a bakery book shop where i could read and eat brownies
3233905 then i met a patient i will call mr santanaya
3233906 i went to the nurse and asked why is this man in a four point restraint
3233907 to me he looked about twelve years old and terrified
3233908 sick people need to be treated for their illness not as potential drug addicts
3233909 the relief of suffering is a fundamental part of medicine
3233910 in this country there is a tremendous amount of stigma associated with opiates
3233911 this is why pain is so poorly managed in this country

3233914 never call a man lucky until you know how he died
3233915 i like to blame the victim but i dont volunteer at a hospice or anything
3233916 i do find it easier working on a regular show than to be flying all over to different movie sets in different cities
3233917 im not saying its easy working these hours but our whole crew is awesome
3233918 i certainly want to look the best i possibly can
3233919 but i keep coming back to this theory that you have to work with what youve got and grow older gracefully i have fair skin and freckles so i work with that and i dont wear some of the clothes i wore 10 years ago and certainly not the ones i wore 20 years ago even if i can pull it off its tacky
3233920 my mother is a breast cancer survivor yet she has always looked on the bright side of life i find that kind of person fascinating someone who has been through a hardship but is able to keep going with a positive attitude
3233921 i cant let the ball drop for very long because otherwise it all passes you by and i enjoy life too much for that
3233922 if you think cigarette smoking is bad for your health try a dead end job
3233923 what matters in determining mortality and health in a society is less the overall wealth of that society and more how evenly wealth is distributed the more equally wealth is distributed the better the health of that society

3233925 firebaugh argues that in evaluating their own incomes individuals compare themselves to their peers of the same age therefore a persons reported level of happiness depends on how his or her income compares to others in the same age group using comparison groups on the basis of age the researchers find evidence of both relative and absolute effects but relative income is more important than absolute income in determining the happiness of individuals in the united states
3233926 they charge whatever they want there is no government control and frankly we will not fix our system until we remove these private insurance companies
3233927 well they won what do you mean they cant win they won
3233928 no we cant say that on nbc we cant say that cuba won
3233929 well yeah but they won they provided the fastest care they were the cheapest and the patient was happy and the bone got fixed
3233930 ive had a number of firefighters tell me over the years and since fahrenheit 9 11 that they heard these explosions that they believe theres much more to the story than weve been told i dont think the official investigations have told us the complete truth they havent even told us half the truth
3233931 if we all throw in with them too soon on this without forcing them to take good positions on these issues i dont think were going to get anywhere
3233932 the french utilize more care than americans do averaging six physician visits a year to our 2
3233933 in order to prevent cost sharing from penalizing people with serious medical problems the way health savings accounts threaten to do the french government limits every individuals out of pocket expenses in addition the government has identified thirty chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension for which there is usually no cost sharing in order to make sure people dont skimp on preventive care that might head off future complications
3233934 esteemed medical system is a fucking disgrace report this comment
3233935 moore zeroes in on this nixonian moment which encapsulates the films premise that the united states health care system is defined by a fundamental conflict profit versus care and no surprise profit beats care

3233940 regardless of what happens next it is worth asking what the bush people were thinking when they egged on mikheil saakashvili georgias young western educated president to apply for nato membership send 2 000 of his troops to iraq as a full fledged u s ally and receive tactical training and weapons from our military did they really think putin would sit by and see another border state and former province of the russian empire slip away to the west if they thought that putin might not what did they plan to do about it and how firmly did they warn saakashvili not to get too brash or provoke an outburst
3233941 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3233942 the russians responded by bombing the civilian airport in georgias capital tblisi and by stepping up its offensive in abkhazia this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3233943 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution befo the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3233944 we should move ahead with the resolution despite russian veto threats and submit russia to the court of world public opinion

3234102 in china theres a tradition called losing face so its very important that you never lose your composure and you never shed any bad light on the person youre dealing with

3234108 i always bring a jar of peanut butter wherever i go and i brought cheerios because i knew i was going to have euphemism alert travelers dilemma there was going to be some stomach issue so whats the food you want to make you feel better i brought peanut butter and i brought cheerios you have to think about what foods going to bring you back
3234109 i was able to keep my composure about everything but this when you walk into a store in china a real bona fide store a clerk will just follow you the entire time shell be in your blind spot youre just looking and shell be right here as it was explained to me this is just good service it drove me crazy id try to lose them finally they would tire they understood dont take it personally but it drives you nuts its the one thing i couldnt be polite about
3234110 the commercialism is so in your face there its not my idea of communism whatever price they give you you want to knock it down at least a third i always have a problem with this but they expect you to bargain its part of their culture you never just walk away with that first price and then again always smile be patient be polite
3234111 this was one of my biggest disappointments and this happened to me a couple of times id be in a tea house not a touristy house at all and i was given lipton tea in a bag

3234119 we had to get rid of this guy because he kept crashing cars and the sponsor was going to go with this other team because their new driver has really nice hair and enunciates
3234120 i knew tony stewart was going to be hard to beat i was racing against the same stuff with tony stewart and joe gibbs racing and toyota so i knew it was going to be hard to beat tony stewart hes such a great friend and such a great teammate and im really going to hate to see him leave at the end of the year i have to thank the fans because they are the ones that make us race everybody out there i appreciate your support
3234121 i was pretty happy with it and it was pretty uneventful from our side we didnt have any big dramas during the race the red there at the end kind of killed us a little bit really happy with the day proud of kyle busch and how he ran i saw behind us that denny hamlin was having a good day too im really proud of the whole organization its days like today that you want every week to be uneventful and to be this smooth everyday
3234122 its just a great weekend all around i thought yesterday was great but when i wound up there on that red flag i realized where i was i was behind tony and in front of all those other great drivers im just really excited that ive been given an opportunity and ive able to be making the most of it you know you dont get many chances in life to do something special like this and today im going to look back at very fondly the whole weekend to be honest with you
3234123 it was a great day for our big red slim pack dodge charger the crew did a great job and we had a fantastic car we got a little messed up on the second pit stop im not sure what happened the pit stop itself was ok but the pit lane that we were in screwed us up a bit and we lost some spots other than that we had a really clean race
3234124 it was a lot of fun out there today i just want to thank all my guys on the bass pro chevrolet we had a really good car all day had a great engine under the hood today so i got to thank ecr engines for that just a lot of fun today it was great to get another top five its been a while coming
3234125 we ended with a good finish for our shell pennzoil impala ss it was a great points day for us but just as important it just continues to show how strong our team is we needed a couple more cautions to pit for more adjustments but all in all we rallied from a car that wasnt quite right to a good car at the end
3234126 im really proud of the guys we were good all weekened and just came up a little short we battled a tight racecar and had a tire go down early on but we were able to battle back and get a good finish
3234127 we were about a 10th place car we could have been 15th or we could have been fifth it was a great race for us we hardly made any adjustments we had to make sure we had enough fuel after last week im happy for this team to get a top 10 finish that was a good day for us right now
3234128 it doesnt matter where you are in the points until after richmond really we didnt really run that great we had a real average car and we had a real above average strategy and pit crew so those guys got me the good finish really
3234129 im going to have to go back and look at it i had a run and i went underneath him and he just didnt give me a whole lot of room maybe i shouldnt have been in there but were racing hard to stay in the top 35 in owner points and try to get back into the top 35 thats what we needed to do with our champion mortgage toyota its unfortunate and im sorry for the fans and all the cars that got wrecked there and then they had to wait through that red flag i was just racing hard and really it doesnt look much different than how it was with kyle busch and jeff burton yesterday but im sure theyll make a big deal out of it
3234130 i was trying to get around the 78 car and the first thing that i saw was someones radiator so i turned and tried to get down on the track its not a good feeling to look down and see the end of pit wall coming up really fast we got really lucky that we didnt damage the car any more then we did it was a tough day for sure
3234131 im a little sore everywhere i think but ill be ok i think
3234132 i miss being booed i miss people throwing stuff at me i want to start winning again and go through all that stuff
3234133 got to thank the fans theyre the ones that make us race so everybody out there appreciate your sport

3234356 if north american churches do not accept the need for a moratorium on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
3234357 we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches
3234358 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
3234359 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken

3234364 daily thousands of homosexuals make a life decision to leave the gay lifestyle evidenced by the growing population of pfox parents and friends of ex gays and exodus international just to name a few frequently the individuals report that the impetus to their change of heart and lifestyle was a transformative experience with god a realization that their choice of same sex practices wreaked havoc in their psychological and physical lives charlene e cothran publisher of venus magazine was an aggressive strategic supporter of gay rights and a practicing lesbian for 29 years before she renounced her sexuality and gave jesus christ stewardship of her life
3234365 the gay community vilified her angrily and withdrew financial support from her magazine upon her announcement that she was leaving the lesbian lifestyle
3234366 economic data is irrefutable the normative statistics for a homosexual in the usa include a bachelors degree for gay men the median household income is 83 000 yr gay singles 62 000 gay couples living together 130 000 almost 80 above the median u s household income of 46 326 per census data for lesbians the median household income is 80 000 yr lesbian singles 52 000 lesbian couples living together 96 000 36 of lesbians reported household incomes in excess of 100 000 yr compare that to the median income of the non college educated black male of 30 539 the data speaks for itself

3234368 national is going to have an unrelenting focus on work
3234369 paid work is the route to independence and well being for most people and is the best way to reduce child poverty long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
3234370 national will extend the part time work obligation to two groups of beneficiaries dpb recipients once their youngest dependent child is aged six or over and people on sickness and invalid benefits who have been assessed as being able to work part time
3234371 these beneficiaries will be required to spend at least 15 hours per week in employment training or job seeking activities

3234375 our focus is maintaining a clearance around those conductors so the transmission lines can be operated safely to their design capabilities
3234376 were not concerned about health of the trees or aesthetics
3234377 in the past we trimmed some trees but now we remove them
3234378 our responsibility is to ensure the reliability of our system
3234379 any accident is caused by a chain of errors and if you eliminate any one link in the chain you generally eliminate the incident
3234380 tree trimming will make a big difference because right of way incursions is one of the biggest reasons why we have outages in general
3234381 unreasonable clear cutting of trees when theyre not a threat to the safety of the high tension electric wires
3234382 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
3234383 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3234384 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3234385 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3234386 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3234387 in 2004 i won the gold medal for myself today i won it for all my supporters and fans
3234388 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3234389 why can an ordinary taiwanese just go to an elementary school and cast his vote why cant we are we second class citizens
3234390 i dont expect it to be a dreadfully long time but i cant say when that will be completed
3234391 the problem with asbestos is that when its disturbed and becomes airborne it becomes dangerous to people
3234392 police are asking anyone who sees something that resembles asbestos or anything connected to the explosion to contact authorities rather than handle it themselves

3234397 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3234398 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3234399 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3234400 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3234401 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3234402 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3234403 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3234404 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3234405 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3234406 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3234407 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3234408 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3234409 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3234410 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3234411 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3234412 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3234413 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3234414 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3234415 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3234416 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3234417 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3234418 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3234419 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3234420 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3234421 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3234422 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3234423 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3234424 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3234425 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3234426 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3234427 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3234428 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3234429 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3234430 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3234431 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3234432 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3234433 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3234434 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3234435 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3234436 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3234437 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3234438 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3234439 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3234440 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3234441 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3234442 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3234443 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3234444 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3234445 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3234446 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3234447 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3234448 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3234449 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3234450 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3234451 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3234452 it wasnt until mid 2000 when an algorithm was developed that bots could even come close to a competent player but now online computer poker playing may become a thing of the past
3234453 this is not an easy exam if you dont work hard youll find it difficult if youve been working diligently you should be able to do well
3234454 on the one hand women want fulfilment in their jobs while also having their families we cannot afford to run the one off against the other for both will suffer with the mother in the middle
3234455 for me the lack of sleep has been the greatest stumbling block especially when my children were small it was difficult to keep going over time i grew accustomed to less sleep
3234456 one does not have to act like a man to reach the top but we all have to reach not just down but around us to spread skills and knowledge to other women to really empower everyone to reach our collective goal we all have an interest in south africa coming into its own in the world
3234457 never before in our history has the opportunity been so favourable for women president thabo mbekis efforts also in creating the presidential working group on women have given us more than just a voice we are able to make representations and we have already to ensure women are given every opportunity to contribute take their places and have a real economic voice
3234458 we will fight for survival and the centre will emerge strengthened and hopefully more autonomous within this institution as recommended in a university research review
3234459 since it opened in 2002 the centre has become important to durban
3234460 you will see us at the homes of these decision makers challenging them
3234461 those of us who try to follow what is going on in south africa have come to rely upon it as the best single source of wide information closing it down would not only damage severely ukzns reputation but would set back research worldwide on contemporary south africa
3234462 the long term financial viability of the centre was not secure that we do not have permanent funding in perpetuity
3234463 we witnessed an unusual degree of hostility earlier such as vice chancellor malegapuru makgobas 2005 banning of ashwin desai from doing even voluntary research work at the centre
3234464 we have half a dozen donors who say they will continue to fund us ideally we would like to stay where we are in howard college but if the authorities intend to evict us we think we might readily find another institutional base
3234465 will cease to exist in its current form at the end of 2008 due to questions surrounding the sustained financial viability of the centre and the appropriateness of the way in which it is currently structured as an academic unit
3234466 it was recommended that a refocused civil society programme be established and integrated into the school of development studies all programmes within the university are located in schools and are led by a programme coordinator
3234467 it was further recommended that contracts of all the staff at the centre are to be honoured until they expire at the end of this year
3234468 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
3234469 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3234470 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3234471 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3234472 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3234473 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3234474 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3234475 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
3234476 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
3234477 because the united states of america did not exist yet at that time
3234478 and references to the yet to be found organization as

3234483 it will affect every driving under the influence of drugs case pending in nassau county
3234484 if the judge in these few cases agreed with the higher court then the labs location wouldnt have any legal significance
3234485 weve got offices across the state and a very robust operation
3234486 they are coming in early when its cheaper to be on tv
3234487 and they are determining if it will be worth it to push things in florida later on
3234488 its been a totally one sided affair but it hasnt bent the needle much
3234489 you always feel as though you should be able to score sometimes a guy shuts you down but weve got enough guys who can hit the ball that we should be able to score you get to a point where you get tired of always giving the pitcher credit
3234490 and obviously were not playing well and its something weve got to take care of quickly
3234491 i thought sidney pitched a heck of a game he got ground ball after ground ball he really made one mistake and it cost him the game
3234492 i have to get outs if i put zeroes on the board then were probably still playing right now but i didnt do that
3234493 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3234494 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3234495 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3234496 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3234497 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3234498 just so you all know we did set a record
3234499 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3234500 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3234501 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3234502 i do not love people because they are beautiful but they seem beautiful to me because i love them
3234503 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3234504 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
3234505 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
3234506 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
3234507 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
3234508 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
3234509 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
3234510 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3234511 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
3234512 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
3234513 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
3234514 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
3234515 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
3234516 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
3234517 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
3234518 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
3234519 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3234520 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3234521 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3234522 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3234523 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3234524 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3234525 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3234526 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3234527 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3234528 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3234529 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3234530 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3234531 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3234532 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3234533 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3234534 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3234535 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3234536 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3234537 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3234538 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3234539 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3234540 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3234541 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3234542 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3234543 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3234544 cutting extreme poverty around the world in half by 2015
3234545 so the key to the upcoming election is whether white voters will be more less or equally likely to vote for obama as for kerry i believe the answer is less likely
3234546 just as the american revolution inspired mahatma gandhi to free a great people
3234547 even if you dont like both candidates you should vote for someone because if you dont then you have no business complaining for the next 4 years you did not allow your voice to be heard
3234548 does a governorship have more credibility than congressman or senator
3234549 the average age of elected presidents since 1952 the era of televised politics is 56
3234550 mccain is scare mongering and creating fear in americans just as weve seen republicans do in the last 8 years fear seems to work which is why they are doing it again get scared of the black guy etc etc very old politics of mcbush mcsame
3234551 what i think it boils down to is are the democrats just as motivated for obama in 08 as they were with an
3234552 please tell me a mccain policy that is not in line with bush
3234553 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3234554 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3234555 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3234556 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3234557 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3234558 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3234559 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3234560 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3234561 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3234562 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3234563 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3234564 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3234565 in those years prior to 1994 if you were a black person and working in the hr department you were not trusted by your colleagues and your bosses so i had to do something else
3234566 theyre a big company im just a minute particle of their business
3234567 ive learned the hard way i burned my fingers along the way till i got settled but obviously in the beginning i didnt have any skills to run a business so i learned through mistakes
3234568 if you look at vat uif paye i had to learn those things from scratch these are things that i do myself nowadays but initially i had to contract people to do them for me and they were charging exorbitant fees
3234569 im operating in a hostile environment there are too many people selling boards
3234570 there are a lot of people who have connections and there is a lot of corruption taking place
3234571 so its difficult to say the bee codes are a good system its not theoretically bee is a good concept but when it comes to implementation thats where the problem is it might not be the government itself that is doing wrong but the guys that are doing the implementation
3234572 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3234573 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3234574 you have accepted these values but you are not doing it
3234575 you should get into power only by legal means by constitutional means
3234576 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3234577 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3234578 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3234579 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3234580 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3234581 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3234582 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3234583 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3234584 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3234585 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3234586 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3234587 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3234588 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3234589 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3234590 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3234591 that was something to watch he got ahead pitched inside and wasnt afraid it was a well played game all around
3234592 i pitched good enough to give us a chance to win
3234593 i dont know what to say im not real happy this is the fourth game in a row and the season is getting shorter thats not what we want right now
3234594 a city where walking is the most dangerous form of transportation over the last five years getting his buzz on
3234595 a city where walking is the most dangerous form of transportation over the last five years getting his buzz on
3234596 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3234597 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3234598 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3234599 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3234600 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3234601 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
3234602 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
3234603 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
3234604 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
3234605 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
3234606 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3234607 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3234608 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3234609 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3234610 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3234611 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3234612 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3234613 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3234614 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3234615 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3234616 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3234617 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3234618 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3234619 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3234620 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3234621 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3234622 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3234623 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3234624 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3234625 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3234626 after medvedev said the operation was finished the market turned around and went up but there is a lot of uncertainty ahead
3234627 no we dont do that why dont you just order the pork one
3234628 you know what this looks a little crazy can i get something else
3234629 no its not crazy its just the very bottom of the keg
3234630 without a subsidy itll be difficult to finance my long term rehabilitation it can be a heavy financial burden on the family
3234631 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3234632 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3234633 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3234634 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3234635 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3234636 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3234637 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3234638 no matter how you slice it the wii third party game story is not a pretty one
3234639 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3234640 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3234641 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3234642 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3234643 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3234644 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3234645 he had to take a shit and it was his god given right as the bartender to cut in line
3234646 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3234647 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3234648 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3234649 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3234650 i am delighted i couldnt care less about the time
3234651 an olympic gold is an olympic gold the time the race none of it matters its all about the gold
3234652 i looked at the crowd on the way to the race and made an effort to take it all in i was almost skipping i was so excited
3234653 it was the best time and a silver medal i couldnt ask for more
3234654 its been a great morning for the us three gold medals watching michael was really motivational
3234655 now you know how many managers it takes to change a lightbulb here two
3234656 oh i went there for lunch as opposed to dinner so my expectations are lower
3234657 is that how you are going to wear your hair
3234658 obamas campaign has hit a soft patch this summer with november just three months off it still appears an obama outcome in massachusetts is not in question but the margin certainly is
3234659 in presidential politics color new york state blue and throw away the crayons
3234660 oklahomans have their minds made up and they arent going to change come hell or high water no matter what
3234661 alaskans for obama a rare democratic push on the last frontier
3234662 obama and mccain are doing equally well in raiding the other partys base ten percent of 2004 kerry voters favor mccain while 13 percent of 2004 bush backers are with obama in order to close the gap mccain needs to do a little bit better winning back the democrats who voted for ronald reagan and their children
3234663 it would take an exceptional turnout from young voters and black voters as well as a lot of disaffected conservatives voting for bob barr
3234664 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3234665 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3234666 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3234667 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3234668 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3234669 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3234670 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3234671 the situation in tense but under control in the state capital and adjoining areas no untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the valley
3234672 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3234673 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3234674 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3234675 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3234676 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3234677 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3234678 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3234679 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3234680 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3234681 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3234682 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3234683 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3234684 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3234685 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3234686 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3234687 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3234688 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3234689 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3234690 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3234691 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3234692 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3234693 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3234694 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3234695 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3234696 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3234697 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3234698 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3234699 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3234700 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3234701 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3234702 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3234703 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3234704 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3234705 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3234706 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3234707 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent

3234709 with india we will build on the close partnership developed over the past decade as two of the worlds great multi ethnic democracies the us and india are natural strategic allies and we must work together to advance our common interests and to combat the common threats
3234710 we believe it is in the united states interest that all of these emerging powers and others assume a greater stake in promoting international peace and respect for human rights including through their more constructive participation in key global institutions
3234711 we are committed to us engagement in asia this begins with maintaining strong relationships with allies like japan australia south korea thailand and the philippines and deepening our ties to vital democratic partners like india in order to create a stable and prosperous asia
3234712 the chinese are too strong and the only opportunity for us is to wait for them to make a mistake
3234713 i am confident of bringing back two gold medals at the games
3234714 i will work hard on every dive instead of caring too much about results
3234715 a bouge chez magento la plateforme e commerce qui monte qui monte
3234716 ce qui me d range dans les d veloppements agiles cest justement quon parle de

3234718 the south korean vessel is now staying near the site as north korean patrol boats are searching for the missing the accident happened in north korean waters and our navy and maritime police vessels are on standby south of the sea border
3234719 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3234720 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3234721 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3234722 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3234723 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3234724 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3234725 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3234726 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3234727 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3234728 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3234729 the georgians must agree to sign agreements on the non use of force with the ossetians and with the abkhazians
3234730 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3234731 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3234732 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3234733 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3234734 a war is underway and our colleagues need to listen before consulting with their capitals and making decisions they need to listen to each party
3234735 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3234736 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3234737 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3234738 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3234739 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3234740 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3234741 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3234742 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3234743 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3234744 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3234745 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3234746 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3234747 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3234748 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3234749 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3234750 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3234751 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3234752 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3234753 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3234754 now that friday is over we need to examine the section 155 issue with some priority
3234755 we should also indicate to the dpp how we intend to assess the visy evidence against the criminal bill
3234756 rhetoric and nothing more than rhetoric empty rhetoric your honour
3234757 were calculated to deflect the investigation into his role in the cartel
3234758 there are probably several hours of testimony that have to be presented yet
3234759 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3234760 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3234761 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3234762 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3234763 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3234764 they dont quit its been a very good characteristic of this club we find a way late in games to do something to either win or make it very interesting
3234765 its gut wrenching but its good to watch them grow
3234766 he was making some valid points it did look like we were going through the motions he just let us know that wasnt acceptable its about being professional and playing nine innings
3234767 the first three innings it didnt seem like we were here
3234768 we didnt play very good baseball we werent focused but we got it back together and regrouped a little bit
3234769 i didnt want to let the team down after the fourth inning
3234770 hed been throwing a lot of balls and i wanted to work the count
3234771 i think that surprised him a fastball in that situation
3234772 you have a chance to redeem yourselves over nine innings
3234773 its different because we dont have the horses we did
3234774 it was raining and our bullpen was short and we needed somebody to pitch some innings for us bob walk said he could pitch and he kept coming to the dugout after the inning with rain dripping from his cap and snot dripping from his nose and saying he could go another inning
3234775 i doubt there was snot coming out of my nose
3234776 but i know there was rain dripping off my cap i can remember leyland would stop me before i went down the dugout steps to ask me how i felt he wouldnt even let me come in out of the rain
3234777 at that point in my career i would do anything to stay in the big leagues
3234778 it was real wet and the mound was a mess
3234779 every inning i came off the mound and leyland would ask me how are you
3234780 leyland saw that and he decided i at least had that on my side we got along pretty well after that
3234781 i know all those guys are looking forward to getting a look at their new home park
3234782 it will be a fun day for those guys it will almost be like opening day for them
3234783 i dont see any reason why he wont be able to play tonight
3234784 the first thing we do lets kill all the lawyers
3234785 the concern of course is that this information was released
3234786 this causes us serious concern what youve shown us are records that have very private information in them records that are confidential and certainly nothing that we would release
3234787 the concern of course is that this information was released
3234788 this causes us serious concern what youve shown us are records that have very private information in them records that are confidential and certainly nothing that we would release

3234790 are you with me because you like me or just because you cant bear to be alone
3234791 we expect to extend the scheme to karamoja region as well
3234792 god bless you in the powerful name of jesus christ

3234947 when the project was conceptualized it was conceptualized with a subsidy
3234948 you cant do any of this stuff without a subsidy none of it makes sense
3234949 there was a commitment when steve leeper was the sports amp exhibition authority director that there would be no additional taxpayer money used in the development between the stadiums somebody has decided to change that rule thats not surprising given everything thats happened in the past year on this land
3234950 given that they were able to purchase the land at one fifteenth of its value at some point we have to question why all the benefits are being given to one developer for one piece of land
3234951 right now the land is sitting there it is generating zero revenue except parking revenue for the sports amp exhibition authority the steelers will buy the land at a value determined six years ago they will put up an entertainment facility that will pay sales tax back to the state liquor taxes back to the state real estate taxes back to the city county and school district and income taxes back to the city and the state
3234952 the sum total of that will be an excellent return back to the state
3234953 make sure you get out and shoot for fun too
3234954 with todays technology and the tools we have its important to get information back out there again and hopefully clear an old case

3234956 this is a truly innocent victim were trying to provide some closure safety and solace to her
3234957 were reaching out to the community at large to try to get the final information that we need to hopefully close this investigation and yield some arrests

3234959 despite my acquittal it is easy to see that voters can have doubts about my character given what the media unfairly wrote about me
3234960 their tabloid like reporting has tarnished my reputation in this community and made it more difficult to seek re election
3234961 i am unwilling to put my family friends and supporters through the type of negative campaign that my opponent would likely conduct
3234962 i urged her to consider it and she said she would she just came off an election last year so she wants to talk to her family
3234963 but senator regola outlined his reasons for withdrawing and i did not try to dissuade him
3234964 he called me for counsel it was probably the toughest conversation ive had with anyone i will certainly miss him in the republican caucus
3234965 the attorney they hired has attempted to denigrate me in the press by misrepresenting my actions and most of the time outright lying about the facts of the case
3234966 if theres any distortion of the facts i would suggest its by the senator who has a fanciful or inaccurate recollection of what actually occurred
3234967 but the square footage is deceiving because there is so much packed into the store there is no inefficient use of space its spectacular we are now finally getting supermarkets back in the city

3235007 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3235008 would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia and these actions would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo of south ossetia that existed before fighting began

3235010 remove access to over 1 5 million books from one square mile of the city
3235011 it makes me think that long beach city manager pat west and possibly mayor bob foster do not understand the core mission of a civic library
3235012 the main library is one of the only things left in this city thats free
3235013 everybody needs to take step back and get the facts right
3235014 what if the bond measure fails what if they decide to build the new library someplace else
3235015 they are offering a temporary site but what will it look like how big will it be where will be located
3235016 a friend of mine works at the long beach library and she loves to talk about the lives it has uplifted over the past 20 years
3235017 the new library will be a lot smaller than the existing one
3235018 the one we have now is almost as big as the union bank building across the street
3235019 modern libraries given their access to the internet and other technologies are smaller and more efficient
3235020 each microchip has a scannable bar code that tells who owns it
3235021 the odds are that we wont microchip every plant but it will have a deterrent effect
3235022 the city decided to stop apologizing for the desert and said we live in the desert it is what it is
3235023 we have seized 15 to 20 barrels at a time
3235024 they have a very shallow root system and can be popped out pretty easily people have been digging them up in broad daylight
3235025 in some cases the thieves work for landscapers and in other cases they are independent contractors who sell the saguaro to legitimate commercial operations
3235026 depending on the size and shape or if it has arms they sell for anywhere from 500 to 5 000 or more each
3235027 once or twice a year we encounter people with shovels and pickup trucks trying to steal cactus
3235028 you can see the cumulative impact of 60 years of this kind of thing along some park roads where all of a sudden there are no barrel cactus
3235029 we dont have a problem with thefts anymore maybe because we have armed rangers patrolling everywhere
3235030 these are probably worth 150 or 200 each i think the economy is driving a lot of this if it isnt nailed down they are going to take it
3235031 we are trying to be in the forefront of water wise planting and are cutting down on our lush vegetation a lot of people are getting away from lawns and turf in favor of desert landscaping a golden barrel 3 or 4 feet across is worth 4 500 or more you pay by the inch
3235032 there has always been plant theft but now it has escalated
3235033 it is has increased because a landscaper has a job to do and with the slowdown in the economy he may look for cheaper prices i have heard that some of these thieves sell plants on street corners now
3235034 due to the lockups and withdrawal terms of the underlying funds liquidation is expected to take a substantial amount of time likely to be a year or longer

3235051 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3235052 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3235053 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3235054 this is a fantastic opportunity and i look forward to embracing laras world

3235062 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
3235063 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
3235064 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
3235065 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
3235066 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
3235067 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
3235068 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
3235069 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees
3235070 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
3235071 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
3235072 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word
3235073 in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
3235074 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
3235075 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
3235076 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
3235077 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
3235078 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
3235079 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
3235080 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
3235081 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
3235082 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
3235083 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir
3235084 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
3235085 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
3235086 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
3235087 the problem is that if youre not an olympic sport the money seems to go elsewhere
3235088 wed still get sport canada funding but thats one of two envelopes we depend on the other is olympic money wed probably be able to make up some of it through corporate sponsorship and through our alumni program but in a lot of countries youd see baseball just stroked off as a sport
3235089 its a bit like the national collegiate athletic association basketball tournament in that the further you go the more money you make
3235090 these are major league players theyre used to travelling a certain way
3235091 the main concern is the economy and the steep fall in demand
3235092 it seems that the weakness in the us economy has now spread to europe and asia and i think thats what the main concern is
3235093 investors have to realize that if the situation escalates the shutdown in the ports could last a long time and this could start affecting supplies
3235094 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3235095 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3235096 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3235100 its a major shift equivalent to the shift from black and white to colour ttv
3235101 its been a long process but we are there we had to wait for the international telecommunications union to agree on the different frequencies in the different regions before we could start the migration process
3235102 when we first started we thought it would cost r400 but because of the additional cherry on the ice cream we arrived at the price
3235103 we have put together bundles for people interested in 3g and voice contracts with one support infrastructure and one bill
3235104 all the phones we market to our customers provide internet access
3235105 we want to be seen as an alternative telecom player
3235106 we want to be seen as another neotel or telkom
3235107 there is space for more competitors at least another two or three depending on how spectrum allocation is done
3235108 we already have four or five organisations digging up the roads
3235109 the war that is taking place will happen with or without icasa the industry is not waiting for the regulator to cast pearls of wisdom anymore theyre just getting on with it

3235111 with the evolving telecoms market and people demanding cheaper telecoms and better service integr8 telecoms with their joint venture partners across africa have entered into the voip market
3235112 with inter connects and access to clients through our infrastructure it is now possible to change the normal tdm telkom client platform to a voip service with quality of service for better and cheaper phone calls no need for a client to change existing company pabx we integrate with all brands in the market
3235113 in essence integr8 will install a gateway behind the existing infrastructure of the client changing normal tdm services from the pabx into a voip solution
3235114 in telkoms view the biggest corporate retail deal in the history of the company warrants an event that celebrates in alignment with the brand
3235115 the corporate branded items were handed out to all guests corporate and media guests alike at the end of the vent
3235116 telkom does not believe that the ethics of our media stakeholders would be compromised by giving out corporate branded items as gifts
3235117 although the event was jointly hosted by telkom and absa telkom took the lead in handling the logistics of the event the gifts were not specifically targeted at the media but provided to all the guests and it served as a souvenir for this significant moment in these two companies relationship going forward
3235118 the police came by and we all know what happened

3235130 it means that well likely see vegetation shift a lot faster than we might think
3235131 the plant death was striking and occurred in most species
3235132 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3235133 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3235134 its starting to show the guy can still play football
3235135 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3235136 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3235137 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3235138 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3235139 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3235140 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3235141 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3235142 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3235143 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3235144 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3235145 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3235146 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3235147 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3235148 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3235149 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3235150 favre is not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3235151 i didnt believe those charges when they were leveled against him the first time
3235152 i had no hesitation in signing the letter for i believe in anwars innocence and importance to the needs of current history
3235153 anwar as a muslim leader for reform and change in malaysia has shown that under his leadership minorities can expect and will be protected
3235154 i dont know what they ahmadiyah believe but i care for their right to believe
3235155 we in nu are for the enforcement of islamic law in matters of family and personal law but we are not for an islamic state said gus dur
3235156 theres no obligation on the part of an indonesian muslim to be in favour of an islamic state that was what nu which is the largest islamic group in indonesia agreed to when it was consulted in the formulation of indonesias constitution in 1945
3235157 in later years nu also assented to the national ideology of pancasila which embeds pluralism into our culture
3235158 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3235159 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3235160 i hope it will do as much for olympic sports as ours in 1983 did for cricket
3235161 are you conscious of the consequences of deportation on families and on the economies of their home countries
3235162 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do
3235163 i said you know what you can inflate your tires to the proper levels and that if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would
3235164 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gages making fun of this idea as if this is barack
3235165 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to
3235166 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3235167 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3235168 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
3235169 two years from now you wont see them inside the site
3235170 we would love to see some action on capitol hill at reducing these credit card fees and that would bring the price down for sure
3235171 i dont even have a car anymore buses and bikes and a boyfriend with a car is all i need
3235172 weve seen a 200 to 300 percent in sales for may june and july of this year compared to last year which is phenomenal
3235173 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3235174 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3235175 some factories have replaced man power with machines especially in terms of fabric cutting in which fabrics are cut into small pieces at one time but everyone has different body shapes only tailored made clothes will be perfectly fit
3235176 it was a remarkable matter at that time he returned during the british colonial period wearing a suit used to be a habit of many foreign senior officials and envoys especially after world war ii thus grandpas shop became popular
3235177 i thought i would be able to prove my innocence and receive justice which is why i returned to thailand on feb 28 but the situation has deteriorated
3235178 the people are asking with this outcome that their leaders find a way to reach an accord
3235179 we reiterate our support for bolivias unity and territorial integrity and remain committed to be a good partner in bolivias journey to a more democratic prosperous future
3235180 evo should be declared president of all the indians of this continent
3235181 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating theyre needing to seek protection in australia
3235182 it might well be that at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection

3235192 they know what they need to do on a verification package and were continuing to work with them
3235193 this is not about one or two institutions we are now working with the other players in the industry
3235194 been and continues to cooperate fully with the regulators and has been working with clients since february to provide liquidity on a case by case basis
3235195 we think the banks are eager to resolve the matter
3235196 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last three to six years that has had an impact on the market
3235197 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3235198 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3235199 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so

3235202 the intent has always been to get them to sign off on it
3235203 it was never intended to be done without the consent of the mcneelys
3235204 not in my lifetime or my moms or my childrens
3235205 i feel that the community stepped up and voiced their opinions and i think its wonderful
3235206 you know what happened in birmingham changed the entire conscience of the world
3235207 now were focused on the weak demand side of the equation
3235208 there was this thought process that the high price of energy didnt matter to china and other countries but were finding that thats not the case
3235209 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3235210 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3235211 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3235212 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3235213 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3235214 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3235215 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3235216 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3235217 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3235218 we are not staying home with our children by default
3235219 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3235220 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3235221 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3235222 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3235223 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3235224 from circles around palazzo chigi nerve centre of direction of italian intelligence it is noted that the non authenticity of the video is testified from the fact that osama bin laden in it confessed that al qaeda would have been the author of the attack of the 11 september to the twin towers in new york while all of the democratic circles of america and of europe with in the forefront those of the italian centre left now know well that the disastrous attack was planned and realized by the american cia and mossad with the help of the zionist world to put under accusation the arabic countries and to persuade the western powers to intervene in iraq and afghanistan for this no word of solidarity arrived to silvio berlusconi who has been the author of the brilliant falsification neither from the quirinale nor from palazzo chigi nor from representatives of the centre left
3235225 at least calmed down we laid him down in time give me 100 000 and press them here take document to safe box for she never know
3235226 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3235227 you actually have neurons reconnecting from one cell to a different cell
3235228 this kind of dramatic rewiring happens predominantly if not exclusively in early development
3235229 the ability to rewire neurons in that physical way seems to become much harder with age
3235230 evolutionarily somehow it seems to be advantageous to stop that process to stabilize the networks in your head and go on with life
3235231 it indicates that the sensory organs in the periphery the eyes at the front of the head have a mechanism to tell the brain when the eyes are ready and actually seeing something meaningful
3235232 every sensory system has some kind of message to send to the brain to make it plastic at some time
3235233 start to tell us how external information can directly affect molecular mechanisms of the brain
3235234 there are still many more studies that need to be done to understand plasticity in other parts of the brain and how to translate it to human problems
3235235 it was an incredibly resourceful competitive environment the wave of captains i was privileged to serve with fed off of each others experiments
3235236 all we had done up to that point was put people in jail and it hadnt made a difference
3235237 the new concept was know everything you possibly can about crime what i took away from that period was that by challenging yourself continually to know what you dont know you can produce big results
3235238 i was ready to move on until i saw what director cordero brought on board
3235239 im embarrassed to say that in 2000 we didnt know how to connect the dots we were just reacting to crime the director gave us the knowledge and the confidence to actually fight it
3235240 youd be surprised what people will tell you when youre out of your car that they wont call the department about
3235241 huge organizational change in how officers work on the street
3235242 the new model is when a cop is not answering a radio call he should be back in his zone engaged in proactive policing
3235243 if a citizen reports a problem and an officer doesnt see and act on it then it becomes clear to me that he is not enthusiastic about his job
3235244 were not looking to see if an officer is having a cup of coffee
3235245 theres 70 000 people i care about i dont fear disgruntled cops
3235246 in 2004 we did 6 389 directed patrols and we thought we were working in 2007 we did almost half a million

3235489 the consumer will suffer because two competitors are better than one
3235490 when you have a monopoly it generally leads to higher prices and less innovation in terms of technology you dont have to be as scrappy when you dont have a competitor
3235491 the jury is still out on whether even one satellite radio company can survive these companies have been racking up some pretty substantial losses year in and year out
3235492 one of the arguments we made in opposing the merger was why would the government want to bail out two companies that made really bad business decisions

3235555 so this is an opportunity for the community to help plan the future of their suburb
3235556 that will involve making decisions about whats appropriate in what locations

3235601 the thirteen clocks is one of the cleverest fairytales that any modern writer has been able to tell there is no living author who moves about in fairyland with such wit and easy familiarity
3235602 its one of the great kids books of the last century it may be the best thing thurber ever wrote its certainly the most fun that anybody can have reading anything aloud
3235603 there are spys monsters betrayals escapes spells to be broken and all the usual accouterments but thurber gives the proceedings his own particular deadpan spin it all makes for a rousing concoction of adventure humor and satire that defies any conventional classification
3235604 my exemplary thurber fairy tale is the 13 clocks a small masterpiece of respectful travesty honors the whole spectrum of the traditions
3235605 rich with ogres and oligarchs riddles and wit what distinguishes the 13 clocks is not just quixotic imagination but thurbers inimitable delight in language the stories beg to be read aloud thurber captivates the ear and captures the heart

3235731 weve definitely found the best way to write songs for trivium
3235732 initially we demoed twenty songs but actually had closer to thirty thirty five maybe label roadrunner doesnt mind because you never know one song might have a riff thats killer its always good to have surplus of extra music because down the road you might take it and turn it into something else
3235733 probably the best show was in australia its a good way to pinpoint just one of the best the first show we did in australia was in the gold coast at the big day out it was our first show ever in australia and thousands of kids were chanting our names it was an awesome moment we knew then that we had a pretty big impact on thousands of kids miles from our home it was an incredible moment we hit the stage and it just went off
3235734 we didnt really fit the bill but dillinger are cool dudes theyre a great band and they treated us well but we just werent connecting with the crowd for the week no one would get on the main part of the floor there was a gigantic rectangular gap in the middle it was a very very odd feeling weve never had that since then but i think it was just that no one knew who we were
3235735 we just made our shows more intense sometimes youve gotta fight for it
3235736 well i think people are going to see the gigantic leap we made from
3235737 we flew out and just it hit off and knew that we were gonna get the energy that we wanted we wanted to capture the energy that a trivium live show has and that was just the main thing to find what trivium is and capture it on an album it wasnt easy but we had the time demo ing and rehearsing it and all the hard work paid off
3235738 we got tons of art inside the booklet there is artwork for each of the songs its a very artistic booklet and it will make it to our staging and all that sort of stuff its kinda hard to describe its different from the crusade and ascendancy which had a central figure it doesnt have that its very epic is probably the best way to describe it without taking twenty minutes
3235739 were doing press out in australia and thought that if were gonna fly thirteen hours to do press we may as well do a show and play some of the new material well gladly do a tour but at the moment we dont have time we are coming back though and are gonna do a full tour of the country
3235740 just thank you for the support youve given trivium every tour has been huge and the response has been great it took us a lot to get down there but its worth the wait were gonna come back with every album hopefully multiple times
3235741 my fault i warned you not to touch any of the plants with the crimson flowers
3235742 i thought you meant the ones with the funny little curly cues coming out of the middle
3235743 no those were more a sort of vermillion color i meant the ones with the triangular petals
3235744 i only touched the flower its the growths near the base of the stem that youve got to watch out for
3235745 and if you knew that it could explode then you should have known that it sets like cement as it dries
3235746 well to be fair i did have other things on my mind getting out of there before some of the local wildlife turned up to investigate for example some of the predators native to this planet use the sound of that explosion to alert them when potential preys about believe me you wouldnt want to still be there when a vinidik showed up theyre twice the size of a grizzly bear and about half as friendly
3235747 soon itll start raining the water will rehydrate this stuff and unstick us well be able to get inside the tardis and everything will be just hunky dory
3235748 remind me to add that to the list of words never to use again
3235749 meteorology isnt precisely an exact science you know is it really so terrible being stuck with me
3235750 not at first but about two and a half hours ago i realized that i really need to visit the loo
3235751 you know what im gonna do once i get all cleaned up
3235752 im gonna grab a flamethrower and torch every one of those snot flowers within a ten mile radius
3235753 rose marion tyler im surprised at you since when do you advocate the destruction of innocent plant life just because you had a bad experience besides
3235754 since ive spent the last three hours sitting on the rocky ground covered in this disgusting snot thats since when im cold im hungry im tired my hand is cramping up from not moving my bladder feels like its about to burst and i smell ill use an aerosol can and a lighter if i have to but ill be avenged on those flowers
3235755 im sorry rose theres not much i can do about most of that theres a banana in my pocket but its sealed up just like everything else i think i can make you a bit more comfortable though cmere
3235756 yeah noticed that thanks knew they had to be time travellers the timelines around them look like a cross between a corkscrew and a pretzel messy
3235757 an bein human and in this century that makes them either agents or rogues and they look too spit an polish to be rogue you know them captain they after you
3235758 they dont seem to be noticing me any good hunter can pretend indifference but i really dont think theyre here for me
3235759 doctor we may lack your time senses but the agency has some pretty sophisticated chronon detectors
3235760 kiddie toys sides im shieldin theyre not gonna detect anything i dont want them to detect
3235761 they suspect used an agency hand code i tried a bluff whatever happens just stay out of it they probably think youre a small time smuggler or someone like that beneath their notice
3235762 theyll be very happy to see you back at headquarters youve become an annoyance it was a mistake to get too ambitious shouldve kept your cons small like the other gutter rats
3235763 youll be turned over to station security if they dont have anything on you youll be released we have no interest in you
3235764 an its got a lot to do with me im the one thats gonna have to explain to rose why youre not on board the tardis when i go to pick her up shell be unhappy an then jackie will be angry an im not havin jackie tyler angry at me if i can help it im also the one thats gonna have to re align all the gravitic stabilizers without help so dont think you can go swannin off with these two an not have me say somethin about it
3235765 you need to talk to who the hell do you think i am your messenger boy
3235766 i think youre a time agency flunky with barely enough authority to decide what sort of jam to put on your toast in the morning youre not cleared for this sonny boy your supervisor probably isnt either but thatll be a start
3235767 explain to your smuggler friend that hes not helping you any by messing in time agency business
3235768 we dont call in a district supervisor to talk to every whinging petty criminal mister
3235769 just the doctor and theres nothin petty about me sonny boy you can tell your district supervisor that i have a confirmation code for him now he wont be cleared for it so ill just give you the middle five characters aleph four gimel six omicron got that hell probably have to bounce it up a couple of levels to find someone who is cleared so to speed things up tell him its department 391 business all right
3235770 ill take the responsibility go back to the ship contact district
3235771 well doctor it seems that there actually is such a code but its not quite the one they were expecting
3235772 the records indicate that there should be some kind of physical component
3235773 there is an ive got it safely tucked away i wont be getting it out until im face to face with someone who has the authority to give me what i want
3235774 i want my crewman released an a guarantee that this wont happen again the next time i run into some of your trigger happy goons
3235775 your crewman is a disgraced time agent and a wanted criminal you cant possibly have any information thats valuable enough to make the agency overlook his offences
3235776 just gotta be willin to take the consequences you willin to take the consequences of your choices sonny
3235777 colonel josiah quintrell time agency youve had my archives department spinning like quarks for the past few hours doctor archivists get terribly agitated when you ask them to gather information on someone who doesnt exist
3235778 im not tinker bell colonel i wont blink out of existence jus because you refuse to believe in time lords
3235779 i believe in time lords doctor theres enough evidence if you dig deeply enough i dont believe that youre one
3235780 an the bioscan that you ran jus before you came in
3235781 that you have two hearts proves nothing mutant surgery gene mods maybe even some kind of mixed breed doesnt matter there havent been any time lords for centuries
3235782 you strike me as a busy man colonel too busy to come traipsin across the galaxies to speak to a fairy tale so if there arent any time lords what brought you all this way
3235783 maybe i want to believe in at least one impossible thing before breakfast
3235784 took a chronon reading off you that was way off the scale but his sensor is a field unit maybe its malfunctioning this is a lab model freshly calibrated
3235785 right chronon reading that exactly matches his official logged temporal transit hours
3235786 might as well calculate interstellar travel in furlongs per fortnight
3235787 artron energy can barely be sensed let alone measured accurately
3235788 golvani dont make me laugh thats humans for you muckin about with stuff they cant detect let alone control an then makin up laws to hide how much they dont know
3235789 but since that is the best that you lot can do recalibrate it to decades stead of years
3235790 something has to be wrong a millennium it cant be
3235791 lying about your age doc you keep saying youre only nine hundred
3235792 close enough i dont live a very linear existence got other things to keep track of an dont call me doc
3235793 im a practical man i believe in gravity newtons third law and the doctor
3235794 assuming for arguments sake that you are a time lord your confirmation code doesnt match youre not cia
3235795 ive done a few jobs for the celestial intervention agency
3235796 quit stallin colonel you know who youre dealin with now its time to deal
3235797 as i understand it you want this man currently calling himself harkness released to your custody
3235798 more or less i want jack harkness currently servin as my crewman officially assigned to me an i want the agency off his back
3235799 yknow i remember when the time agency was founded the high council debated whether you lot should be allowed to fiddle about with time travel it was a narrow thing but the cia argued that you might be useful maybe its time to reconsider that decision
3235800 are you proposing to declare war on the time agency
3235801 not war colonel an you should be very grateful for that you dont want to see how i wage war you really dont nah im jus thinkin that maybe i should suspend your licence those gimcrack ships of yours are easy enough to disable
3235802 but i dont think the doctor has any particular plans for the next few centuries
3235803 i was really hoping that we could settle this in a friendly way doctor if you think so little of agency technology then perhaps you would be prepared to share some of your peoples advances
3235804 this is kelosite a mineral that attracts chronon particles under the right conditions its luminescent you jus have to reach inside the stone an excite the chronon particles
3235805 a simple teaching tool my people used to give them to children of six or seven to help stimulate their time senses catch
3235806 i know what sorts of things you had in mind colonel master the kelosite an i might
3235807 this is absurd the cia is long gone your claim has no legal basis
3235808 this man is joined to me and mine my hand is placed over him in protection in all places an in all times for the rest of my lives
3235809 it means that jack harkness is mine colonel and that the time agency has no more claim to him go tell your superiors an be very very sure that they believe you if the agency interferes again with me or mine i will shut it down
3235810 i cant speak for the agency but i will convey your message i think i can make them understand the situation
3235811 see that you do well be leavin now dont try to follow us
3235812 colonel you can keep the kelosite but there are some things i didnt tell you about it
3235813 the stronger you are the brighter it gets an if you get strong enough you dont need to be touchin it
3235814 that was quite a speech you made back there doctor some of it sounded almost like a ritual
3235815 yeah took it from a house binding never mind dunno why i used the old words meant them though you belong on the tardis
3235816 it sounded like you were saying that i belonged to you
3235817 what i said was that you were mine to protect the words bind me not you
3235818 and that was some bluff you pulled i think quintrell bought it hell i nearly bought it myself
3235819 theyve been getting too big for their boots for a few centuries needed talkin to
3235820 time we were goin to get rose spose jackie will want us to stay for tea an rose will talk of nothin but girlie stuff for days
3235821 i shouldnt have used those words shouldve left them in the past but i wasnt thinkin clearly
3235822 the other half of that ritual would bind you all right obedience an service an obligation for life i dont want that from anyone specially you
3235823 already chosen you hadnt i did that a while back the difference between a claim an a choice is that choosin has to be on both sides
3235824 youre free to choose jack you can choose to be on the tardis with rose an me an you can choose to go

3235848 billys a tough guy hes a street guy a pittsburgh guy
3235849 weve talked about it both of our tackles are a concern
3235850 it is not the slightest bit involving and is sadly lacking not only in substance but also in basic narrative structure it is hard to make poetry out of confusion
3235851 im sure youre asked this a lot but what are cosmic rays
3235852 theyre repositioning to a place safe and far enough to prevent exchanges of gunfire from both sides
3235853 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like the way they are being treated
3235854 i think the biggest problem is not the young people its squarely the police
3235855 i think its important we have this sentiment of security and the only way we can have it is by being very transparent in the investigation that will be put forward by the minister of public security
3235856 i was very clear with him this morning that this has to be done as soon as possible and the information will be made public
3235857 were there to listen to understand what happened yesterday sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations
3235858 if they dont change their tactics they run risk of instigating a significant rupture with the community
3235859 the youngsters of the neighbourhood will feel under surveillance more so than they already are
3235860 i feel very upset and im not going to tolerate what happened on the weekend
3235861 they were damaged and puddle jumping and taking off thats what they were doing
3235862 you have some newspaper reports that say the army captured the saucer but as far as the case itself the official standing on the roswell case is that it didnt happen
3235863 a condition a situation or a state of being of a group of persons characterized by an advanced degree of confusion that has not quite reached panic proportions
3235864 there were thousands of people who saw these things up and down the east coast
3235865 what i did was to figure out the flight path trajectories i worked with all types of people aeronautical people pilots astronomers scientists jet people police officers air force people they helped and assisted me by putting this whole mess of sightings together
3235866 and over all the years researching the story it just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger
3235867 by using the blue book as my primary source i would go into local newspapers and just pick up the trails when i figured out what direction these ufos were flying i would go from the baltimore area and through maryland west virginia and ohio and i picked up the trail these ufos were flying that night
3235868 there were 10 actual crash landings that night in west virginia
3235869 theyre all documented this is what took 17 years to figure out
3235870 i suppose if you went digging through some of these areas you might find something
3235871 i actually re drove and re enacted that whole night driving all through braxton county
3235872 it took me years to do it it was a cold case and i reconstructed it
3235873 well you know what do you want me to do i cant control everything
3235874 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3235875 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3235876 let it be a u n mandated international force ideally eu
3235877 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3235878 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3235879 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3235880 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3235881 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3235882 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity john mccain and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington games
3235883 it was a pleasure meeting you you do a great job at making everyone feel like they have known you for years i heard from many people at the wedding that they thought you were great
3235884 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3235885 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3235951 politi ki svakako re o nekorektnom neprimerenom i tetnom potezu
3235952 odluka predsednika sad d ord a bu a da odobri isporuku vojne opreme nezavisnom kosovu zaslu uje pa nju i to nije korak u dobrom smeru to je pogre na stvar
3235953 kosovu u ovom momentu sigurno ne treba dodatno naoru anje koliko su mu potrebni traktori seme kole obdani ta radna mesta
3235954 mislim da bi takva pomo stanovni tvu kosova u ovom momentu bila mnogo primerenija ako imamo u vidu da je konflikt iza nas i da je ovo postkonfliktni period
3235955 ne verujem da to bitno remeti vojni balans u regionu i to ne predstavlja direktno vojnu pretnju srbiji bilo bi uostalom jako lo e kada bi naoru avanje dve i po hiljade ljudi predstavljalo direktnu ili trenutnu oru anu pretnju srbiji
3235956 politi ki je to svakako neprimeren gest tetan gest odlaze e ameri ke administracije ili bolje da ka em dela te administracije pre svega mo da nekoliko ljudi koji zavr avaju posao zapo et jo za vreme klintonove administracije
3235957 da je takav gest pre svega kompenzacija za sporu ili sporu u odnosu na o ekivanu dinamiku priznavanja samoprogla ene nezavisnosti kosova
3235958 mo da je to kompenzacija i smirivanje ekstremista na kosovu ali to je kratkovido i dugoro no ne nosi ni ta dobro
3235959 u ovom momentu nema potrebe za dodatnim poja anim anga ovanjem a jedan od razloga to to ne radimo je i na a namera da svojim aktivnostima ne odvla imo pa nju sa problema na kosovu i metohiji kojima kfor i unmik treba da se posvete
3235960 nivo poverenja koji smo izgradili u prethodnom periodu omogu ava da se tako pona amo
3235961 saradnja vs i kfora je pre svega vezana za odnose du administrativne linije i u tom pogledu nije bilo naru avanja na e saradnje
3235962 i dalje vrlo korektna i u skladu sa me unarodno preuzetim obavezama sa obe strane
3235963 za vreme de avanja koja su usledila nakon jednostranog progla enja nezavisnosti kosova bio u redovnom kontaktu sa komandantom kfora generalom gzavije bo de marnakom
3235964 razmenjivali smo informacije u nekoliko navrata smo se i savetovali ta je mudro da se radi u takvoj situaciji i to je bilo dobro a ta vrsta komunikacije je ishod prethodno uspostavljenog poverenja i ugleda koji vs ima po tuju i me unarodno potpisane sporazume i obaveze koje srbija ima
3235965 prilikom de avanja 17 marta komandantu kfora ukazao da su doga aji u severnom delu kosovske mitrovici pokazali da su izabrani lo e vreme i lo a metodologija za izvedenu akciju i da je bilo elemenata prekomerne upotrebe sile
3235966 u isto vreme i agresivan nastup gra ana prema pripadnicima kfora i unmik a nije ne to to ide u prilog na im interesima jer srbe na kosovu u ovom momentu nema ko drugi da titi osim me unarodnih snaga koje su tamo u sklopu mandata un to mi priznajemo i prihvatamo
3235967 va no je da ne pravimo dodatni tro ak uvaju i ono to nam objektivno ne treba i dr e i u vojsci opremu koja jednostavno vi e nije odgovaraju a za odgovor na nove bezbednosne izazove sa kojima se suo avamo
3235968 zato i grupisali tehniku koja nam ne treba i da ne to od toga ne e mo i da se proda
3235969 neka stara sredstva poput tenkova t 55 svakako nisu hit na me unarodnom tr i tu naoru anja i vojne opreme
3235970 mo da ozbiljniji problem u ovom momentu su vi kovi municije i minsko eksplozivnih sredstava kojima su zatrpana na a skladi ta to je jedan od ozbiljnijih bezbednosnih izazova sa kojima se suo ava srbija a i mnoge druge zemlje
3235971 problem sa mlaznim gorivom je prevazi en zahvaljuju i izme u ostalog anga ovanju aktuelnog menad menta ministarstva odbrane i taj problem vi e ne postoji na i piloti sada mogu da lete dovoljno
3235972 tu su i radarski sistemi gde imamo nekoliko generacija radara a koje uz izvesne modifikacije mo emo da koristimo to je sve deo koncepta koji sada razvijamo tzv centra za kontrolu suvereniteta vazdu nog prostora potrebno je da to bude uvezan sistem po ugledu na moderne evropske vojske
3235973 ali nije realno da emo mo i da u emo u nabavku pre 2011 2012
3235974 nije unapredila od momenta kada je srbija u la u taj program i da je to teta
3235975 njihovo progla enje namere da kosovu isporu e oru je mo e a i ne mora da zna i da e se i obistiniti ako se tako ne to i desi mi smo tu da procenimo situaciju
3235976 nisam politi ar a to su politi ke odluke ako ovo oru je i do e ima e verovatno neku vrstu legalnog toka odnosno bi e nadgledano za razliku od oru ja koje se ilegalno nalazi na kosovu
3235977 kfor ima svoju ulogu znam da ima odre enih problema u smislu slobode kretanja ali taj problem moraju re avati po ednako sve zajednice na kosovu najve a odgovornost po pitanju slobode kretanja le i na kosovskim albancima odnosno vladi kosova koja treba da ubedi stanovni tvo da je sloboda kretanja mogu a za sve

3235993 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3235994 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3235995 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3235996 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3236001 aku pernah mendengar al qasim ditanya di mina beliau menjawab saya tidak tahu saya tidak mengerti
3236002 aku pernah mendengar al qasim berkata kami tidak bisa mengetahui segala persoalan yang ditanyakan kepada kami apabila seseorang sudah menunaikan kewajibannya terhadap allah lalu ia hidup sebagai orang bodoh itu lebih baik daripada ia mengatakan sesuatu yang tidak ia ketahui
3236003 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3236017 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
3236018 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies and while a misleading portrait of mr obama is being perpetrated by a media controlled by the democrats the obama camp has sent out people to attack the greatness of sen john mccain whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend

3236101 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3236102 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3236103 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3236104 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3236105 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3236106 this is a planning took where all things are going
3236107 remember that accidents exist remember that accidental deaths happen daily in our country do not continue your anti woman and homophobic campaign death to traitors death to those who oppose the nation death or revolution
3236108 clearly these attempts at intimidation go beyond death threats to cruelty and blasphemy
3236109 anyone who doubts the criminal diabolical nature of the international abortion lobby needs look no further
3236110 these threats just confirm what we have always known about the promoters of abortion they are violent and deadly
3236111 we categorically condemn any threats of violence against our affiliate and we stand with the valiant priests and bishops in ecuador who are bravely defending the right to life against systematic campaigns and intrusion from foreign influences trying to impose western pro abortion values on latin america
3236112 happily never after how hollywood favors adultery and promiscuity over marital intimacy on prime time broadcast television
3236113 these study results suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner
3236114 even more troubling than the marginalization of marriage and glorification of non marital sex on television is tvs recent obsession with outr outrageous sexual expression
3236115 behaviors that were once seen as fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the stamp of approval by the television industry and recent studies show that children are influenced by those messages
3236116 throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
3236117 statistics show that the overwhelming majority of americans feel satisfied and fulfilled by their marriages the notion that sex outside of marriage is inherently more exciting more important more worthy as the subject of story telling is a toxic message for parents and children alike
3236118 must exercise greater responsibility when handling sexual situations during primetime hours opting for less graphic visual content and favoring storylines that dont celebrate promiscuity glamorize criminality or denigrate monogamy
3236119 while the supreme court awaits its next legal review of indecency on television now is the time for families to raise their collective voice against the tide of graphic sexual content invading their homes
3236120 sorry i couldnt cut that short it was rachel corries father
3236121 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3236122 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3236123 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3236124 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3236125 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3236126 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3236127 basically what ctp does is that it eliminates the need for film and chemical proofs by utilizing pdf files
3236128 the ctp technology avoids all the pre plate making process as all of the papers in digital from will be directly used to make plates saving costs and the time pre plate making requires
3236129 it is not only the three hours time we will save but while filming the paper we usually encounter problems for instance when the picture resolution is good it diminishes the quality of the text and sometimes the reverse happens now we can bring all of our pages on a single cd and plates will be made with that

3236131 so it doesnt necessarily pay to go out much beyond 30 to 36 months
3236132 the further out you go the better your crystal ball needs to be as to exactly what you are going to be running three to four years from now
3236133 have you heard anything in all these months of the isis usual political manoeuvres and background pressures
3236134 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
3236135 but i feel like it actually decreases the quality of games because people spend so much of their energy on these things that users dont even really care about
3236136 what would keep me from putting another game on arcade again is just that theyve changed the business deal at least as ive heard if its as ive heard that it is i couldnt even necessarily break even
3236137 the continuous decline of the cpi is a positive sign as it shows the governments measures to ease inflationary pressures were effective

3236146 we are pulling out all the stops to deliver a more efficient package for customers who need the capability of full size pickups and suvs and want the very best fuel economy
3236147 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
3236148 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
3236149 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving

3236153 i think people are a little bit cautious but also the people ive spoken to are hopeful that this will turn into the next big mine in the area
3236154 that is the choice that is the arsenal of candidates seeking to succeed olmert none speak in the name of any ideology whatsoever a past prime minister who failed at his post and brought about the second intifada barak a former chief of staff and defence minister a cruel military man who fanned the flames and knows only how to sow destruction and death mofaz a mild mannered foreign minister who has not advanced peace in any way livni and netanyahu the person everyone loves to hate no worse than his fellow candidates but immeasurably more persecuted the media embraces livni accepts mofaz as legitimate sometimes supports barak but is terrified only by netanyahu why
3236155 what was essential and therefore justified in the pre state days is now assuming an ugly and violent form of colonial occupation the authoritarian regime in the territories the creation of two legal systems the placing of the army and police at the service of the settlement movement the robbing of palestinian lands
3236156 if society does not find the emotional strength to remove the noose of the settlements nothing but a sad memory will remain of the jewish state as it still exists
3236157 mired in delays a shortage of resources and differences between israelis and the americans over what military capabilities those forces should have once deployed in the territories
3236158 perhaps most worrying of all is that as palestinians lose hope in the peace process and look despairingly at both the fatah and hamas leaderships there is a danger of extremist al qaeda style alternatives emerging such activity may already be taking place today as politics breaks down into clan structures and groups like the army of islam appear hamas is not al qaeda but the alternative to it might be

3236261 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3236262 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3236270 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3236271 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3236272 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3236273 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3236274 we have no need to buy opposition mnas for our impeachment move we will stay in the ambit of the constitution in our historic battle for the supremacy of parliament
3236275 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3236328 it was a horrible time period and we felt awful but im buying a building that hasnt been kept up properly for 50 years im clear that were responsible its not always easy to make up for 50 years of deferred maintenance

3236330 he not only chopped everything down he bulldozed the roots
3236331 we are only expecting to sell the 13 or 14 apartments that are vacant or are already at market rents
3236332 if stuy town turns out not to be able to return that value that would probably make a lot of banks think twice about lending in such situations
3236333 he doesnt want me here because my presence is an obstacle hes about to sell our apartments from under our feet
3236334 theyve not rented to a black or working class person
3236335 the new tenants are 99 percent white this is a perpetuation of the historic alienation of black people in harlem
3236336 there are very few black people who can afford this
3236337 i like the idea of people of different backgrounds living in the same building
3236338 i think thats a more worthwhile way of providing affordable housing
3236339 a lot of these buildings were absolutely horrible harlem was begging for private investment going back to the 50s i happen to think that harlem is a healthier community than it has been one reason for that is the amount of investment
3236340 surely theyre not in the business of maintaining affordable housing permanently
3236341 furniture like pieces add ons that help transform the space itself or make it work in a different way

3236345 its cool to bring something to life whether its a song or a video but to do it and have it embraced by millions like lost thats insane
3236346 i worked hardest to bring the tech and content communities together it is happening
3236347 i got the chance to put washington and silicon valley together we are seeing an apollo project of a new kind of politics being built right now
3236348 there has been a lot of focus on us but we have been cool about it we did not do anything special as part of preparation for the games we kept mostly to our normal routines
3236349 the olympics are big but we try to treat it as just another event it helps deflect the pressure we did not want to make it hard on ourselves by doing something different or getting into the hype of things we hang out just how it was before
3236350 everyone knows that south korea are the heavy favourites in the womens event but it could be anyones game for the men there is always a new winner in the individual event from different countries that is how close it is in the mens competition
3236351 currently we are ranked at number four in the world everyone says that we have a better chance in the team than the individual but i think we have chances in both the events
3236352 it all depends on how we handle ourselves on that day so far our preparation had been good and we are looking forward to the games we do not want to be so worried about the results we just want to have fun over there
3236353 we had match practices everyday with the professional archers the quality of training was high the koreans trains around the clock and it was good to be stretched to the limit
3236354 marbawi khalmizam and i have been together for a while now we can work well as a team
3236355 the most important thing is that we are supportive of each other this will be important as we try to achieve good results in the olympics
3236356 the team have improved a lot since coming under the charge of south korean coach lee jae hyung he is a dedicated coach
3236357 we are going in with a medal chance but there is the luck element that we must not forget sometimes external factors like windy conditions can be a stumbling block but our boys have prepared well to face any conditions and we hope that they will be able to stand up to the challenges

3236374 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3236375 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3236376 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3236377 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3236378 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3236379 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3236380 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3236381 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3236382 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3236383 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3236384 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3236385 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3236386 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3236387 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3236388 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3236389 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3236390 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3236391 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3236393 my best for now of my morning swims i hope to swim something like that tomorrow morning or even a little faster my dreams are going to come true and i am going to stand on the podium
3236394 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for me to see the others
3236395 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew tae hwan was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3236396 it means a lot to win my first individual medal and on a stage like this it is awesome
3236397 when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake it was a very fast time when i saw the 1 by my name i thought they had made a mistake then i saw my name first and i realized that id got it
3236398 this is my first olympic medal so i am very pleased i think its inspiring to watch people break records it sets the bar higher and its a great pool so its very motivating no i wont be celebrating tonight ive got a race in 2 days so ill be going to bed and getting my rest
3236399 it didnt matter who was 1 we just wanted to go 1 and 2 i looked up and saw matt next to me i was elated stuff like that is like a dream come true i remember what it felt like after the 100 in athens i broke down and that will probably happen here it is just as wonderful as the first time
3236400 thats how i think of it im very happy with that i raced the best i could have hoped for not only is it a great venue but the pool is really deep and its a good temperature its also the olympics and you come to compete you are not just representing yourself but your country as well so you push yourself harder its special to go 1 2 so i am very happy to accomplish that
3236401 i didnt think i would get a medal i just came in here to have fun so im happy
3236402 records are always going to happen the new suits play a little part but it comes down to hard training and we all want to win records are made to be broken im really looking forward to the 200 back now
3236403 going out there there was a fair bit of pressure i havent lost the 100 breast in 4 years and after athens i learned to handle the pressure differently so im really excited
3236404 in recent years the web browser has increasingly become targeted as an infection vector for vulnerable hosts
3236405 attacks against web browsers depend upon malicious content being rendered by the appropriate built in interpreter e g html javascript css etc or vulnerable plug in technology e g flash quicktime java etc 1 2 vulnerabilities lying within these rendering technologies are then exposed to any exploit techniques or malicious code developed by the attacker vulnerability trend reports have indicated that remotely exploitable vulnerabilities have been increasing since the year 2000 and reached 89 4 of vulnerabilities reported in 2007 3 a growing percentage of these remotely exploitable vulnerabilities are associated with web browsers
3236406 in the face of a more hostile environment most commercial vendors ofweb browser technologies have made progress over recent years in making their products more resilient to common security threats dropping insecure features and strengthening others their development life cycles have matured and typically encompass multiple levels of secure design and vulnerability testing as well as new processes for promptly handling externally discovered flaws as such most updates and patches for existing web browser technologies both the core browsing engine and third party plug ins increasingly incorporate new and vital security fixes a trend that is expected to continue in to the future
3236407 for years the software industry has promoted one security best practice over all others always use the most recent version of the installed software and instantly apply the latest patches with todays hostile internet and drive by download attack vectors failure to apply patches promptly or missing them entirely is a recipe for disaster exposing the host to infection and possibly subsequent data disclosure or loss

3236410 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3236411 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3236412 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3236413 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3236414 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3236415 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3236416 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3236417 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3236418 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3236419 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3236420 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3236421 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3236422 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3236423 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3236424 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3236425 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3236428 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3236429 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3236430 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3236431 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3236432 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3236433 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3236434 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3236435 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3236436 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3236437 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3236438 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3236439 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3236440 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3236441 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3236442 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3236443 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3236444 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3236445 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3236446 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3236447 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3236448 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3236449 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3236450 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3236451 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3236452 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3236453 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3236454 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3236455 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3236456 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3236457 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3236458 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3236459 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3236460 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3236461 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3236462 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3236463 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3236464 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3236465 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3236466 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3236467 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3236468 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3236469 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3236470 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3236471 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3236472 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3236473 who are open to doing something on the production side
3236474 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3236475 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3236476 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

3236666 david becomes my trusty sidekick starship on the front lawn of my identity mechanism startlingly cohesive for a flurry of unfulfilled desire his ability to imbue random imagery with a plasticity of meaning gives his wriggle purpose beyond the usual post reproductive fade out the interior wall of his presentation is fantastic collage of heretofore unseen worlds that have small basis in his day to day experience yet these phantasms are the very product one seeks to experience when one is beyond form but not the interpretation thereof this unique circumstance serves his masters purpose well

3236738 each evening the streetlights came on at dusk and the view out the window changed from barely glowing kitchens and tv rooms to the houses that contained them and to the trees that sheltered the houses it seemed to sarabeth that for a little while there was a kind of balance out there an equilibrium but then quickly darkness came down from the sky and soon the lit rooms returned to prominence and finally everything else was black and the world seemed limited to a few bright windows on a street in palo alto
3236739 the thirteen clocks is one of the cleverest fairytales that any modern writer has been able to tell there is no living author who moves about in fairyland with such wit and easy familiarity

3236741 there are spys monsters betrayals escapes spells to be broken and all the usual accouterments but thurber gives the proceedings his own particular deadpan spin it all makes for a rousing concoction of adventure humor and satire that defies any conventional classification
3236742 my exemplary thurber fairy tale is the 13 clocks a small masterpiece of respectful travesty honors the whole spectrum of the traditions
3236743 rich with ogres and oligarchs riddles and wit what distinguishes the 13 clocks is not just quixotic imagination but thurbers inimitable delight in language the stories beg to be read aloud thurber captivates the ear and captures the heart

3236750 japanese barbarism rendered the battle for manila a human catastrophe but macarthurs obsession with seizing the city created the circumstances for it macarthur presided over the largest ground campaign of americas war in the pacific in a fashion which satisfied his own ambitions more convincingly than the national purpose of his country
3236751 the myth that the japanese were ready to surrender anyway has been so comprehensively discredited by modern research that it is astonishing some writers continue to give it credence

3236755 but how if there is such an event can it be remembered afterwards how can it be expressed in anything but itself not only from the unbeliever are the mysteries hid but the adept himself cannot retain them he may think if he chooses that he has been with god but as soon as he thinks it it becomes history and falls under the rules of time

3236760 the new windfall profits tax proposed is good for us independent oil operators
3236761 in the 1987 the multinationals and opec got together to drive down the price of oil and force smaller independents out of business so they could come back and raise prices once most of us were out of business

3236763 this big oil windfall profits tax will give us a little breathing room
3236764 this provision gives us the capital to wildcat additional fields
3236765 the spot price of gasoline should be at 2 00 a gallon the idea that its a supply demand thing is a joke at this time
3236766 it would be a shame to see us forced out just to have big oil price gouging occur in a few years after they are sure we are all gone

3236800 all im saying is we have to be careful when we have something following an established process where we are working with people to try and get our point across
3236801 i wanted to state there is a flaw in the process to give us another avenue another vehicle besides reconsideration i thought this would be added ammunition to give to council by going public

3236803 i believe the city of charlottetown now should be very proactive and start to work to create an industrial park we should be working with industrial owners that are in the heart of the city and do not have to be there from a transportation and location perspective and a safety and security perspective
3236804 youre trying to create a quality of life that exists in the nice new subdivisions that are being built where the residents would never have to experience or have to live alongside industrial use
3236805 their safety record has been very good i think it depends on the situation but i dont foresee a problem at least i hope not

3237081 jikalau benar kita telah bersungguh sungguh dalam berserah diri pada allah sudah pasti kita akan berada pada sebuah keadaan yang diliputi kedamaian ketentraman kemaslahatan dan kemanfaatan yang telah dikodratkannya untuk kita
3237082 jika kita berada pada sebuah keadaan yang diwarnai perselisihan atau eyel eyelan perpecahan bahkan permusuhan maka sudah pasti itu terjadi karena kita sedang menuruti perasaan nafsu kita sendiri dimana sudah pasti pula akan membawa dampak resiko yang harus kita tanggung kelak di kemudian hari

3237084 after a thorough consultation process the ioc executive board has approved a final version of the competition schedule which sees a spread of events throughout the day with some finals in the morning and some in the evening there can never be a perfect one size fits all solution which suits each and every stakeholder equally but the ioc decision has endeavored to find the best balance for the olympic movement as a whole
3237085 this is a great opportunity for our sport to be showcased to the nearly one billion people in the potential television audience of the americas during the first nine days of the 2008 olympic games in beijing the live prime time exposure is something that can only benefit the sport of swimming and enhance the public profile of our sports top athletes the iocs decision to announce this nearly two years prior to the olympic games ensures a level playing field for all athletes no matter what the schedule our athletes will be ready to swim their best when their best is needed
3237086 my problem with the schedule change was that money bought tradition in the sport
3237087 whether the heats or the final are in the morning and the afternoon does not matter to us in terms of performance
3237088 i think in this day and age i think that loyalty is very lacking in sport and i think that often money talks too loudly
3237089 i just think when it comes to issues like that there is certain traditions that need to be followed
3237090 thats the first time that three of the five biggest sports in the summer olympics are essentially all happening simultaneously on american television
3237091 its almost like divine intervention that it worked out that way
3237092 and when you add to that our womens gymnastics team is the best weve ever sent to a games and they are rivaled by the chinese its going to be a fierce fight
3237093 a lot of it is going to be how well the athletes perform
3237094 michael phelps the gymnastics team basketball a lot of it is the live sports its really the worlds greatest reality show
3237095 it was certainly the greatest olympic relay race i have ever seen i have been trying to think about another race that i got more excited about and i cant think of one
3237096 that race is why we get into the business of sports broadcasting it was just absolute excitement shock and the utmost of wattage it was just so unexpected it was so clear that bernard was going to win this race and in those last meters it was like a switch was flipped and all of a sudden lezak pulled it out i think it has been clear throughout the games that we are certainly not rooting for the americans the excitement that we had was just simply about an unbelievable piece of drama in the pool
3237097 i dont want to jinx him i just dont see the challenge out there the 100m is such a tricky event because it is short
3237098 that is the one that going in six months ago everybody said was going to be the one that was really going to be the toughest one and i still think it is going to be very difficult by then that will be the seventh gold medal that he would be gunning for he might be on such a roll that he would be unstoppable but ian crocker and the rest of the world has gotten real fast in that event so its going to be a tough one
3237099 right after it is purposefully leaked to the journalist whos buttered us up
3237100 be one of the first 5 million people to learn of the choice
3237101 he said hes the main character in a treasured folk tale journey to the west that all chinese parents get for their children
3237102 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me
3237103 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on i knew taeshwan park was going to have a good last 50 meters so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3237104 the bottom line is that alcohol and minors dont mix this law protects minors from adults who are complicit in encouraging underage drinking
3237105 weve seen too many sad cases which could have been avoided if an adult had stepped in and done the right thing
3237106 the hudson river is one of the most picturesque waterways in the world and the hudson ferry go round is a perfect vehicle for reconnecting people of all ages to the river and the historic towns lining its shores
3237107 ferry go round shows what a tremendous resource we have at our doorsteps in the hudson river what better way to celebrate the upcoming quadricentennial than by riding on the river and enjoying a fun day in its riverfront communities
3237108 the conservatorys new mission and strategic direction reaffirms our commitment to skills based arts instruction and helps us better respond to students interests needs and abilities whether you are taking a performing arts class for the first time or have had years of experience the conservatory has a program thats right for you

3237112 even if drivers are taken away from the wheel can we ever take the mere fact of being human out of traffic
3237113 monderman was in essence thinking like an architect in a realm that had been handed over entirely to engineers
3237114 what is going on seems to have less to do with a change in personality than with a change in our entire being in traffic we struggle to stay human
3237115 driving with its exhilarating speed and the boundless personal mobility it grants us is strangely life affirming but also for most of us the most deadly presence in our lives
3237116 he sought the secrets of the pole but sees the secrets of god
3237117 a tree is male its buds are female its leaves are neuter
3237118 horses are sexless gods are male cats are female tomcats included
3237119 any language is a supreme achievement of a uniquely human collective genius as divine and endless a mystery as a living organism
3237120 id say im a linguist but id been struggling to get a handle on welsh until i started using a software package my husband is welsh and his parents speak it as their first language so i really wanted to be able to say at least a few words in their native tongue
3237121 id tried various books but was finding welsh a nightmare until a friend recommended rosetta stones software i was worried at first because im not very computer savvy but it uses pictures and sounds to guide you through various levels of the language without having to translate anything
3237122 its idiot proof when im in the study with the door shut the language just comes alive and i become totally immersed its totally different from teaching or learning a language in a classroom the programme also gives me the benefits of having a welsh speaker in the room without it being my husband who just takes the mickey
3237123 dyn dan awyren is the first welsh expression i used on my husband when he was standing outside looking at a low flying plane it means man under aeroplane perhaps you had to be there but it was so funny
3237124 before i met my partner isabelle two years ago my french was really very basic but since then its improved dramatically
3237125 my number one goal is being able to sit down with isabelles parents at christmas and have a proper conversation its nerve racking enough to meet your partners parents without having to worry about the language
3237126 svp parlez vous anglais which as everyone knows means please do you speak english i always find that it gets me out of trouble
3237127 i went to china in 2003 after id graduated to teach english at a university in ningbo a big city near shanghai
3237128 learning written mandarin the language spoken in most of china is as hard as it looks
3237129 speaking is a little bit easier and once you start to make an effort you pick up words quite quickly
3237130 i ended up staying for more than three years and marrying li li who is from ningbo we now live near manchester where i teach at a secondary school my year 8 class just won a british council prize for a mandarin play i taught them so i guess i ended up doing pretty well
3237131 ive been travelling to italy on holiday for five or six years but about a year ago i decided to make an effort to learn the language i found the best way for me was the michel thomas audio programme which ive now got on my ipod
3237132 ive always thought that evening classes were for people who cant decide if they want to learn pottery or basic weaving and by that i mean theyre for people who want a past time or social club classes just werent for me
3237133 id also tried lots of audio books but they can be so useless teaching pointless phases like oh look theres a donkey on the beach call me a taxi but this programme builds up structure in an unique way now my italian is pretty passable italian people gasp in surprise when i speak a little bit of italian simply because theyre so used to english people going there and just shouting loudly in english
3237134 i quite like lacqua fa ruggine which i think means water makes rust it refers to a preference for alcoholic drink rather than water
3237135 as my partner is from sweden i decided it would be a great opportunity to finally learn a second language id been learning the odd phrase here and there from my girlfriend until i heard about an evening class run by a swedish postgraduate student in the local bookshop
3237136 the classes were really relaxed with generally no more than two other students wed do exercises from textbooks and practise reading writing and speaking it was pretty much everything youd expect in a normal language course except in a more relaxed environment
3237137 the classes gave me enough basics to continue on my own and i can now hold a simple conversation in swedish later this month ill be moving there to study for a ma in politics although the course will be taught in english i hope that by the time i complete it i will have learnt a second language
3237138 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3237139 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3237140 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3237141 this isnt rejecting cookies outright you are just preferring not to see the ads
3237142 its going to have a huge impact on his brand because what theyve been trying to do with the businessweek com 5 1 08 is to make it seem more global you cant get a better stage than the opening ceremony of a global event like the olympics
3237143 we are quite happy with our business here in china
3237144 we also believe that this growth will continue for the next several years here in china first and foremost because our brand is extremely strong here
3237145 li ning was in a torchbearer uniform which is from adidas
3237146 if i had to guess i would say the uniform was from li nings company
3237147 youve got some people whove got money and theyre coming in and buying those premium brands
3237148 but with the financial markets down some thats off slightly and you have to expect that
3237149 it is wrong to say certain segments of the market are immune to economic downturns in the market as far as were concerned
3237150 nobody on the payroll today is willing to sell out their kids the next generation of workers
3237151 we cannot speculate on the consequences for prices obviously its a positive element for europe but other elements are also important especially the state of stocks around the world
3237152 the reason to go to india no longer is just about cost
3237153 the forecast for gdp will in all likelihood be revised lower perhaps even to show a recession in the second half of this year at the same time we expect an upward revision to the cpi inflation forecast for 2008 the peak will probably be in the region of 5 5 per cent the bank is unlikely to endorse market expectations of rate cuts over the next 12 months
3237154 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
3237155 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
3237156 most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
3237157 years of unsustainable increase in public spending have left the public finances in poor shape to cushion these adverse shocks
3237158 but there was no hesitation to go ahead because this building is an investment in our future
3237159 allow passengers to move at their own pace decompress and reduce stress
3237160 we went out to the major carriers and said can you give us a better price if we bring in our 58 000 students as opposed to a college of 2 500
3237161 everything we wanted was built into it for less cost
3237162 the bottom line is that for institutions to survive financially in the coming years they are going to have to adopt more business like operating practices
3237163 what we have done is concentrated every year on the more complex projects our members find it hard to do on their own because frankly thats where the bigger savings are
3237164 in five years we plan to hold about 1 million square metres of commercial space in central beijing which will represent 70 of our net asset value
3237165 but we are still very much focused on earnings growth and earnings growth still comes from selling properties the soho brand is about selling and we can sell at higher prices and faster than others it would be a shame if we dont capitalise on that so we will continue to sell
3237166 these are high net worth individuals who may have a coal mine or a factory in guangzhou and who want to buy downtown commercial property for leasing and for asset appreciation so we sell to them now we think we should move on to own a bit more ourselves
3237167 the summer is historically a dead time in recruiting so this has definitely changed the way were looking at how we fill our talent need
3237168 the smaller shops are realizing this is a great time to pick off talent
3237169 i think an average mba interested in investment banking is thinking he or she may need to look more broadly and i think the boutique firms will capitalize on that
3237170 theres a general anxiety among students now i dont think anyone trusts any of the companies whether its an investment bank corporation or a commercial bank anything could happen
3237171 we had a job offer rescinded from someone in the automotive industry so certainly there is risk across all the industries this year

3237188 to give him a better chance to work on all of his pitches
3237189 we put the pads on and it wouldve been really easy for them to come out and not be really too fired up about it
3237190 there are some sore guys on this team and it would be easy for guys to have that woe is me attitude there was none of that
3237191 it was one of our best practices thats a good sign
3237192 they dont feel good about the 34 13 loss to the titans and they know that weve got to do a lot better this week and improve a lot as a team
3237193 youre into it youre concentrating and youre working on your game its been fun
3237194 thats what real football players do they want to stay in the game he wanted to give us the best chance to win the game
3237195 but thats just todd those are the kind of guys that are going to get us over the hump
3237196 i was skeptical going into the game but everything worked out fine as long as its coming through clear it makes it easier i dont have to search for defensive coordinator jim haslett on the sideline
3237197 i just try and stay away especially from places that ive coached
3237198 i can put a chainsaw in my hand anytime i want ill find something to do
3237199 because you look at it its a great symbol of so many wonderful things that happen
3237200 i wanted the kids here to see that the rams theres people in this building that know how to do it theyve already done it
3237201 i told him id like him to come spend a couple days visit kind of pick his brain about 99 every years different but as coaches weve all got to kind of stick together because you have those up waves and those down waves
3237202 they didnt tell me he was coming to pick me up
3237203 i look out there and hes standing there hes such a special piece of work
3237204 i dont miss the days i got my butt beat i dont miss the days i worried about some guy holding out i dont miss the days walking off with some guy who had a serious knee injury but i miss all the other things i miss the coaches and i miss the players
3237205 he and i and jay sat and solved all the problems of the world till about 1 oclock this morning
3237206 i forgot how much fun it is to sit with football people and talk football
3237207 im honored that scott wants me to talk to the team for a while
3237208 im starting to mill some thoughts through my mind because they are right now where we were we had four wins in 98 they had three in 07
3237209 philadelphia we went 9 7 after two years here we won the world championship in my third in kansas city we went 13 3 and got beat in the playoffs the third year
3237210 everyones got to do it his own way with his own philosophy
3237211 im no expert but the only thing i talked about with linehan is what i believe in
3237212 im pulling for him last year was a tough year but sometimes you come out of a tough year better off for having the experience too hes a quality guy hes a good coach you want him to succeed
3237213 i coached against him when he was at minnesota and i practiced against him when i was with the chiefs
3237214 wed go spend two days working against minnesota during camp so i watched him coach and work with the offense and he did a marvelous job i like him a lot
3237215 they can get it going again here scott can get it going here
3237216 i just wanted to be out at the 50 metre point and thats where i was i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3237217 i knew park is strong in the last 50 metres
3237218 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3237219 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3237220 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3237221 union electric co employee thomas lee mango jr 37 was fatally shot in the 3900 block of natural bridge avenue while on his way to work
3237222 it was kind of like a tackle in football pretty much i was used to that
3237223 i just remember taking everybody down in my weight class the first day of practice i was like man this is so fun as soon as i started i knew that was what i wanted to do
3237224 i did not see him as hungry he just like switched
3237225 his results are talking a lot of what im saying
3237226 some athletes are behind one or two points you can tell they break he can switch the match at the last second
3237227 if im behind in the first period hes like do this do this
3237228 we felt given the history carpenter has had with george and whats at stake with him being just back from elbow surgery this just made the most sense
3237229 nobody knows carp better than carp but a close second would be dr paletta
3237230 we want to avoid this becoming a major setback in any way
3237231 i did a lot of exercises with weights stretching all the normal stuff for the rotator cuff and it felt fine
3237232 there are some spots they get me where i can still feel it its still a little sore
3237233 breaking ball got better like i was hoping and i could locate fastball i had more good pitches it was a step forward
3237234 we dont want to play a guessing game with what could be wrong
3237235 we just want to make sure were not going backward hes done so many positive things to get to this point to get himself back here that we dont want to risk that this is a cautionary thing
3237236 ziggy hood now a senior he came in as a true freshman and he was ready baston said monday
3237237 me i needed a couple of years to get my body right but mostly to get my mind right now im exactly where i want to be
3237238 i didnt take it as seriously as i should in the beginning he said
3237239 when i first got here i always had the ability but i took it as going to play football and left it at that now i study film and i go hard every rep i take things more serious
3237240 its nice to see him mature coach gary pinkel said
3237241 it happens to a lot of guys everybody wants to see a guy be spectacular right when he arrives a lot of kids have to mature and grow and if they have a great effort and a great attitude and are team players guess what it works im proud of him for how much hes improved
3237242 its hard to replace lorenzo williams but hes getting better day in and day out hes taking big strides hes gotten a whole lot better on the pass rush
3237243 its going to be a big day for everybody he said

3237254 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3237255 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organisation today and thats a shame
3237256 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3237257 the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years
3237258 punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday against chivas usa
3237259 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3237260 their pitching staff their bullpen is real good when you have a pitching staff like they have you always have a chance
3237261 pitching against baltimore last year it looked so easy now its not easy his stuff is real good at times his execution wasnt this kids trying not to mope around hes fighting his butt off
3237262 with all due respect to mr bay id rather pitch to mr bay than to manny ramirez i hope they keep manny in the national league treat him well keep him there please
3237263 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3237264 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3237265 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3237266 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3237267 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3237268 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3237269 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3237270 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3237271 clare decided to call it a day and certainly stated very publicly that i was the next leader of the party some couple months before that and certainly this election a third term for labor was always going to be hard to win
3237272 i certainly think our base was cranky at the government for a number of reasons
3237273 i certainly think that some people dont like going to the polls early and that could have played a part
3237274 i still believe that we are more likely to secure the inpex investment with a labor government but i do concede that some people did not think that was a good reason
3237275 we work with whichever party forms government and are more than happy to do so
3237276 the government is really lucky to be back in office
3237277 many aboriginal people voted labor in the federal election because of what john howard and mal brough did to us with the intervention
3237278 but in the last 12 months neither the new rudd government or nt labor have done anything to reverse these destructive policies
3237279 the first lesson in politics is work out who is on your side
3237280 this is a remarkable strategy being pursued by a couple of high powered spin doctors it is almost the red adair strategy deflect attention from the iemma governments incompetence by being even more hopeless than morris iemma and his team
3237281 what it is is this the iemma government was elected by the people to deliver better services jobs and investment and build better infrastructure and that is what the people care about
3237282 undisturbed earth below the frost line remains at a relatively constant temperature year round this temperature equates roughly to the average annual air temperature of the chosen location so is usually 7 21 degrees celsius 45 70 degrees fahrenheit depending on location
3237283 overall maternal mortality has significantly decreased 14 deaths less than in 2006 and that there has been a clear decline of mortality due to abortion only one death compared to an average between 8 and 10 per year in the last decade
3237284 this process has not been easy for doctors since the majority of them reject the procedure
3237285 the only person the medical team could find who knew sign language was my brother
3237286 i didnt want him to know i really didnt want anyone in my family to know i was physically hurt ashamed and embarrassed
3237287 its important that all people who are abused have someone to talk to someone impartial and knowledgeable who can offer advice without judgment
3237288 i would say that it is even more important for victims who have a disability to have that
3237289 i honestly didnt expect to see such a thing in my lifetime
3237290 one of the goals of the project will be to establish a national data collection process so we can get solid numbers to back up the need we know is there
3237291 what i can tell you is that statistically persons with disabilities are at least twice as likely to be victims of domestic or sexual assault when you consider that the statistics for the general population are already incredibly high one in three women is the accepted statistic although it varies this is a mind boggling problem
3237292 victim advocacy programs are not equipped to provide culturally appropriate and linguistically accessible services to deaf survivors
3237293 at best most programs will make a half hearted effort to find an interpreter for support groups or make sure their shelters are physically accessible this is not enough thus deaf victims and survivors rarely get the services they need to help them heal and move on with their lives
3237294 because my abuse was at the hands of a family member that had nearly constant access to me i moved into a facility for battered and abused women
3237295 it was nice enough rather like living in a dormitory but no one there spoke my language and i had a very limited ability at that time to read lips it was isolating although i logically understood that i was there to be helped and out of concern for my safety the day to day reality is that i felt as if i was being punished for what happened
3237296 the broad focus of this three year process will be building a strong foundation for jdvnc at the federal level focusing on sustainability
3237297 all of us involved in the project have a goal of making sure this organization is around for the long haul we have a lot of dreams to accomplish
3237298 the grant is for a continuation of the program that the iowa coalition has been doing since 2003
3237299 its a national technical assistance project that provides training support on site visits skill building conference calls and many other resources to the staff at all 54 state and territorial sexual assault coalitions which in turn hopefully means that there is a trickle down affect to the 1 350 rape crisis centers that are across the nation and serve all victims of sexual violence its a way for us to provide up to date information resource sharing and training to those coalition staff who then go back and share that information and those resources
3237300 there has been an understanding and a shift in the last few years that services from within culturally and linguistically specific communities are more effective than an outreach model of a mainstream rape crisis center providing services as an outreach effort to that community
3237301 services developed within that community are more apt to better meet the needs of survivors
3237302 pierre bourdieu key concepts an introduction to the writings of pierre bourdieu
3237303 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3237304 the reality is that gay activists arent seeking equal access to marriage they can already marry it just must be to a person of the opposite sex
3237305 today we are in a cultural war over two views of sexuality our judeo christian sexual ethic of monogamous heterosexual marriage and the gay ethic of sexual license the battleground is the classroom and it is the children who will be the greatest casualties if we do not respond
3237306 under the guise of safety and diversity these activists are introducing children as young as first grade to sexual lifestyles that are unhealthy and dangerous these kids are encouraged to accept and celebrate perversity even before they have an understanding of normal sexuality
3237307 all one has to do is look at the bill to see that it authorizes the establishment of businesses on main street to dispense marijuana in addition to allowing 18 year olds to grow upwards of 60 to 300 of pounds of marijuana it doesnt take a rocket scientist to realize what theyre up to
3237308 its disappointing it sends the wrong message to young girls shes in a position of influence being married to a public figure whether one likes it or not theres a degree of responsibility that goes with it
3237309 we need a flexible nursing workforce that matches skills to patient and client needs while ensuring tasmania keeps pace with contemporary developments in the health workforce across australia and overseas

3237314 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness

3237316 this kind of brutal attack has happened before against georgia and against other countries that the russians want to dominate
3237317 russia has the right to intervene anywhere in the former soviet union
3237318 probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time
3237319 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3237320 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3237321 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3237322 georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the combat zone

3237327 mayo has a chance to say to canberra we will not allow this river to die on our watch we will not be the electorate that had the chance to say something and wasnt heard

3237459 in the economic arena all of a sudden you are seeing private investment you see the electricity grid is literally all up for the first time in about three years and oild production is up by some 400 000 barrels i think in the last six months as well in part because of electricit which then means there is more fuel for the electricity

3237475 obama spends so much time courting the rich that im not surprised that james webb has removed himself from consideration for vice president webb is the most articulate senate critic of americas class divide the most important and unfortunately the least debated issue in politics today is our drift toward a class based system the likes of which we have not seen since the 19th century

3237505 we know that there remain some very important questions around the best way to use herceptin the question about whether herceptin should be given at the same time as other chemotherapy drugs or following other drug treatment is not expected to be more clearly answered for a number of years
3237506 i am personally involved with the treatment of women with breast cancer who are receiving herceptin along with other usual treatments and they are frequently accepting of the shorter course of treatment which on balance appears to offer similar benefits and with potentially fewer harms compared to the longer courses of herceptin treatment
3237507 many health professionals working with patients with cancer are incredibly passionate about doing the best for their patients that means at times there is very vigorous debate about difficult judgement calls on what constitutes optimal treatments this debate is healthy though at times to the general public it can seem complex and on occasion make patient treatment decisions even more difficult
3237508 there are many day to day pressures within cancer control treatment programmes and it is important that the changing mix of treatments work as well as possible within our overall framework
3237509 we dont want we will look at it we want firm commitments

3237551 if you look at the history of how cities are developed in canada neighbourhoods are situated right next to industries
3237552 that happens across toronto and in most cities in canada you will have that nearby arrangement which is why the community has a right to know what chemicals are being stored and used in those facilities
3237553 we know that propane facilities within 1 6 kilometres is the danger zone which is why people were asked to evacuate their houses within 1 6 km

3237561 the dense jewish population on the lower east side of manhattan shows in its appreciation of its own humble yiddish poetry and the drama much the same spirit that controlled the rough audiences of the elizabethan theater there as in the london of the sixteenth century is a veritable intellectual renascence

3237577 my main goal is to get us into the eighth inning with the lead and unfortunately i wasnt able to do it it was tough knowing we had a one run lead against a team like this that any one of them can hit a homer at any time i knew there wasnt much room for error with beckett hes a great proven pitcher and he had his a stuff today
3237578 its just frustrating for us to have danks pitch as well as he did and not come out of there with the win

3237589 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3237590 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3237591 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to

3237610 don nacho trelles hablaba de que el futbol no tiene fronteras y desde luego hay un reglamento y creo que aqu adem s de hablar de n mero hay que decir de qu posiciones porque si hablamos de tres o cuatro todos se van a apuntar como medio volante o delantero pienso que si re nen el perfil que se juegue con tres
3237611 yo s creo que en la federaci n mexicana de futbol como pol tica de registro de jugadores debe haber un l mite y en el llamado a la selecci n nacional tambi n debe darse

3237615 en cuanto a la primera convocatoria que hizo el se or eriksson a leandro augusto y mat as vuoso ha desatado mucha pol mica y l va a estar midiendo todos estos aspectos del entorno y creo que debe haber un l mite
3237616 hay algunos casos como el de gabriel caballero o antonio naelson el de sinha s que sinha se nacionaliz desde que estaba enla primera a y creo que lo hizo no pensando en la selecci n mexicana as que habr a que reconocer todas estas aspiraciones leg timas de los jugadores que pueden nacionalizarse

3237689 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3237690 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3237691 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3237692 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3237693 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3237694 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3237695 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3237696 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

3237698 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3237699 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3237700 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3237701 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3237702 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3237703 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3237704 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3237705 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3237706 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3237707 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3237708 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3237709 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3237710 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3237711 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3237712 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

3237716 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3237717 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3237718 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3237719 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3237720 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3237721 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3237722 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3237723 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3237724 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3237727 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3237728 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3237729 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3237730 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3237731 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3237732 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3237733 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3237743 fearing damage done to her reputation by the relationship studio bosses at universal have decided to delay the release of her latest film hippie hippie shake until next spring a hollywood insider revealed hippie hippie shake has been delayed until next spring at the earliest the original plan was definitely to release it this year the date was in all the trade magazines one of the main reasons for the delay is siennas love life the studios hope the coverage will have died down by the spring last month it was revealed that she had split from welsh actor rhys ifans after pictures emerged of her kissing mr getty in prague in june she initially fled to new york when news of their affair broke last month but the relationship now appears to be very much back on track

3237747 if we can demonstrate that the ridge is part of the north american continent the danes can use that information to show it is also part of greenland
3237748 they can use it to define their outer limits to the east and we can use it define outer limits to the west and we both benefit
3237749 this allows canada to establish its outer limits once and for all
3237750 that gives canada the exclusive rights to develop the natural resources on and below the seabed in that area
3237751 believes the debates will be an excellent opportunity for him to discuss with hoosiers the great progress indiana has experienced in the last four years and further share his positive vision for the future
3237752 while we had hoped for five to seven debates in communities around the state we are pleased that mitch daniels has agreed to these three venues
3237753 it will give hoosiers a real opportunity to compare the candidates their views and their long terms plans to rebuild this economy
3237754 y es que en otras palabras me aburro f cil
3237755 this has been an incredible tournament for me and today was bittersweet
3237756 losing was pretty disappointing but to walk in that stadium and hear the roar of the crowd even if it was against me it was really incredible
3237757 they can really appreciate what youre doing technically or physically and thats really cool
3237758 in canada thats not always the case and in athens even sometimes people had to look at the scoreboard to know who was winning or losing so definitely theres an appreciation here that makes the ambience really special
3237759 within 10 minutes of arriving at the olympic village i found out she passed away so that was very emotional
3237760 in my first round win i narrowly escaped defeat so i pointed up to her and she helped me out there
3237761 somebody asked me after the match why is china so good at badminton and why isnt canada so good and i said they believe they can be the best in the world while we grow up and believe we can be top hockey players but we dont grow up thinking we can be no 1 in the world of badminton
3237762 i believe it will be a very tough competition we re up for it
3237763 if you see something you love just clap for it
3237764 to be honest when i did see my score come up on floor i was a little bit shocked
3237765 i thought that i would score higher based on what we have done in our model training and the scores ive been getting from the judges there
3237766 my b score was a 9 0 and i think that was just a little bit harsh
3237767 i try my best to pay attention to the small details
3237768 in the interest of honesty and correctness the judging had to become more fair and transparent

3237772 its clear that several states are leading the way with healthier school policies
3237773 by advocating for more school nurses banning tobacco preparing for asthma and allergy emergencies and other measures some states are excellent role models
3237774 asthma and allergies have a major effect on schools and student performance
3237775 so its important to see which states are making strides to address these issues
3237776 when we recognize high performing states it shows everyone in the asthma and allergy community that progress can be made it also gives people in other states the confidence to push for similar progress in their schools
3237777 in addition to the strength of our scientific validation cogstate was selected from among its competitors because of the ability to successfully apply the cogstate systems across different cultures and different languages
3237778 the value of contracts in place at this early stage of the financial year puts cogstate in a tremendous position to continue our revenue growth in the 2009 financial year this time last year we had contracts in place that would generate 1 4 million of revenue over their life 1 1 million of that in the 2008 financial year so our position is significantly stronger than it was only 12 months ago

3237787 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3237788 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3237789 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3237790 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3237791 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3237792 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3237793 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3237794 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3237795 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3237796 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3237797 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3237798 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3237799 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3237800 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3237801 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3237802 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3237803 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3237804 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3237805 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3237806 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3237807 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3237808 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3237809 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3237811 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3237812 this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive
3237813 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3237814 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few

3237817 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3237818 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3237819 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3237820 in a future world grappling with environmental and technological issues the story focuses on 5 reluctant heroes whose remarkable genetic code makes them earths only hope of defeating extra terrestrial invaders gatchaman will be a big effects rich movie with some of the most ambitious action sequences ever seen in animation
3237821 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3237822 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3237823 incentive fees are only applicable to mortgage loans serviced under the special servicing option in which fannie mae assumes the risk of loss from borrower default
3237824 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3237825 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3237826 i just you know i really i just wanted that medal so badly
3237827 i feel even though my brother says i havent i feel like ive let people down
3237828 but he said yesterday that he can see why ive stayed in it so long the camaraderie we make friends with these people i see them so much two of the people i competed with i got to meet their kids and theyre now 19 and 22 and they got to meet my niece sarah now 19 theres a lot of caring that goes on amongst us
3237829 i love the challenge of it i love the feeling when everything goes well and absolutely the worst feeling in the world is when it all falls apart like my last round
3237830 i think i hit the first bird clay pigeon missed the second one
3237831 i thought fine i did that before i did this calming technique i use and all that and you know what it just didnt work i sort of never really got into a good rhythm
3237832 you know when you miss a few and the thing is ive been in this sport so long i knew you miss two and youll probably still be in the final
3237833 its a sort of panic and you think oh shit am i ever going to hit another bird
3237834 now that its been how long after ive done it i think thats what happened i keep forgetting to keep my eyes calm and then my body tries to catch up
3237835 but i take it year by year and i want to shoot 2009 because then i will have competed for canada at the world level for 40 years its pretty cool
3237836 i didnt think id be at this olympics now my teammates and my brother sort of think i might be around but who knows its hard because unlike the young pups i have a job and have to work for a time
3237837 i always joke that im always glad ian millar the equestrian is on the team because hes four years older
3237838 and ian was 57 when he decided to come to these games so who knows
3237839 i guess ill be like former skater kurt browning and win all these world championships and never win an olympic medal
3237840 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3237841 summits shouldnt be seen quantitatively if earlier gujarat wasnt on the map of investment destinations things have changed people know it is a destination with good infrastructure and a receptive atmosphere
3237842 instead of holding big summits effort should be made to organize smaller meetings with the developers of different sectors who have proposed to invest but havent yet revealed their plans to invest
3237843 the war in iraq is even less popular in oregon than it is nationally
3237844 there is less resource extraction fewer farms and tree fellers and more high tech workers
3237845 it will be a little bit more difficult for mccain to consolidate the republican base here in washington state then it will be for obama to consolidate those clinton supporters
3237846 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
3237847 most of lamborns support is from social conservatives not economic conservatives whereas jeff crank i would characterize as more of an economic conservative much of his support comes from the business community in colorado springs
3237848 sub rosa you have this philosophical split going on which in many ways characterizes the republican party nationwide
3237849 my voting record will be conservative as well plus i want to be a leader on these things and push our party to really cut spending
3237850 we didnt do it when we had control of congress and thats why in my view we lost control of congress
3237851 die mehrheit und damit die kontrolle wird in italienischer hand bleiben aber nat rlich wollen wir internationale allianzen schmieden

3237857 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign

3237860 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
3237861 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
3237862 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
3237863 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3237864 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3237865 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
3237866 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them

3237871 weve kind of been this rogue team for a long time that has been like were making a good game over here
3237872 its been somewhat recently that people go wow this looks like a pretty good game
3237873 we let creative people be creative i looked at the artists and designers and said youre not an artist and youre not a designer youre a game maker i dont care where the best idea comes from as long as it gets in this game
3237874 wed like to stress this isnt something ea spent a lot of money on
3237875 i felt shocked but more relief it has been a long journey a long eight years
3237876 i gave it everything i could i couldnt care less about the time olympic gold is an olympic gold it doesnt matter how it went or how i raced
3237877 in athens i got criticism i was still in my hole still learning about myself
3237878 ive enjoyed it so much id hate to finish knowing theres still a flame burning inside theres so much more left in me so much i can do
3237879 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3237880 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3237881 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3237882 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
3237883 the blood pressure reduction was unexpected as this was not a trial to determine whether exercise would reduce blood pressure
3237884 clinicians will always decry not having enough time to counsel but a method of using a prescription pad with exercise recommendations as suggested in the study will help solve this quandary
3237885 to the fact that preventive health services do not practically reach a very high priority in our medical system
3237886 if someone becomes ill with a heart attack many thousands of dollars are spent without question but if a physician needs to spend time counseling patients insurers typically do not reimburse well for these vital services
3237887 it sets the benchmark for comparison with current studies and future studies
3237888 is very unfortunate as such counseling is inexpensive and recommended by the u s preventive services task force a very well respected organization of health prevention experts
3237889 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3237890 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3237891 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3237892 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3237893 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3237894 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3237895 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3237896 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment

3237904 i was flat out told that this is how the iphone behaves and nothing is wrong every time it changes wifi networks it has to establish its email port 25 over and over again and so it will not connect to the next network it finds until you restart your iphone
3237905 where were you sent you an email you missed the meeting
3237906 in the 14 days since we launched its been a rocky road and we know the pain some people have been suffering
3237907 be assured people here are working 24 7 to improve matters and were going to favor getting you new info hot off the presses even if we have to post corrections or further updates later
3237908 the team has also fixed over 70 bugs including one that was preventing mobileme imap mail folders from syncing correctly between the web app and mac os x mail or outlook
3237909 plus others correcting display issues in calendar and in general enhancing the performance of our web apps

3237911 team the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour there are several things we could have done better mobileme was simply not up to apples standards it clearly needed more time and testing rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme eddys new title will be vice president internet services and he will now report directly to me yes i have had many many issues since upgrading my gen1 4gb phone to 2 0 email does not download properly from my pop3 server several accounts message previews dont show up consistently selecting a message from inbox results in endless spinning status indicator s very often and no message body showing up even after several minutes of spinning status indicator and no errors indicated either the emails have no attachments in most cases and are 1 2 pages so maybe 4 8k max in size networking in general seems to have been tanked by 2 0 the range of the wi fi seems less and the cellphone signal seems weaker than it was in the past fewer bars in general the edge egprs network access seems much slower too which is hard to do this release really seems to be a huge pos thats been my experience apple over i am so upset since i expected the normal apple quality and got ms quality instead oh to the apple zealots i dont want to see a single reply to this about how your phone was upgraded offline and works great or any of that crap i upgraded the phone with itunes online just like all the other updates if there was a better undocumented preference for upgrading the phone offline and this obscure method was the result of some de developing the upgrade process by doing offline upgrades during regression testing that from a software consistency qa and ease of use standpoint is incredibly lame and nothing but shear incompetence they should go work for ms to think someone will second guess the online update vs offline method is ludicrous and extremely bone headed the upgrade should work identically regardless of method used clear on that one zealots i do know what software development is difficult particularly when looking for bugs and trying to fix things but i agree that apple definitely dropped the ball on this one just like how steve jobs sent an email out to his employees about waiting for the introduction of mobileme well they should had made absolutely sure and positive that the 2 0 update was working stable none of that clunky lagging scrolling text messaging contact scrolling broken email lost weak signal etc etc crap oh well i too know how difficult design engineering can be since i worked at another unix platform company for 8 years doing design engineering and program management a really bright company i know how the process works and i know how the marketing pucks will push p1s1s out the door despite being out voted in the pm release meetings i hate to see apple do it to themselves again they changed the industry with the iphone just look at all the korean amp japanese knock offs coming out almost every month since july 2007 i would hate to see a replay of the 80s when arrogance in marketing resulted in a lost opportunity and 150b in billy gs pockets i spent 15 years in the valley from 1985 to 2000 i used to see wozniak at the original pancake house in saratoga nearly every saturday or sunday in the late 80s early 90s they apple have had mobile phones on their minds for quite sometime because back in 1990 wozniak had a home made wrist watch based cellphone he used a timex calculator watch or similar for the keypad and display had an earpiece and the guts of the phone on his belt in a 4x4x2

3237914 dr e paul zehr a professor of kinesiology and neuroscience who is also a martial arts expert has dissected the dark knight in a book to be published later this year in becoming batman the possibility of a superhero zehr who works at the university of victoria in canada shows the kind of training bruce wayne or any other mortal would have to put themselves through to become the caped crusader zehrs feasibility study involved trawling his collection of comics he is a life long batman fan who used to dress up as the superhero when he was a child and applying his knowledge of the brain the body and his own fighting skills he reckons it would take 15 to 20 years to fit in all the training required ideally starting in childhood
3237915 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3237916 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3237917 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3237918 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3237919 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3237920 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3237921 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3237922 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3237923 it is hoped that the businessmen would take the lead in reviving the economy by creating jobs through active investment and exploring markets abroad
3237924 i am well aware of the criticism among some people and so it was a difficult decision
3237925 but i made the decision because of the fact that the executives are having problems doing business overseas and that investor sentiment is hardly robust
3237926 i am very pleased with our overall results during the first half of 2008 after two years of a very hard work the company is finally getting back to the performance track the main drivers for the growth were continuing and solid demand for high definition tv products combined with successful customer base expansion helped by the european football championship and the beijing olympic games increased profitability was largely a result of improved efficiencies favorable product mix and streamlined supply chain operations it is also an impressive achievement from our staff whom i wholeheartedly congratulate for this we are now set for the second half of 2008
3237927 look at the flowers loyal to the earth we lend them fate from fates border but who knows if they regret the way they wither maybe its we who are their real regret all things want to float and we go around like burdens settling ourselves on everything ravished by weight what deadly teachers we are when things in fact have the gift of forever being children if someone took them into inmost sleep and slept soundly with things how lightly he might rise changed to changed days from that communal depth or maybe hed stay and theyd blossom and praise him the convert now with these brothers and sisters all still in the midst of the winds and the meadows

3237957 as about 8 months have passed since the first application hsbc has submitted an updated document that includes financialdata
3237958 there has been a significant change in the market as the world is revaluing assets based upon the perceived health of their own economies as it relates to the suddenly stronger us economy

3237960 a fall in oil prices is perceived in the market as somethingto encourage optimism about the u s economy and that would putupward pressure on treasury yields in the short term

3238001 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3238002 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3238003 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microphone is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3238004 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on

3238018 with india we will build on the close partnership developed over the past decade as two of the worlds great multi ethnic democracies the us and india are natural strategic allies and we must work together to advance our common interests and to combat the common threats
3238019 we believe it is in the united states interest that all of these emerging powers and others assume a greater stake in promoting international peace and respect for human rights including through their more constructive participation in key global institutions
3238020 we are committed to us engagement in asia this begins with maintaining strong relationships with allies like japan australia south korea thailand and the philippines and deepening our ties to vital democratic partners like india in order to create a stable and prosperous asia
3238021 we must also forge a more effective framework in asia that goes beyond bilateral agreements occasional summits and ad hoc diplomatic arrangements we need an open and inclusive infrastructure with the countries in asia that can promote stability prosperity and human rights and help confront transnational threats
3238022 it is a strategy that recognises that we have interests not just in baghdad but in kandahar and karachi in beijing berlin brasilia and bamako it is a strategy that contends with the many disparate forces shaping this century including the fundamentalist challenge to freedom the emergence of new powers like china india russia and a united europe
3238023 we need a global response to climate change that includes binding and enforceable commitments to reducing emissions especially for those that pollute the most the us china india the european union and russia

3238043 everyone lives in a watershed and we all live downstream from someone else we need to take care of the water in the watershed not just for us but for everyone water is a valuable commodity and we need to take care of it so we dont have dirty water to drink a few years down the road
3238044 commonsense morality is very demanding on a poor man in virtue of the fact that he would do so much better under utilitarianism
3238045 we expect this new calendar to highlight dukes rich cultural and arts scene promote collaboration across academic disciplines help our students get involved in activities and strengthen ties between the university and its neighbors
3238046 it should become a popular resource both on campus and with the many people who visit duke
3238047 this tool grew out of the collaborative efforts of faculty students and staff
3238048 after listening closely to what users want in a calendar we developed a system that enables departments to retain editorial oversight and publish to multiple calendar sites simultaneously it also gives users a better experience
3238049 we were guided by what students faculty and others at duke told us they needed
3238050 people search for information in different ways so we tried to provide a solution that will serve a technically savvy user who is comfortable with rss feeds as well as a local resident who just wants to skim through dukes website to find something fun to do this weekend
3238051 the main concern is the economy and the steep fall in demand
3238052 it seems that the weakness in the us economy has now spread to europe and asia and i think thats what the main concern is
3238053 one wonders whether former vice president of the united states al gores unfounded allegations and reprehensible statements against malaysia in support of anwar ibrahim is proof of the pudding that anwar ibrahim is a political puppet of the united states government isnt this proof that there has been and is in vigorous motion a concerted conspiracy to install their lackey in malaysia as further evidenced by the summoning of the malaysian envoy by the us state department the united states lost all moral authority when it lied to the world in order to invade iraq for its oil for starters democracy human rights and justice are merely slogans used by the united states administration when it is convenient this is a government that sanctioned the extraordinary rendition or kidnapping of suspected terrorist around the world to be transferred to secret torture camps in parts of europe and in third world countries perhaps al gore needs to be updated that true democracy is alive and well in malaysia we have had 12 general elections with the ruling coalition losing five states the federal territory as well as its two thirds majority in parliament in the most recently concluded general elections this couldnt have been possible if elections in malaysia werent free and fair al gore of all people should know this difference after failing in his popular bid for president in 2000 against a well connected george w bush how does one determine if a case is politically motivated if the due process of law isnt allowed to take place its a double insult that al gore had first supported the reformasi riots in 1998 and now chooses to support anwar ibrahim whom faces the very same charges of sodomy perhaps al gore doesnt understand the gravity of the charges of sodomy as it may not be a crime in the west but in malaysia its a serious unlawful act also the present political situation is getting even more severe as anwar ibrahim is like a chameleon changing colours whenever it suits him the world as well as malaysia lauds al gores efforts to combat global warming but playing the worn geo political game of propping up stooges in foreign countries will just serve to damage his credibility if anwar ibrahim has nothing to hide and hasnt committed any offence against the laws of malaysia then he has nothing to worry about although it is known that he has made public certain allegations against the impartiality of the judiciary it is the same judiciary that acquitted him of sodomy on a technicality therefore one wonders whether the recent disparaging comments made by foreign individuals about malaysia is the direct result of anwar ibrahim complaining to them and inviting them to exert pressure on the malaysian government to subvert the process and rule of law in order to allow him to continue with his ambitions to become the next prime minister however surreal that may be this then begs the question whether anwar ibrahim will surrender our sovereignty as a nation and sell out the rakyats interest if however unlikely it may be he were to become prime minister
3238054 we didnt lose because of him but it was right there
3238055 i saw them a bit flat and i also saw that they didnt take this massachusetts team as a tough team
3238056 they took it for granted but that is the only way these boys have lost a game when they take a team for granted hopefully it was a good experience for them
3238057 i know that this central team they are contenders so i hope we come out swinging
3238058 the biggest adjustment right now is for the linemen to understand the five different blocking schemes
3238059 last year it was easy because they just took the guy in front of them in 11 man weve realized how little time you have to make a play happen in six man a runner could cut back but now there are 11 guys there to get you
3238060 the system he is learning is five times more complicated and wont have as much time to create
3238061 whereas before he was able to create and make things happen now we will run a lot of quick routes with about two seconds to make the pass
3238062 we are running a spread offense and chose this system based on his talents
3238063 he only threw two interceptions last year so we are pretty confident with him right now
3238064 stanley hardly ever had a bad snap last year and was about 90 percent on target
3238065 drew has improved a whole lot because his commitment level has picked up both he and ryan are stocky kids who can use their strength well
3238066 all of these kids have good hands and are pretty smart
3238067 they dont have outstanding speed and danny will be mostly an h back for us
3238068 miles is new to the school but he has a lot of aggressiveness
3238069 aaron was one of our better tacklers last year and he is back defense will probably pick up their assignments a lot easier than the offense and it has looked that way so far
3238070 this is a position that is wide open and with the recent hurricane scare it cost us three practices
3238071 right now we are looking at punters and not even ready to look at kickers
3238072 one team that we do know is the woodlands theyve made the same transition we are making
3238073 oconnell is an established program and we are going to have our hands full with faith west and beaumont legacy
3238074 we need to do what we did in practice and not let our mistakes determine our game plan
3238075 so far our team chemistry and commitment is real strong in two a days but our numbers might pick up because we just got three transfers one from angleton west columbia and brazoswood
3238076 most clinical trials for new diabetes drugs do not consider the impact medication will have on a patients quality of life or other outcomes that are important to patients such as the risk of developing complications associated with diabetes according to a mayo clinic commentary in the lancet
3238077 the 1997 constitution does not prohibit the convening of a forum such as the charter process therefore the charter process does not violate the 1997 constitution
3238078 the draft charter also has not made any recommendations for reforms to be implemented outside the constitution therefore it is wrong and misleading to say that the charter is violating the 1997 constitution
3238079 the ccf believes that the political forum due to be held soon will provide continuation of the discussions on the recommendations of the charter the political forum also holds the key to resolving the current political crisis in a constitutional way
3238080 we are encouraged by the fact that all key political parties in fiji have agreed to be part of the forum
3238081 if you like you can eat alone in your room
3238082 the staff wants you to eat and drink on your own but if you wont well have to tube feed you

3238085 we are free only when we act according to goals and principles that we have given ourselves
3238086 his attack upon the bedrock assumptions behind liberal philosophy is even more pointed the coolly rational preference calculator that is the foundation unit of liberal economic political and social activity is dismissed as a chimera on the basis of evidence from a most unexpected quarter
3238087 part of a wider concern on the authors part to put reason back in its box to establish a legitimate ground for emotion and intuition as components within an authentic moral self
3238088 what flourished was the political power of capital and the culture of consumption forces that have turned it into a sort of market totalitarianism
3238089 act according to goals and principles that we have given ourselves
3238090 an enemy of reason by those seeking evidence of his iniquity
3238091 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3238092 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need

3238104 where are they now 2008 of course i clicked on it someone calculated how old they would actually be around and made indepth stories about their lives in current time i thought it was really interesting and creative of them to write something like that so i decided to post it on here
3238105 malaysian shooters featured in previous games as wildcard entries and i am the first to make the grade on merit but this is not the end of my battle i will be competing against the best and i will aim to come back with a personal best score
3238106 i have been training very hard and my target is to get among the top 10 it will be tough and i have to put aside the pressure and try to stay focussed on the task
3238107 there is no point coming all the way to beijing and let nervousness get the better of you i have to do well and let my result serve as an encouragement for our future shooters
3238108 i took up the job two months ago and this offers me a secure future previously i was jobless but trained full time

3238111 its a pity that i will not be around to celebrate his birthday but he will certainly be my inspiration and it will be a good gift for him if i meet my personal target
3238112 we like to make sure we use bandaids that are completely unable to be contaminated
3238113 i tried to go to your doctor appointments with you
3238114 how dare you rhyme in the presence of chuck norris
3238115 bobs ideology with the exception that hes pro life doesnt even remotely resemble the platform of the montana republican party
3238116 i dont think anyone knows but he did and he is our opponent
3238117 his motto in life is that you take nothing for granted
3238118 montana is a big high school theres a real sense of fair play
3238119 theres a good story here with bob so i decided to follow it along
3238120 i can have sympathy for iverson that hes working hard to put his party together
3238121 but his vision of his party is way way over here to the right and then some thief in the middle of the night comes along and steals his prize rose bush
3238122 we call him blessed bob around here hes really got a good heart and has had one for a long long time
3238123 one thing bob has taught me is his passion for politics and his passion for life
3238124 the service is really important and i think the danes are the masters when it comes to this skill they have variety in their serves and often they trap their opponents to make the mistakes
3238125 kien keat and i want to have fun in our first games we are not going to put any undue pressure on ourselves it will be all about bringing out our best and enjoying each match as it comes nowadays i do not get too worked up over simple mistakes even though i strive to make perfect shots
3238126 i have given my best in training i feel calm with myself and i hope to maintain this good feeling when i land in beijing
3238127 the first round will make all the difference for us we can go far if we clear this hurdle
3238128 i was a national junior player when i watched our shuttlers in action during the 2004 athens olympics malaysia did not win a medal but it led me to think that one day i could be playing for the country in the games
3238129 everything has happened sooner than i imagined hopefully we will be able to bring back home a medal
3238130 he is more relaxed he has been enjoying the training sessions he has taken great effort to polish up his smashing skills lets hope he will show what he has gained in training in beijing
3238131 labor ruling party rejects the notion that dehumanising and punishing unauthorised arrivals with long term detention is an effective or civilised response
3238132 a person who poses no danger to the community will be able to remain in the community while visa status is resolved
3238133 every three months to ensure that the further detention of the individual is justified
3238134 management of health identity and security risks to the community
3238135 who have repeatedly refused to comply with their visa conditions
3238136 will help in the restoration of australias reputation as a nation which respects human rights
3238137 a big step forward but we dont feel that the administrative changes go anywhere near far enough
3238138 unauthorised boat arrivals at excised places will continue to be processed on christmas island but will now have access to legal assistance and an independent review of unfavourable decisions
3238139 none of the changes that chris evans has talked about is actually enshrined in law its very unclear what will be or if any of it will be enshrined in law
3238140 i think if chris evans was seriously committed to the humanitarian reform that he says he is he would sit down with the people who have had to deal with the issues over the last ten or twelve years
3238141 have had to pick up the pieces both in terms of support and in terms of the damage thats been done to the refugees individually
3238142 the changes that were announced do very little for the people who have been affected by the policy so far
3238143 listen up thanks to creative controls stupidity i was able to get them to pay for our new form of transportation
3238144 this is an official vehicle of tow security and not a toy so no fucking around second because were so under funded as it is if someone tries to steal the quad you should prevent them from doing so as if your life depended on it
3238145 your complete idiots why do i even try and trust you with something this valuable
3238146 its says were only in charge because mel couldnt trust anyone else when hes gone and that were almost as bad as vince russo
3238147 well some of thats true and as long as russo is still a step below us im alright with that

3238165 ive lived longer then i should of any way so you do what you have too
3238166 you have to show them your tits or pull out your beaver
3238167 i didnt ask motherfucker i told you to drink the fucking beer
3238168 you shut the fuck up or ill kill all your parents
3238169 theres a basic principle we have here that you always support your
3238170 theyre literally fighting for our freedom and many lose their lives so its the least we can do
3238171 chief pyle and the people of the choctaw nation are amazing patriots
3238172 they have done so much throughout the course of this conflict
3238173 he truly is a person who wakes up in the morning and goes to bed at night thinking about the soldiers serving our country
3238174 its a huge honor it was overwhelming for many of our tribal members
3238175 its nice for the indian people that have fought for so many years to be recognized
3238176 the city librarian heard about the accident recognized the suspect and car description and called police
3238177 very quiet police basically approached the suspect escorted him from the library building and took him away in a police car
3238178 moving tanks and troops through the separatist enclave of south ossetia and advancing toward the city of gori in central georgia
3238179 could everyone in the house please shut their fucking yappers so i could get my motherfucking shots please
3238180 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3238181 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3238182 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3238183 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3238184 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3238185 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3238186 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3238187 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3238188 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3238189 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3238190 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3238191 the traditional version is made of natural colored wood that looks great in any home the platform is about 18
3238192 theres anything thats happened in the past 7 1 2 years that the u s needs to apologize for in terms of foreign policy
3238193 no i dont believe in the u s apologizing as i said i think the war in iraq was a mistake we didnt keep our eye on the ball in afghanistan but you know hindsight is 20 20 and im much more interested in looking forward rather than looking backwards
3238194 the invasion of afghanistan was as illegal as the invasion of iraq
3238195 the u n charter provides that all member states must settle their international disputes by peaceful means and no nation can use military force except in self defense or when authorized by the security council after the 9 11 attacks the council passed two resolutions neither of which authorized the use of military force in afghanistan
3238196 the invasion of afghanistan was not legitimate self defense under article 51 of the charter because the attacks on september 11 were criminal attacks not armed attacks by another country afghanistan did not attack the united states in fact 15 of the 19 hijackers came from saudi arabia furthermore there was not an imminent threat of an armed attack on the united states after september 11 or bush would not have waited three weeks before initiating his october 2001 bombing campaign the necessity for self defense must be instant overwhelming leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation this classic principle of self defense in international law has been affirmed by the nuremberg tribunal and the u n general assembly
3238197 iraq has been killed never to rise again the american occupation has been more disastrous than that of the mongols who sacked baghdad in the thirteenth century only fools talk of solutions now there is no solution the only hope is that perhaps the damage can be contained
3238198 its time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put iraq back together and start spending the money putting america back together
3238199 who seek to rebuild their lives even as we pass on responsibility to the iraqi government
3238200 the american people have been extraordinarily resolved in alleged support of the iraq
3238201 america is part of what has gone wrong in the world
3238202 largely about oil reflections on empire petroleum democracy and the occupation of iraq
3238203 the roland mks 80 super jupiter has become infamous as the roland synth to own
3238204 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
3238205 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3238206 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3238207 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3238208 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3238209 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3238210 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3238211 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3238212 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3238213 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3238214 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3238215 weve sentenced people to having those overcrowded buses passing them up
3238216 the answer for more money for transit is not to not vote for transit for two more years
3238217 are expansions of service frequency on our 24 existing bus routes
3238218 is a problem today but our economy will recover it always does and will come roaring back and that will help metro bus service
3238219 unless you build additional highway lanes with buses youve got a more expensive system sitting in congested traffic so its really not a better buy comparatively
3238220 you need a rail system to provide another way for people to get around especially in urban centers
3238221 im living a normal life even though i have what i got
3238222 a lot of things in my life are better now
3238223 we dont know to what extent ongoing drug use interferes or affects the medication they take but crack or heroin interferes with adherence
3238224 theyre more than just an hiv infected person or a person using crack every day or a homeless person these are problems no one can manage by themselves these folks have struggled their whole lives
3238225 on paper they look good but hiv dementia and other problems have set in and even though newer medication has people living longer lives most of our residents probably wont ever go and live on their own
3238226 i probably would have gotten worse had i not come here and gotten help
3238227 ill always love you my first love my first everything
3238228 cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces
3238229 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3238230 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3238231 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3238232 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3238233 to put the world in order we must first put the nation in order to put the nation in order we must put the family in order to put the family in order we must cultivate our personal life and to cultivate our personal life we must first set our hearts right
3238234 punched herself in the face hard enough to blacken her eyes break her nose and knock her front teeth loose douched with an acid solution after mutilating her genital area poured a combustible liquid on herself and set it afire
3238235 konsekvensen er at nogle patienter vil komme til at vente l ngere end lovet
3238236 some of these clergy buried our loved ones we cant believe they arent coming
3238237 the ira have clearly gone off the stage since 2005 but attempts are still made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
3238238 the public stance was that in charlie haugheys phrase northern ireland was a failed political entity but the provos proved the northern ireland state was in fact a viable entity it was the provisional project that wasnt viable
3238239 republicanism is effectively dead it is dead as a strategy that can deliver anything it cant cope with the principle of consent it cant out manoeuvre it and it cant overcome it so it has had to reconcile itself with the british ground rules
3238240 republicanism is just an aspiration thats what it has been reduced to although there are still republicans we are just the survivors of the wreck
3238241 a completely different phenomenon from anything that was continued from 1916
3238242 we dont have an ira battalion in belfast we have a battalion of armed catholics
3238243 they werent a response to the british being in ireland but a response to how the british behaved there all the british needed to do to end the campaign was to change their behaviour but they didnt have to leave to get a deal
3238244 the struggle from the days of the civil rights movement to the present
3238245 did he not hanker after the very things the leadership sought affluence a house in another jurisdiction divesting the ira of its guns and its ultimate dissolution
3238246 freddie scappaticci should not be killed he should be on the sinn fein negotiating team
3238247 the biggest risk factor for the organisation was ex prisoners not prepared to return to prison for others such as sinn fein activists with a public profile the threat of assassination by loyalists was a constant on their minds one sure way to retain their profile minus the risk was to work for the british
3238248 it was a bit like watching your children graduate from college you thought fantastic now theyre free now theyve done it and theyre on their own
3238249 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3238250 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3238251 i have every sympathy for the families of david mcilwaine and andrew robb
3238252 i can only begin to imagine the impact these dreadful offences have had on them
3238253 but like the judge i can only assess the correctness of the sentence imposed on burcombe having regard to what he admitted to doing not what the families believe he may have done
3238254 i understand where baroness scotland is coming from she can only work on the information she has
3238255 depending on what happens in the trial shell look at it further i believe she can read between the lines but she can only go on whats being said
3238256 a regional pimm is a great asset since it creates thousands of jobs and millions of dollars for national and local economies a pimm also becomes a base for a country to expand its export market we are currently in negotiations with several interested groups that see the value a pimm represents
3238257 it was massive people were joining the procession from every locality after it started out from sopore after the attack on the police team at sangrama we decided to let them go and stop them at a place where it is manageable if we had stopped them anywhere near baramulla or any other town they would have burnt everything there was a lot of anger
3238258 this procession makes it very clear what people of kashmir really want
3238259 people are facing a lot of problems due to the blockade this is the only alternative
3238260 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3238261 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3238262 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3238263 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microphone is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3238264 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3238265 ich habe gedacht hey das sind die olympischen spiele und ich bin hier f r die vereinigten staaten danach war ich wie elektrisiert ich habe noch nie so viel adrenalin in mir gesp rt
3238266 ich habe ihm angesehen wie er ber seine schmerzgrenze hinausgegangen ist
3238267 nein es reicht mir zu wissen dass ich diese einmalige m glichkeit in meiner karriere genutzt habe
3238268 we have imposed curfew to ensure the peaceful burial of sheikh aziz

3238271 thats great i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100m mark that was my goal
3238272 i was a little bit surprised a little bit relieved
3238273 its not every day you feel that way you never get used to it
3238274 an olympic gold is an olympic gold the time the race none of it matters its all about the gold
3238275 i looked at the crowd on the way to the race and made an effort to take it all in i was almost skipping i was so excited
3238276 can we get a discount if we chop off his doodad great book him in
3238277 its cool to bring something to life whether its a song or a video but to do it and have it embraced by millions like lost thats insane
3238278 i worked hardest to bring the tech and content communities together it is happening
3238279 i got the chance to put washington and silicon valley together we are seeing an apollo project of a new kind of politics being built right now
3238280 if one were a flea market operator and you become aware that counterfeiting is going on with the individual sellers at the flea market you have a duty to investigate it why is ebay any different from that analogy
3238281 if i had the money id buy every book of this series
3238282 oh thats cool fireballs great whats that ghosts resistant to salt what the fuck is that about
3238283 in the colder months we end up with humidity problems with humidity dropping to 10 or so
3238284 it makes sense to re mix the air with outside air to bring it more in line we will still have to do humidification at times we know that but this will limit the hours of humidification
3238285 in the colder months we end up with humidity problems with humidity dropping to 10 or so
3238286 it makes sense to re mix the air with outside air to bring it more in line we will still have to do humidification at times we know that but this will limit the hours of humidification
3238287 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3238288 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump
3238289 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of parker foster aiken
3238290 most of the guys i dated were captivated by my heart but they had different ways of trying to get to me
3238291 lemme have an iced venti americano with six pumps of vanilla and leave room for cream this has been repeated from my mouth daily throughout the summer how do i say this in japanese
3238292 i am going to japan and korea i am psyched
3238293 we will be playing a bit of everything old and new and a surprise or two dan frank bello bass and rob caggiano guitar have this great samurai sword dance that they will do at the start of the show its very cirque du soleil oh shit that was a surprise damn
3238294 korea will be a first for anthrax we have never played there before
3238295 taking a medication that may cause drowsiness can put people at risk for nodding off behind the wheel and potentially harming themselves or others
3238296 its important to carefully read the labels of medications and understand the side effects
3238297 maybe i need to give you something bigger something larger to show you i love you
3238298 i wish there were words to tell you all it means to me to share my life with you but the closest i can come is to simply say i love you
3238299 it would be handy to have a little cheat sheet that clearly stated refer these cases with this info
3238300 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff
3238301 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
3238302 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
3238303 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
3238304 i am yet to watch a single wwe show where punk is treated like a top guy
3238305 raw was not just bad it was a i cant believe this made it on air type of bad
3238306 todd grisham did fine as play by play and tazz seemed to enjoy working with him
3238307 of all the talent they could have used they select the most talentless individual in the company
3238308 everyone is complaining about the announcement of mike adamle as the new raw g m but i think its a great idea
3238309 if they wanted to have a new take on the g m storyline they should have thrown several million bucks at brett favre
3238310 hopefully adamle has been acting out of place for the past few months because hes got some real heel talent up his sleeve
3238311 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
3238312 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff
3238313 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
3238314 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
3238315 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3238316 if we can demonstrate that the ridge is part of the north american continent the danes can use that information to show it is also part of greenland
3238317 they can use it to define their outer limits to the east and we can use it define outer limits to the west and we both benefit
3238318 this allows canada to establish its outer limits once and for all
3238319 that gives canada the exclusive rights to develop the natural resources on and below the seabed in that area
3238320 all these different programs are designed to be open and solicit feedback and also be useful to projects beyond the mozilla project
3238321 we did look at exploitability at the very beginning and we decided that was a factor that is hard to capture and not all that useful

3238329 he once did want to get married settle down and have a kids when his former wife shot him to death because of a lie she promoted all his hopes died with his body hed rather live life cold hearted and alone then to be hurt like that again it doesnt explain why he is an asshole but it explains why he is the way he is with his love life abby if he is asking its for real he really wants to give this love thing a second chance in 80 or so years your the first person he stook around with and didnt run away from

3238333 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time

3238344 the year of the great seventh number accomplished it will appear at the time of the games of slaughter not far from the age of the great millennium when the dead will come out of their graves
3238345 this could refer to the seven year tribulation which could well be the time from 9 11 01 to 9 11 08 at the time of the olympic games not far from the age of the great millennium the beginning of the third millennium in 2000 2001 and armageddon when many dead saints are suppose to
3238346 most of the main roads in the provinces are covered with thick a layer of mud from landslides so it is very difficult for vehicles to move around
3238347 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3238348 our problem now is we cant get in because of the security aspect we are being prevented from going in by the international committee of the red cross because of the unstable situation
3238349 a little bit of shock and probably more relief i guess
3238350 it has been a long journey its been a long eight years
3238351 and i think just a lot of relief that the training was definitely worth it i couldnt care less about the time
3238352 an olympic gold is an olympic gold it really didnt matter how it went how i raced i couldnt care less
3238353 i woke up and i was just so excited i think i was excited about racing
3238354 i was almost skipping out there i was so excited i really enjoyed it
3238355 i think ive enjoyed it so much i think i would hate to finish and know there was still a flame burning inside
3238356 i think ive still got so much more growing to do and so much more learning
3238357 amanda beards on her fourth olympics so its certainly not out of the question
3238358 olympic golds are important but in terms of personal experience and in terms of personal growth i think that was my most important swim
3238359 olympic gold is really nice its what we all come here for
3238360 and i think that will still reign over this olympic gold because i found out so much of myself
3238361 after athens i learned so much and that was my first individual world championship gold
3238362 i think that one probably still is more important to me than this
3238363 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3238364 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several us diplomats it is a real shame
3238365 let it be a un mandated international force ideally eu
3238366 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3238367 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3238368 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3238369 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3238370 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3238371 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
3238372 if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction
3238373 it says i have a text message whats that and how do i read it
3238374 individuals who have the courage to redefine their roles and be true to themselves
3238375 hal tersebut tidak salah karena sesuai dengan undang undang sisdiknas no 20 tahun 2003 dan peraturan pemerintah pp no 19 tahun 2005 tentang standar nasional pendidikan
3238376 like most of my family maria doesnt understand that capitalism is based on credit and the availability of credit so i told her and now she understands

3238425 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3238426 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3238427 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3238428 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3238429 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3238430 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3238431 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3238432 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3238433 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3238434 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3238435 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3238436 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3238437 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3238438 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3238439 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3238440 we went down there thinking that the time trials would be straight up like theyve been in the past for the north south
3238441 they decided to change it to group qualifying drivers time trialed only against the 15 16 rivals in their respective groups once we got there and i dont agree with that ive never been a fan of group qualifying because its too much luck of the draw so if i knew thats what they were gonna do i wouldnt even have gone down
3238442 we were 17 th fastest overall 17 962 seconds which wouldve put us on the pole for a heat race if it was a straight up format instead we started sixth in a saturday night heat because we were in the fastest group
3238443 if theyre gonna do things the way they did them this year
3238444 then that was my last time there for that race
3238445 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche

3238452 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3238506 malgr ce que certains ont sugg r nous navons re u aucun renseignement nous indiquant que des terroristes se pr paraient attaquer notre patrie en se servant davions comme de missiles

3238512 les services de renseignement taient au courant de nombreuses menaces indiquant que des terroristes pourraient utiliser des avions comme des armes contre les etats unis bien que le gouvernement ait clam apr s le 11 septembre que les attaques contre le world trade center et le pentagone taient surgies de nulle part

3238522 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3238523 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3238524 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3238525 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3238526 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3238527 youll see the rules get to a point where you could argue theyre standardized
3238528 our players are going out now past the international line
3238529 i dont see that eventually going to 23 9 being a problem
3238530 weve seen one example in the wnba where theyve gone from a longer clock to the 24 second clock fairly seamlessly having seen it work there the likelihood of it working in the ncaa and maintaining the quality of the game getting quality shots and quality plays i think is good
3238531 so i told the coach i wanted to play football but it was really just so i could take my pads and helmet to school
3238532 money was tight we didnt have the things a lot of people had
3238533 i grew up in the city and all of a sudden i was in the country
3238534 i drove by a bunch of cows and horses and said what am i doing out
3238535 going to class it was all these different people the way they talked the way they acted i was already bigger than most of the offensive linemen id go to class and they were like who is
3238536 you learn that youre only given a certain number of chances
3238537 if you keep going back to the same things you were doing it shows that you dont learn from anything youre not a person that people can count on its all about respect and you can lose that respect people wont look up to you
3238538 you sure you want me rey maualuga not taylor mays not brian cushing
3238539 you know people expect me to be this ferocious hitter this ferocious guy who goes out and gets drunk and beats people up its just something im trying to change i dont go out as much i just go out with friends come home early and go to sleep im trying to change that perception of me
3238540 i didnt know him his freshman year when some things happened
3238541 rey has done a marvelous job of putting his world in order
3238542 hes a very good student he works out like crazy hes diligent hes a wonderful kid in the program
3238543 we struggled with him through the illness and passing of his father he took it so seriously he just needed us there was a necessity to have a close relationship
3238544 i mean its life stuff happened he needed some support he was away from his family and all that but now hes just found a real good rhythm im really excited to see his growth and maturity
3238545 because he gave me a bloody lip last year i dropped back and former usc defensive end lawrence jackson got a hold of me i kind of got away from him but as soon as i turned around rey was right there and hit me good right up under the chin
3238546 hes probably the most feared guy in the pac 10
3238547 i want to be a person the offense game plans around
3238548 i want to see that quarterback stare into my eyes with both him and me knowing i might take him out i want people to fear me but at the same time i want to just do my job and not go outside of what im supposed to be doing
3238549 if i can come out this year and do exactly what i did in the rose bowl each game i can do some great things i have to have that mind set every practice every down if im tired i have to keep competing keep playing
3238550 is it possible yes why cant i do that every game

3238605 i heard the first part was good i havent seen the breakdowns yet ill have to talk to the coaches about that
3238606 i didnt feel bad but i didnt feel great either
3238607 its our first finalist since danyon loader in 1996 so its a momentous day

3238638 this is not an opportunity to talk about difficult matters privately or in a closed environment this is a circus it is a national disgrace and from my standpoint as a black american as far as i am concerned it is a high tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves to do for themselves to have different ideas and it is a message that unless you kow tow to an old order this is what will happen to you you will be lynched destroyed caricatured by a committee of the u s senate rather than hung from a tree

3238643 a new iron curtain is descending around the periphery of russia any chance of a new non russian pipeline out of central asia and into europe is pretty much dead
3238644 russia has demonstrated that its military is a force to reckon with that it can defeat a western trained force and that the west and nato will not act to intervene
3238645 t he u s dollars recent rise is largely attributable to market expectations of a bottom in u s short term interest rates coupled with a diminishing likelihood of further ecb tightening
3238646 we are going to look back with a similar bemusement at the pound trading at 2 10 and the euro above 1 60 and the australian dollar near parity with the u s dollar
3238647 i dont think people have bought into the idea that the dollar is in a longer term trend upward against the euro
3238648 just as you wouldnt expect to see a tobacco ad on a kids site or show there shouldnt be junk food ads there either
3238649 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
3238650 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform

3238662 the forecast for gdp will in all likelihood be revised lower perhaps even to show a recession in the second half of this year at the same time we expect an upward revision to the cpi inflation forecast for 2008 the peak will probably be in the region of 5 5 per cent the bank is unlikely to endorse market expectations of rate cuts over the next 12 months
3238663 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
3238664 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
3238665 most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
3238666 years of unsustainable increase in public spending have left the public finances in poor shape to cushion these adverse shocks
3238667 we went out to the major carriers and said can you give us a better price if we bring in our 58 000 students as opposed to a college of 2 500
3238668 everything we wanted was built into it for less cost
3238669 the bottom line is that for institutions to survive financially in the coming years they are going to have to adopt more business like operating practices
3238670 what we have done is concentrated every year on the more complex projects our members find it hard to do on their own because frankly thats where the bigger savings are
3238671 in five years we plan to hold about 1 million square metres of commercial space in central beijing which will represent 70 of our net asset value
3238672 but we are still very much focused on earnings growth and earnings growth still comes from selling properties the soho brand is about selling and we can sell at higher prices and faster than others it would be a shame if we dont capitalise on that so we will continue to sell
3238673 these are high net worth individuals who may have a coal mine or a factory in guangzhou and who want to buy downtown commercial property for leasing and for asset appreciation so we sell to them now we think we should move on to own a bit more ourselves
3238674 the summer is historically a dead time in recruiting so this has definitely changed the way were looking at how we fill our talent need
3238675 the smaller shops are realizing this is a great time to pick off talent
3238676 i think an average mba interested in investment banking is thinking he or she may need to look more broadly and i think the boutique firms will capitalize on that
3238677 theres a general anxiety among students now i dont think anyone trusts any of the companies whether its an investment bank corporation or a commercial bank anything could happen
3238678 we had a job offer rescinded from someone in the automotive industry so certainly there is risk across all the industries this year

3238680 we are quite happy with our business here in china
3238681 we also believe that this growth will continue for the next several years here in china first and foremost because our brand is extremely strong here

3238715 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
3238716 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
3238717 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
3238718 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
3238719 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
3238720 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present

3238730 we shouldnt be relying on drugs if we can alleviate or prevent diabetes simply by changing our eating habits
3238731 it is common sense to take a method and try it if it fails admit it frankly and try another but above all try something
3238732 somewhere this gets lost in that translation and women who would be at risk for an eating disorder anyway develop a greater concern and a greater preoccupation with weight along with rigid ideas about eating its a slippery slope
3238733 its not that these patients are unaware of the risks
3238734 they know they feel bad they know the risks are severe but their eating disorder takes control over their lives its no longer consciously driven
3238735 its a delicate balance between doing whats good for the patient and whats comfortable for them because many are terrified on insulin
3238736 we must help them to chip away at those fears and develop a clearer understanding of what insulin does
3238737 the initial health benefit and the improvement that people feel once they start taking their insulin more energy an elevated mood can be very motivating
3238738 if you destroy the ability of neurons to respond to insulin or if you take insulin away neurons dont survive

3238740 the international society should immediately get involved and demand that china stop the repression
3238741 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3238742 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3238743 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3238744 the uighurs are driving cars and motorcycles they have shops but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3238745 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3238746 there may be just a rising sense of resentment and disgruntlement that have led to these attacks on the police

3238760 the milf rebels have defied their own leadership and have refused to leave the area
3238761 it appears were dealing with the same bandit for two robberies
3238762 whats happening now in my opinion doesnt do anything to prove or disprove that
3238763 its a whole different issue you cant go by one month or one season or one dot on the globe
3238764 this wet summer is caused by colder than normal air thats up above 10 000 feet
3238765 so tornadoes are coming to our area most of the time its usually in worcester county and points west
3238766 as far as this summer is concerned this is all tied to the very persistent type of weather pattern we are in
3238767 we are in the area that has a colder than average pocket of air above us
3238768 and when you have that situation thats just asking for trouble that sets up a very large amount of instability in the atmosphere
3238769 the moisture is already in place but it needs a trigger the atmosphere has to reach a point where the air becomes unstable enough and the process of building a thunderstorm takes place
3238770 its like creating a cauldron of air really bubbling up there
3238771 its not unprecedented its similar to other summers maybe 50 years ago

3238773 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3238774 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3238775 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3238776 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3238777 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3238778 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3238779 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3238780 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3238781 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3238782 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3238783 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3238784 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3238785 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3238786 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3238787 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3238788 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3238789 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3238790 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3238791 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3238792 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3238793 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act

3238796 to bring our staffing level to that of our comparable counties we would need to add 28 additional deputies
3238797 weve sentenced people to having those overcrowded buses passing them up
3238798 the answer for more money for transit is not to not vote for transit for two more years
3238799 are expansions of service frequency on our 24 existing bus routes
3238800 is a problem today but our economy will recover it always does and will come roaring back and that will help metro bus service
3238801 unless you build additional highway lanes with buses youve got a more expensive system sitting in congested traffic so its really not a better buy comparatively
3238802 you need a rail system to provide another way for people to get around especially in urban centers
3238803 all these different programs are designed to be open and solicit feedback and also be useful to projects beyond the mozilla project
3238804 we did look at exploitability at the very beginning and we decided that was a factor that is hard to capture and not all that useful
3238805 we dont have a lot of evidence that firefox users are being exploited
3238806 it was not just adults who were dining but often numerous children eating out is seen as a family affair when children sit at a table and share food with adults whether it is at home or in a public place it instills in hem a sense of worth
3238807 help themselves from shared platters the mothers did not serve them what they thought they might eat the children made up their own minds it is a matter of course that the children will eat the same food as the adults
3238808 problems with childrens relationship to food now evident through over comsumption of processed foods parents who dont cook and the decline of families eating meals together around the table
3238809 id like to stamp out the kids menu in italy children eat the same as grown ups but in smaller porions
3238810 parents have kids going to dance gym and things but not helping with the cooking

3238816 our engineers use lenovo thinkstation workstations to help them design the next generation williams toyota fw31 race cars aiming to make them faster and more agile with greater performance than the competition

3238820 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3238821 it is an amicable arrangement and we appreciate and respect the issues that ruud has highlighted with the club and are very grateful for all the hard work he has contributed while with the organization
3238822 hopefully he has laid the foundations for future success for the los angeles galaxy
3238823 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3238824 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the la galaxy much success in the future i would now like to spend some time with my family before considering any other position in football
3238825 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization our commitment continues to be focused on not only winning the mls cup this and every season but to build a club capable of competing at the international level
3238826 this decision is the right one for the organization the right one for the players and the right one for our fans we thank alexi for the tremendous hard work and dedication he brought to his job each and every day
3238827 the existing regulations create unnecessary conflicts and delays the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3238828 listen mate all you have to do is change your pacing so you speed up in the last leg instead of slowing down and a medal will be yours
3238829 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3238830 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3238831 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3238832 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3238833 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day
3238834 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major
3238835 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3238836 it was the first time they werent doubling the post
3238837 anyone on this team could do it any given night
3238838 i dont feel the defeat today brings too much pressure
3238839 watching the game from the stands last night really motivated us
3238840 seeing lebron james block a shot with two hands off the backboard and just the way they were playing defense got us ready everyone came into this game knowing the crowd could be a factor
3238841 the kind who could kill millions and take down cities and countries and even puppy dogs and playgrounds
3238842 it sounds like something from one of those hateful independent films
3238843 dump him before you fall in love or else it will end with someone getting taken hostage or ditching you for a supervillan who melts her face off with a ray gun
3238844 sorry sugarbuns there can only be one middleman and hes it
3238845 dont get fresh with me pony boy or imight have to take you up on something
3238846 android guards who will keep protecting the island after the supervillan has died
3238847 love is not an impossibility for us its an impossibility for guy
3238848 i have a question why are you two in wet suits when im in this honey rider nightmare from thunderball
3238849 im telling the truth its only the facts that are changing
3238850 football is fun its always been fun to me i love football i always have loved football theres nothing else id rather do where else do you get to hit people and not go to jail for it
3238851 id hit your mother if she had equipment on id hit my own daughter when you have equipment on and youre on the opposing team im going to hit you so thats just what it is with football i love it
3238852 id hit her id hit my mama it dont make a difference
3238853 you got equipment on you step on the field between the lines youre ready to get hit theyre going to hit me so why not me hit them
3238854 my first year my head was spinning second year my head was spinning third year my head is still spinning it doesnt stop
3238855 its always something new youve got to learn on the run thats the great thing about being here you learn a lot youve got great coaches and great players around you
3238856 no shawns under everyones wing just like im under mike vrabels wing adalius thomas wing i still talk to ex patriot rosevelt colvin im under his wing you can never stop learning you have to be that sponge soak everything up thats just me thats what im trying to be to be the best im trying to continue to learn and learn from the best
3238857 i dont know if anxious is the word its a little more than that
3238858 for me personally its getting back from an injury shortened season theres a lot of anticipation
3238859 right now there are a few guys who are down and my job is to step in and make some plays and hopefully earn a spot on the team
3238860 no matter what team it is when guys go down and you have a chance to get on the field youve got to take advantage of it right away
3238861 i was literally there just for the playoffs just in case sam madison or kevin dockery didnt get healthy but they got healthy so i just pretty much helped out in practice
3238862 i got a nice ring out of it but i havent seen it yet my wife ronisa just got it in the mail so shes at home in los angeles wearing it
3238863 im sure a lot of guys here dont appreciate that he has a giants ring
3238864 im not ashamed but i dont bring it up much
3238865 i was impressed simply by the fact he was a quick study
3238866 he was able to step out there and step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up and actually get the ball around
3238867 i feel stronger i feel good and im ready to get the season rolling but theres still a lot of hard work and preparing to do
3238868 were looking forward to the season thats coming up and we look forward to finishing this season
3238869 he is way ahead of where he was last year with being able to participate in training camp
3238870 he has done well and it is good to have him out there
3238871 obviously we have a talented front and hopefully we can get some pressure on the quarterback but were a team and we cant have any weak links just because the front gets pressure you still have guys back there who can cover everyone has to pull their own weight and take care of their own responsibilities or the coaching staff and management will get someone in here who can get the job done the defensive backs looked good its still early at this point but i look for big things in the second game
3238872 saluto tutti i cittadini di bressanone anche io adesso sono un cittadino di bressanone

3238887 this is a good middle class neighbourhood for carrefour because western tehran with high population density does not have enough shopping centres
3238888 the shop in tehran will carry the carrefour brand while maf will be the licence holder of this brand
3238889 maf has sent the standards of carrefour shops to major domestic producers so that their products if they meet those standards can be supplied not only in irans branches but other branches of carrefour
3238890 the presence of a foreign brand for the first time will have a positive psychological impact
3238891 chain stores should be the last phase of economic liberalisation not the first
3238892 i am very happy that people from all over the world are addressing the needs of the underprivileged in india in committing time and resources to social and environmental needs businesses and non governmental organizations can play a key role in sustainable development i commend conergy and the lodge elysium masonic trust in their efforts to reach out to indias underprivileged communities this act of commitment dedication and compassion is both inspiring and also a role model for environmental leadership we need to do more and i ask more organizations and businesses to follow this example
3238893 it has been extremely fulfilling for conergy to be a part of this initiative
3238894 through our subsidiary suntechnics we have already installed several hundred renewable energy systems for environmentally friendly solar power and thus improved the living standards of more than 100 000 people in 250 indian villages till now more than 13 of the 600 000 remote villages in india lack electricity like dewri gowada most are located in remote territory which proves expensive and technologically challenging for power supplied through a public grid off grid renewable energy products such as solar powered home and street lighting systems thus serve as affordable and efficient alternatives while also environmentally friendly
3238895 indias potential for renewable energy projects far exceeds the current installed capacity of the current 144 913 megawatts of energy produced in india only 8 4 comes from renewable sources this equates to 12 195 megawatts

3238907 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3238908 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3238909 when you are training an elite athlete every aspect of their health and physical skills should be assessed and if possible improved it is critical that every athletes vision is clear and that their vision is helping not hindering their performance
3238910 scientific advances like the achievevision tm program offer new techniques to help our athletes perform at their peak we have incorporated the achievevision tm program at general administration of sports of china to allow eye care professionals coaches and trainers to customize vision care for each athlete and focus on the visual skills that are key to their competition
3238911 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
3238912 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives

3238942 satellite radio is more likely to become a standard feature in new cars due to a better product for consumers more choice and less confusion among customers over the long term
3238943 they kept each other on their toes i hope they keep their edge and dont become a fat and happy monopoly
3238944 the consumer will suffer because two competitors are better than one
3238945 when you have a monopoly it generally leads to higher prices and less innovation in terms of technology you dont have to be as scrappy when you dont have a competitor
3238946 the jury is still out on whether even one satellite radio company can survive these companies have been racking up some pretty substantial losses year in and year out
3238947 one of the arguments we made in opposing the merger was why would the government want to bail out two companies that made really bad business decisions
3238948 a lot of analysts and experts think that given the explosion of podcasting and the talk about wireless internet in the car theres a real question whether even a monopoly satellite radio provider is going to be able to survive
3238949 solid this quarter despite a retreating consumer and a higher percentage of ipod jacks in new cars giving us confidence that consumers still like the product
3238950 it is likely that churn will tend to be lower for the combined company as the a la carte offerings make the product more customizable and the increased offerings make the product more attractive

3238957 but i knew then that this player lin dan will become the worlds top player
3238958 both of us have come very far since that first meeting in 2000 currently he is the greatest mens singles player in the world nothing will give me the pleasure but to play against him in the final if this happens it will be a dream come true
3238959 he has grown into a great attacking player since our first meeting he is powerful and his speed is amazing and his skills are extraordinary that is why he has been dominating the world scene for a long time
3238960 i used to play a more defensive game but now there is more bite in my game since i followed coach misbun sidek i have become a more complete player

3238962 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3238963 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3238964 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3238965 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3238966 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3238967 you can look great in a swimsuit and still be a heart attack waiting to happen
3238968 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3238969 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3238970 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3238971 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3238972 im sad to see him go i guess i thought he was a good player i liked him

3238975 international roaming charges are the subject of complaints where prices are high making it very expensive to make mobile phone calls while overseas this issue deserves attention particularly as mobile data services grow and businesses come to rely even more on cross border access
3238976 numerous public and private technical studies referenced throughout this report suggest that international mobile roaming charges are unreasonably high
3238977 in the research data that we have analysed it is generally concluded that the absence of government supervision of international mobile roaming retail prices is a contributing factor to the current high levels of disparity between roaming costs and consumer prices
3238978 i would encourage anyone with an interest in this issue to read the report and make a submission to the inquiry

3239051 weve won the money for eleven different schemes which is more than any other council
3239052 the government wouldnt give it to us if they didnt think we would do it well

3239054 someone has to lead on this not everyone can lead and i got the money and i decide how its spent but if the government dont agree then there is no money
3239055 its quite ludicrous to suggest it could be spent at ward level because its not a local thing
3239056 at a time when so many people are talking about the challenging economic conditions and credit crunch it is really encouraging to see such a prestigious international company making plans to invest so heavily in this city
3239057 despite the global economic climate this announcement clearly demonstrates that birmingham remains an attractive investment location for companies of all shapes and sizes and they agree with our assessment that we are better placed than most to continue to grow economically regardless of events in the wider world

3239091 there are a number of results that are not in yet and there are quite a lot of reviews happening and results were received after the end of term it does call into question how accurate the results are going to be
3239092 these results are never completely satisfactory because the nature of the tests means that there are very high stakes and can cause a need to teach to the test an increase in performance can mean young people have got better at doing the tests
3239093 our members have serious concerns about the quality and reliability of marking and many papers are still not returned
3239094 the publication of national figures now reinforces their belief that the current assessment system needs change
3239095 regardless of the results of the key stage 3 tests i have no doubt that those whose agenda is for the tests to be scrapped or those who wish to cast doubt on the improvements in educational standards will be ready to use the announcement as another opportunity to stir up the controversy

3239127 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3239128 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3239129 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3239137 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3239138 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3239139 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3239140 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3239141 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3239196 the process of writing whether it be by hand or on a computer keyboard is closely connected with the process of thinking research points to the fact that thoughts are generated not merely recorded through the process of writing so my fear in relation to the rise of abbreviated forms adopted by many when emailing text messaging and instant messaging is that the capacity for deep thinking fostered through writing will be eroded

3239217 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them for his invisible attributes namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made so they are without excuse for although they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened claiming to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen

3239229 i have no idea what kind of moral value or rights we would give to those embryos well probably go through the same agonizing we did with ivf it could be terrible to begin with but then itll become a fact of life maybe 20 30 years from now well read in newspapers that someone made 20 000 embryos and studied their development and well decide its ok

3239237 in so many of our societies side by side with material prosperity a spiritual desert is spreading an interior emptiness an unnamed fear a quiet sense of despair
3239238 rather it leads us to meet the needs of others and to search for concrete ways to contribute to the common good religions have a special role in this regard for they teach people that authentic service requires sacrifice and self discipline which in turn must be cultivated through self denial temperance and a moderate use of the worlds goods in this way men and women are led to regard the environment as a marvel to be pondered and respected rather than a commodity for mere consumption it is incumbent upon religious people to demonstrate that it is possible to find joy in living simply and modestly generously sharing ones surplus with those suffering from want

3239307 when everything gets complicated and you feel overwhelmed think about it this way you gotta do three things first get the cow out of the ditch second find out how the cow got into the ditch third make sure you do whatever it takes so the cow doesnt go into the ditch again
3239308 when everything gets complicated and you feel overwhelmed think about it this way you gotta do three things first get the cow out of the ditch second find out how the cow got into the ditch third make sure you do whatever it takes so the cow doesnt go into the ditch again
3239309 why did i do it i think it goes back to the very first socio theory book i was introduced to at university
3239310 it really resonated with me and although it didnt set off a deep philosophical shift at the time later on i came to see it as a personal way to possibly look at the world around me there are ethical and moral pressures that come to bear on all of us whether as consumers or suppliers of goods and services or designers who are creating critical environments for people to live in
3239311 the pressure comes on one not only to behave more responsibly and professionally but to be able to have conversations with people that can evoke and challenge our understanding of how we might exist together there are so many fundamental basic human tenets that have been forgotten
3239312 the way i am working now is also very one on one i believe it not only resonates with the times were living in but also allows for a more considered relationship with clients
3239313 where they need the support they can pull in specific people they dont have to carry around this large organisation trying to solve a continually changing collection of problems with a sometimes compromised vision instead they can work from a small core group delivering the critical ideas within an ethical framework a framework that is in essence another word for humanity
3239314 you need to be able to navigate your particular community and be able to pull in the talent you need so the task fits the person unlike the traditional route where you have staff and you take the task and see if maybe they can do it
3239315 if you draw a triangle to represent your typical professional services firm and cut it in half the bottom half would represent the greatest cost centre thats the bit that agencies want to recover first and foremost and what the client pays for first as part of their fees
3239316 but its the top half that the client is actually going to the agency for the big idea the critical thinking but they have to pay for that bottom bit before they can even get what they came for
3239317 guess who can ride out a recession a lot better without denigrating the quality of the service to clients in the larger firms its the bottom of the triangle that gets cut in times like these ive made those cuts before and have had to remove good people the very people who made us what we were and it didnt feel good
3239318 theres an honesty that comes with it i have no problem being honest with my clients telling them i am going for a walk with my daughter in the middle of the day so long as theyre getting the quality of service theyre happy
3239319 instead of doing traditional advertising lunches i find myself going for walks with clients we talk because weve got time to and i find i attract like minded clients people who want to take the time to talk too
3239320 i dont need a bunch of other people in the room for a think tank we dont need a whiteboard sometimes all it takes is a walk along the beach with a client and a stick to draw in the sand
3239321 it wasnt a choice we just couldnt afford the rent any longer then we just couldnt find another space that was right le bon bolli was so specialised that it had to be the right space the right location the right look and feel
3239322 we fully intend to reopen le bon bolli but maybe not in the form it was
3239323 the idea behind the catering company was that we just needed to keep the brand alive while we worked out where to reopen the restaurant
3239324 and we needed cash flow we had the space already it was an add on to the catering space it just made sense to put a caf in it
3239325 and yes we serve crumpets we were looking for a point of difference the sort of thing we had with le bon bolli when the rest of town was doing focaccias and tex mex and we did classic french cuisine
3239326 it was actually quite cleansing i had been bitter about le bon bolli which had been my life i really hadnt wanted to go and i felt gutted after about a month of feeling sorry for myself i realised there was no point in moping around we needed an income and feeling sorry would just lead to being sorry
3239327 sometimes you get dealt bad cards in life its what you choose to do with them that matters and these sorts of things can make you look at things differently after 12 years you get a bit staid a bit too comfortable its too easy to take the easy road
3239328 then something happens to force you to take the tough road and it sounds clich d but sometimes the tough road is prettier
3239329 thank god i never allowed myself to stay with robert
3239330 you know what i dont want to be a christian
3239331 having the qualities demonstrated and taught by jesus christ as love kindness etc
3239332 man im about to lose my composure up in this bitch
3239333 i prefer to just fall into things and see what happens with the understanding that if something goes wrong at a gig its not the end of the world but this is the first time weve done festivals t in the park was just mayhem pretty special
3239334 the common link between the two is they can be pretty triumphant euphoric feel good
3239335 i stopped playing because i had no option i got told not to come back they told me id have to go or train with the under 16s i didnt want to quit but it turned out to be the best thing
3239336 i needed a nudge in that direction so i could wake up and go to bed thinking about and making rock n roll music
3239337 i still do the same thing now only i put them into songs ive always had the same mindset
3239338 at school i won a competition for a poem i wrote about how bad the school dinners were it stuck in my mind for years afterwards because i was always getting bad reports at school never won anything
3239339 when i saw oasis i thought that looks like a good way to live they made me and a lot of other people believe we could do the same thing
3239340 but i thought she should be in the band shes a brave girl
3239341 she sells our merchandise now i wanted to write about two people showing compassion to each other its not revealed that its about a social worker until the end it could be about two lovers
3239342 i could have called it denise after my sister who was also a social worker but there was the blondie song with a similar name
3239343 i think anybody with half a brain who reads the lyrics to the song will know exactly what its about
3239344 if you are writing about this sort of stuff there are always going to be people who will take it the wrong way
3239345 the song is too important for that man it has too much of a positive effect not to write it
3239346 i had a copy of johnny cashs album at folsom prison before i wrote any songs and knew i wanted to play in jail
3239347 im always going to cherish the memory of playing there it was everything a gig should be we have to be sure to do it again soon
3239348 there were elements of excitement and uncertainty i felt doubt and elation you need to be losing sleep over a record for yourself and everybody else listening to you
3239349 ever since i was a kid ive always found the glasgow accent really sweet and exotic
3239350 people might try to hide it because you dont grow up with a whole lot of cool things from glasgow but its a blessing to speak our accent there was never any question about not singing in it

3239375 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense 2 and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall be burnt upon thee 3 and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out
3239376 and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him
3239377 and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am 15 then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread
3239378 god told me not to eat or drink but to go home by a different way
3239379 i am a prophet also and an angel spake unto me by word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him
3239380 well i guess god changed his mind surely this respected old prophet would not have chased me down if an angel had not truly spoken to him
3239381 and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and has not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee 22 but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers

3239386 they know somethings wrong with you because shy and independent dont go hand in hand
3239387 be strong and of good courage for you must go with this people to the land which the lord has sworn to their fathers to give them and you shall cause them to inherit it 8 and the lord he is the one who goes before you he will be with you he will not leave you nor forsake you do not fear nor be dismayed
3239388 to guard your heart for out of it flow the issues of life
3239389 you know you can call that number anytime you want
3239390 you two are helping me playtest my new idea for a role playing game
3239391 youre playing characters who are playing a role playing game
3239392 alright lets get started okay dave and mike your characters are sitting at the table looking at the gm youve made your characters and are getting ready to play
3239393 let me get this right were playing a role playing game where were playing as
3239394 are they playing as people playing a role playing game
3239395 now that wouldnt make sense why would your characters play a role playing simulation no theyre playing a sword amp sorcery epic
3239396 its to see how well your characters roll their dice
3239397 so i have this character who is essentially exactly the same as i am whos sitting at a table with mikes character whos playing a fantasy role playing game
3239398 gary why not just cut out the middle man and have mike and i play a fantasy game i could be a barbarian and mike could be an elven ranger
3239399 no thats what our characters are doing instead of pretending to be guys pretending to be elves
3239400 shut it mike instead of pretending to be guys who are pretending to be fantasy characters why dont we just pretend to be fantasy characters like any respectable dork
3239401 because thats ninety five percent of the gaming market what were trying to do here is shift a paradigm so to speak so can we get started
3239402 okay then youre all sitting around the table dave what do you do
3239403 well we roll on the snack and dinner table to see if everyone can agree on something
3239404 oh you actually want to order food i thought you were speaking in character
3239405 oh well mike and i already had something to eat before you got here
3239406 good for you unfortunately im not having fun ill bet my character will have fun because he gets to play as a guy with a battle axe who slays orcs i on the other hand have to play as a guy with nothing better to do on a friday night than sit around a table hungry pretending to be a guy whos having fun
3239407 dave maybe you dont quite get my vision for this game
3239408 i get it its just so trifling and dull an idea it makes my vision swim i mean its friday night we could be out at a bar flirting with girls
3239409 thats beyond the scope of the rules ive written up
3239410 i mean in real life you jackass i couldve hung out with that cute girl from work tonight and yet i turned her down for this
3239411 so if you were playing as a barbarian tonight that would be okay
3239412 oh for gods sake ive had enough of this im gonna call annie from work see if i can still hang with her later guys
3239413 how come i dont have cute female friends i can hang out with
3239414 oh right on the plus side that gave me extra points to put into my comic trivia skill
3239415 hell yes okay my characters going to reference a sourcebook and then have his character make a skill roll
3239416 the clubs have too many vested and conflicting interests and are not equipped to deal with these issues consistently
3239417 sadly that is compromising the values and the brand of afl football
3239418 with acts which are offensive to society against the law and which may involve police laying charges the afl should assume control
3239419 they should be dealt with by an afl appointed tribunal chaired by a retired supreme court judge
3239420 what penalties can the afl tribunal impose financial incarceration the death penalty
3239421 it is incredulous that mr jackson thinks it acceptable that after legal process has taken place afl players should face further deliberation by an afl appointed tribunal
3239422 or worse before due legal process has taken place lets leave policing to the police adjudication to the courts and law making to parliament
3239423 ridiculous suggestions which fragment every citizens right to natural justice and constitutionally enshrined rights should be treated with the disdain they deserve

3239426 there have been points where i was only playing in a band and then for a while i was only playing solo
3239427 truth is im not really completely happy doing just one i need the other playing solo shows helps me out with the band and vice versa each has a completely different energy
3239428 actually the songs were all written before i started playing with the medicine chest
3239429 some of them i did have in mind to be recorded with the band others made the transformation to being full band arrangements some i pretty much kept the way that i wrote them
3239430 i reserved a couple of them that i felt really didnt need to be touched i wanted those songs to be a good representation of what i do acoustically so there are a couple on there that stayed very minimal
3239431 certain members of the band are permanent some are semi permanent some rotate from show to show it keeps things interesting that way
3239432 you bring somebody new in someone whos hearing and playing it for the first time and that helps me because im in a position where im hearing things through a fresh set of ears i put myself in their position and its almost like im playing the song for the first time

3239451 he took this twenty two pistol hed bought to threaten terri and me with oh oh im serious the man was always threatening he wanted to use it you should have seen the way we lived in those days like fugitives i even bought a gun myself and i thought i was a nonviolent sort can you believe it a guy like me but i did i bought one a gun for self defense and carried it in the glove compartment sometimes id have to leave the apartment in the middle of the night you know to to go to the hospital you know terri and i werent married then and my first wife had the house and kids the dog everything and terri and i were living in this apartment here sometimes as i say id get a call in the middle of the night and have to go in to the hospital at two or three in the morning itd be dark out there in the parking lot and id break into a sweat before i could even get to my car i never knew if he was going to come up out of the shrubbery or from behind a car and start shooting i mean the man he was crazy he was capable of wiring a bomb to my car anything he used to call my answering service at all hours and say he needed to talk to the doctor and when id return the call hed say son of a bitch your days are numbered little things like that it was scary im telling you
3239452 he shot himself in the mouth in his room someone heard the shot and told the manager they came in with a passkey saw what had happened and called an ambulance i happened to be there when they brought him in to the emergency room i was there on another case he was still alive but past recall beyond anything anyone could do for him the man still he lived for three days his im serious though his head swelled up to twice the size of a normal head id never seen anything like it and i hope i never do again terri wanted to go in and sit with him when she found out about it we had a fight over it i didnt think she should d want to s ee him like that i didnt think she should see him and i still dont
3239453 i was in the room with him when he died
3239454 he never came up out of it but regained consciousness and there was no hope for him but i sat with him he didnt have anyone else
3239455 sure it was abnormal in most peoples eyes but but he was willing to die for it he did die for it
3239456 i mean no one knows what he did it for
3239457 we were afraid mel herb even made a will out and wrote to his brother in california who used to be a green beret mel he told him who to look for if something happened to him mysteriously or not so mysteriously
3239458 but mels right we lived did live a little like fugitives we were were afraid of him no question mel was werent you honey i even called the police at one point but they were no help they said they couldnt do anything until ed to him they couldnt arrest him or do anything unless he actually did did something to herb isnt that a laugh
3239459 we get along really well i think we like doing things together and neither of us has beaten up on the other yet thank god knock on wood id say were pretty happy i guess we should count our blessings
3239460 stop that now youre making me sick youre still on a honeymoon for gods sake thats why you can act like this youre still gaga for crying out loud over each other yet just wait how long have you been together now how long has it been a year longer than a year
3239461 terri jesus you shouldnt talk like that even if youre not serious even if you are kidding its bad luck here you guys
3239462 lets have a toast i want to propose a toast a toast to love to true love
3239463 i mean ill give you a good example and of it and then you can draw your own conclusions
3239464 it i kind of mean what im saying too if youll pardon me for saying it but it seems to me were just rank beginners at love we say we love each other and we do i dont doubt it we love each other and we love hard all of us i love terri and terri loves me and you guys love each other too you know the kind of love im talking about now physical sexual love that impulse that drives you to someone special as well as love of the other persons being his or her essence as it were attraction to the other person the partner as well as just the plain everyday kind of love love of the other persons being the loving to be with the other the little things that make up everyday love carnal love then a nd well call it sentimental love the day to day caring about the other person but sometimes i have a hard time accounting for the fact that i must have loved my first wife too but i did i know i did so i suppose guess before you can say anything i am am like terri in that regard terri and ed carl
3239465 there was a time when but at one time i thought i loved my first wife more than life itself and we had the kids together but now i hate her guts i do how do you explain figure that what happened to that love did that love just get erased from the big board as if it was never up there as if it never happened what happened to it is what id like to know i wish someone could tell me then theres ed carl okay were back to ed carl he love s d terri so much he tries to kill her and he winds up killing himself
3239466 you guys have been together eighteen months and you love each other i i t shows all over you you you simply glow with it but but you ve both loved other people too before you met each other youve both been married before just like us and you probably loved other people before that too even terri and i have been together five years been married for four and the terrible thing the terrible thing is but the good thing too the saving grace you might say is that if something happened to one of us excuse me for saying this but if something happened to one of us tomorrow i think the other one the other person partner would grieve mourn for a while you know but then the surviving party would go out and love again have someone else soon enough all and all this all of this love were talking about jesus how can you figure it it would just be a memory maybe not even a memory am maybe thats the way its supposed to be but am i wrong am i way off base because i want you to set i know thats what would happen with us with terri and me as much as we may love each other with any one of us for that matter ill stick my neck out that much weve all proved it anyhow i just dont understand set me straight if you think im wrong i want to know i mean i dont know anything and im the first one to admit it
3239467 this is depressing stuff this could get very depressing even if you think its true
3239468 are you getting drunk herb honey are are you drunk
3239469 all right i dont have to be drunk to say what i think s on my mind do i im not drunk i mean were were all just talking right
3239470 but if i want to get drunk i will goddamn it i can do anything i want today
3239471 let me remind you of that i am not on call i can do anything i want today im just tired thats all
3239472 i was going to tell you about something i mean i was going
3239473 well what was i saying yeah i wanted to tell you about something that happened a while back i think i wanted to prove a point you see this and i will if i can just tell this thing the way it happened this happened a few months ago but its still going on right now and you might say that yeah but it ought to make us all feel ashamed when we talk like we know what we we re talking about when we talk about love
3239474 you are too drunk dont talk like this dont talk like youre drunk if youre not drunk
3239475 will you do me a favor and do that for a minute so as i was saying theres this
3239476 let me tell this its been on my mind just shut up for a minute i told you a little about it when it first happened that
3239477 maybe so im constantly surprised with things myself everything in my life surprises me
3239478 it was in may or maybe it was june terri and i had just sat down to dinner when the hospital called thered been this thing an accident out on the interstate drunk a drunk kid a t eenager had p lowed his dads pickup into this a camper with this old couple in it they were up in their mid seventies that couple the kid he was eighteen or nineteen something he was doa when they brought him in taken hed taken the steering wheel through his sternum and must have died instantly the but the old couple they were still alive you understand i mean but just barely but they they had everything multiple multiple fractures and contusions internal injuries hemorrhaging contusions lacerations the works and they each of them had themselves a c oncussion s they were in a bad way believe me and of course their age was two strikes against them id say she was she was even a little worse off than he was ruptured she had a ruptured spleen and a long with everything else both both kneecaps were b roken but theyd been wearing their seatbelts and god knows thats what the only thing that saved them for the time being
3239479 folks this is an advertisement for the national safety council
3239480 so we took the two of them up to the or and worked like fuck on them most of the night ill try and make a long story short the other fellows showed up and we took the old couple up to the operating room and worked on them most of the night they must have had these incredible reserves those two old people you you see that once in a while so we we did everything that could be done and toward morning we we re giving them a fifty fifty chance maybe less than that maybe thirty seventy for her the wife so here they are anna gates was her name and she was quite a woman but they were still alive the next morning so okay and we move d them into the icu which is where they both kept plugging away at it for two weeks hitting it better and better on all the scopes so we transfer them out to their own room where we could monitor every breath and keep a twenty four hour watch on them they were in intensive care for nearly two weeks she a little longer before their condition improved enough so we could transfer them out and down the hall to their own rooms
3239481 we havent actually eaten there yet but it looks good from the outside you know
3239482 if i had it to do all over again id be a chef you know right terri
3239483 its some place they say its part of a new chain but its not like a chain if you know what i mean they actually have bookshelves in there with real books on them you can browse around after dinner and take a book out and bring it back the next time you come to eat you wont believe the food and herbs reading ivanhoe he took it out when we were there last week he just signed a card like in a real library
3239484 ive been having an identity crisis for years terri knows terri can tell you but let me say this if i could come back again in a different life a different time and all you know what id like to come back as a knight you were pretty safe wearing all that armor it was all right being a knight until gunpowder and muskets and twenty two p istols came along
3239485 mel herb would like to ride a white horse and carry a lance
3239486 there you go you know whats what dont you nick
3239487 also youd carry around their perfumed hankies with you wherever you rode did they have perfumed hankies in those days it doesnt matter some little forget me not a token thats what im trying to say you needed some token to carry around with you in those days anyway whatever it was better in those days being a knight than a serf
3239488 suppose you came back as a serf the serfs didnt have it so good in those days
3239489 but i guess even the knights were vessels to someone isnt that the way it worked
3239490 what the fucks the difference you vassals vessels ventricles vas deferens well you knew what i meant anyway all right youre all better educated in these matters than i am
3239491 so im not educated i learned my stuff im a heart surgeon sure but really im just a mechanic i just go in and i fuck around and i fix things that go wrong with the body im just a mechanic shit
3239492 but sometimes they suffocated in all that armor mel herb theyd even have heart attacks if it got too hot and they were too tired and worn out i read somewhere that theyd fall off their horses and not be able to get up because they were too tired to stand with all that armor on them they got trampled by their own horses sometimes
3239493 thats a terrible image nicky i guess theyd just lay there then and wait until somebody someone the enemy came along and made a shish kebab kabob out of them
3239494 the last we heard they were just getting out of intensive care
3239495 dont honey dont always be so serious sweetie please go on with the story i was joking for gods sake cant you take a joke
3239496 if i werent in love with you i damn sure well wouldnt be here in the first place you can bet on it honey what do you say finish your story then well go to that new place okay the library okay
3239497 when they were finally out of the woods we were able to move them out of intensive care after we could see they were going to make it i dropped in to see each of them every day sometimes twice a day if i was up doing other calls anyway c they were both in c asts and bandages head to foot the both of them you know youve seen it in the movies even if you havent seen the real thing but they were bandaged head to foot man and i mean head to foot thats just the way they looked just like those phony actors in the movies after some big disaster little eye holes and nose holes and mouth holes but this was the real thing their heads were bandaged they just had eye holes and a place for their mouths and noses and she had to have her legs slung up on top of it well the husband anna gates had to have her legs elevated too she was worse off than he was i told you that both of them were on intravenous and glucose for a time well henry gates was very depressed for the longest while even after he found out that his wife was going to pull through and recover he was still very depressed not just about the accident itself though of course that had gotten to him as those things will i mean the accident was one thing but it wasnt everything id get up to his mouth hole you know and hed say no it wasnt the accident exactly but it was because he couldnt see her through his eye holes he said that was what was making him feel so bad can you imagine im telling you the mans heart was breaking because he couldnt turn his goddamn head and see his goddamn wife
3239498 i mean it was killing the old fart just becayse he couldnt look at the fucking woman
3239499 id sit a while every day beside the bed hed lay there in his bandages staring out the window at the foot of his bed the window was too high for him to see anything except the tops of trees thats all he saw for hours at a stretch he couldnt turn his head without assistance and he was only allowed to do that twice a day each morning for a few minutes and every evening he was allowed to turn his head but during our visits he had to look at the window when he talked id talk a little ask a few questions but mostly id listen he was very depressed what was most depressing to him after he was assured his wife was going to be all right that she was recovering to everyones satisfaction what was most depressing was the fact they couldnt be physically together that he couldnt see her and be with her every day he told me theyd married in 1927 and since that time theyd only been apart from each other for any time on two occasions even when their children were born they were born there on the ranch and henry and the missus still saw each other every day and talked and were together around the place but he said theyd only been away from each other for any real time on two occasions once when her mother died in 1940 and anna had to take a train to st louis to settle matters there and again in 1952 when her sister died in los angeles and she had to go down there to claim the body i should tell you they had a little ranch seventy five miles or so outside of bend oregon and thats where theyd lived most of their lives theyd sold the ranch and moved into the city of bend just a few years ago when this accident happened they were on their way down from denver where theyd gone to see his sister they were going on to visit a son and some of their grandchildren in el paso but in all of their married life theyd only been apart from each other for any length of time on just those two occasions imagine that but jesus he was lonely for her im telling you he pined for her i never knew what that word meant before pined until i saw it happening to this man he missed her something fierce he just longed for her company that old man did of course he felt better hed brighten when id give him my daily report on annas progress that she was mending that she was going to be fine just a question of a little more time he was out of his casts and bandages now but he was still extremely lonely i told him that just as soon as he was able maybe in a week id put him into a wheelchair and take him visiting take him down the corridor to see his wife meanwhile i called on him and wed talk he told me a little about their lives out there on the ranch in the late 1920s and during the early thirties
3239500 he told me that in the winter it would do nothing but snow and for maybe months at a time they couldnt leave the ranch the road would be closed
3239501 when hed recovered enough to be moved in a wheelchair his bandages were long gone by then a nurse and i wheeled him down the corridor to where his wife was hed shaved that morning and put on some lotion he was in his bathrobe and hospital gown he was still recovering you know but he held himself erect in the wheelchair still he was nervous as a cat you could see that as we came closer to her room his color rose and he got this look of anticipation to his face a look i cant begin to describe i pushed his chair and the nurse walked along beside me she knew something about the situation shed picked up things nurses you know theyve seen everything and not much gets to them after a while but this one was strung a little tight herself that morning the door was open and i wheeled henry right into the room mrs gates anna she was still immobilized but she could move her head and her left arm she had her eyes closed but they snapped open when we entered the room she was still in bandages but only from the pelvic area down i pushed henry up to the left side of her bed and said you have some company anna company dear but i couldnt say any more than that she gave a little smile and her face lit up out came her hand from under the sheet it was bluish and bruised looking henry took the hand in his hands he held it and kissed it then he said hello anna hows my babe remember me tears started down her cheeks she nodded ive missed you he said she kept nodding the nurse and i got the hell out of there she began blubbering once we were outside the room and shes a tough lot that nurse it was an experience im telling you but after that he was wheeled down there every morning and every afternoon we arranged it so they could have lunch and dinner together in her room in between times theyd just sit and hold hands and talk they had no end of things to talk about
3239502 you just said a little about it when it first happened you didnt tell me any of this damn you now youre telling me this to make me cry herb this story better not have an unhappy ending it doesnt does it youre not setting us up are you if you are i dont want to hear another word you dont have to go any farther with it you can stop right there herb
3239503 finish the story for gods sake is there more but im like terri i dont want anything to happen to them thats really something

3239521 zhang yimous idea is to let people all over the world experience the 5000 years of chinese culture so he tries to pile the chinese elements up the problem of zhang is that he does not have any sense of modern times and the future
3239522 he has no idea where the changes of china and what young chinese are thinking its sad that he wants to let people praise the countrys past hes like a pickled vegetable in a crock of chinese culture
3239523 regrettably these big scenes were empty and spiritless this is like a mouth with a tongue cut off it does not matter how wide the mouth is opened because you can only hear some unclear moaning sounds
3239524 zhang yimou once again staged a show full of chinese elements were simply stunned by the ceremony and can only fall for his skill
3239525 the symbols of the present day are not easy to capture unlike in the ancient world because today we are sort of one big family we resemble together
3239526 we dress similarly and the fashion and fads are similar and very close we are in the age of communication that is why if you wanted to find something unique in todays chinese culture it will be very difficult because we now become globalized culture

3239528 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3239529 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3239530 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3239531 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3239532 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3239533 it takes us a step forward it respects the result of the referendum
3239534 it doesnt allow whole deregulated trading across the board i think this position will be broadly supported
3239535 our view is that the current market price of omh shares does not reflect the underlying value strong earnings and future potential of the groups assets
3239536 we believe that it represents prudent capital management to utilise some of our existing surplus cash reserves to buy back some of our own shares which will ultimately benefit all shareholders by delivering long term value and maximising returns
3239537 the omh group has been generating significant operating cash flows from all our operations in australia china and singapore
3239538 as at 30 june we had over a 60 million in cash reserves and no material debt and the outlook for all of our businesses remains very strong with manganese prices remaining buoyant
3239539 it is important to emphasise that the share buy back program will not compromise our organic growth strategy which continues to centre on opportunities to expand production and increase the mine life at our 100 owned bootu creek manganese mine in the northern territory and advance construction of a dedicated sinter ore production facility at our qinzhou smelter in china
3239540 this is a unique opportunity for australia to take the leadership position in this

3239575 honestly they have a strong drive to be a well known brand in wedding photography
3239576 the idea is that we get past the concept of just dealing with things when they are in crisis and hopefully promote a system of addressing stress and addressing our ability to cope with it so we rarely get into a crisis mode
3239577 when we talk about operational stress were talking about that unique set of circumstances that people have when they are deployed or when they are in the jobs that they do
3239578 for example somebody who works on the deck of an aircraft carrier has a much different level of stress than someone who is a civilian and works in an office building downtown

3239585 id like to give you a piece of my mind
3239586 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

3239591 history teaches us that high taxes and protectionism are not conducive to a thriving economy the extreme case being the higher taxes and tariffs that deepened the great depression
3239592 i admit that cycling does have a problem and we have to deal with that
3239593 we are catching cheats but thats mainly because we are looking for them
3239594 the uci has been one of the leading international federations in the fight against doping which is not the case of some bigger federations
3239595 weve been doing blood tests on the riders for years in comparison fifa the international football federation only began doing blood tests last year
3239596 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
3239597 i will be hoping to talk with the wada chief while i am here and im sure well have plenty to discuss
3239598 the uci is comparatively small compared to athletics and football but we are at the forefront of the doping fight we have pioneered the biological passport scheme which is costing five million euros to launch and which is going forward
3239599 first of all its not the wada chiefs decision whether we stay in the olympics or not
3239600 and i dont believe you should punish a sport because it is finding cheats

3239660 sadly to date the public outcry has yet to yield a fair and reasonable lithuanian response if anything it seems that the harmful phenomenon of historical revisionism and distortion of which the investigation of the jewish partisans is a prime example may actually be increasing in your country in light of this severe and continuing problem yad vashem calls upon you to intervene directly and restore lithuanias integrity as an enlightened and democratic nation by ending the misguided investigations only by dealing openly and forthrightly with the full and complex truth about the past will your nation succeed in building for itself a secure and stable future
3239661 yad vashem will continue to welcome and teach lithuanian educators about the events ramifications and legacy of the holocaust thus reflecting and communicating our core commitment to the truth we shall continue to support these teachers admirable attempts to strengthen true democracy in your country and hope that they remain steadfast within an increasingly inhibiting atmosphere that they can now sense around them

3239663 there are currently 300 refugees from the city of gori about one hours driving distance from tblisi that have sought refuge in the countrys capital a number of these refugees have been taken into the vaads yeshiva in tblisi
3239664 it must be stressed that the situation in tblisi has currently stabilized with no food water or electricity shortages
3239665 the vaad budget in tblisi is approximately 55 000 per month this includes of course education housing and food costs borne in the soup kitchen
3239666 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3239680 most cancer patients feel a little bit apprehensive about how other people are going to react to them
3239681 and i can understand that because you do go through a lot of changes
3239682 particularly women obviously have physical changes during cancer therapies theyre not quite sure what fits them a wig a scarf how to apply makeup

3239700 having three guys running 9 7 in the same race its amazing
3239701 when you look at that field its about who can run four rounds right now there hasnt been this much hype around the 100 meters in a long time with three guys who can run 9 7 anything is possible
3239702 i think the world record can go under 9 72
3239703 when usain bolt ran 9 72 i realized in order to beat him i have to run 9 6 you just have to adapt to what people are doing

3239708 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3239709 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease

3239711 findings from this study suggest the significant role that built environment plays in either positively or negatively impacting our health and or lifestyle
3239712 34 of u s adults aged 20 and over are obese part of the rise in this disease may be attributed to our surroundings for example increased accessibility to unhealthy foods the built environment is also creating barriers for our ability to exercise many neighborhood areas lack parks and other recreational facilities and suburbs are often designed to discourage neighborhood walking simply focusing on encouraging people to change their lifestyles to eat better and to get more exercise is insufficient measures are also needed to improve features of the built environment which are often modifiable e g via changes in city zoning development policies to support people in making such changes
3239713 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels

3239717 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3239718 television watching and using computers appears to have little effect on the development of refractive errors our recently published comparison of age matched chinese children from sydney and singapore showed the same trend
3239719 the results of this study are consistent with an american study which found that outdoor sport was protective however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3239720 nearly 80 of all children invited to participate in the study enrolled to have their eyes tested which is important to ensure that our findings apply to all children

3239793 despite overwhelming evidence of rab and police responsibility for unlawful killings the interim bangladeshi government seems unwilling to address the problem
3239794 instead bangladeshs security forces continue to get away with murder
3239795 the officials responsible for killing moshiul alam sentu and others should be prosecuted and punished to the full extent of the law
3239796 unless those officers involved are held to account regardless of rank the rab will continue to torture and murder
3239797 the rule of law cant become a reality in bangladesh unless the very forces tasked with upholding the law are also bound by it

3239807 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3239808 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3239809 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3239810 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3239811 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile
3239812 not exactly the greatest hand of cards to have to play
3239813 all this basically means that russia emerges as a great power
3239814 not a global power like it used to be but a power that has to be taken very seriously
3239815 the complexity of newly engineered systems coupled with their potential impact on lives the environment etc raise a set of ethical issues that engineers had not been thinking about
3239816 our saving grace our inability to affect things at a planetary level is being lost to us
3239817 we need at least to think about what we are doing while we are doing it to be aware of the consequences of our research
3239818 it leaves the door open for people to do something that is going to cause long term problems
3239819 the question now is how best to begin that discussion among the scientists to encourage them to do something like this then figure out what would be the right mechanism who would fund it what form would recommendations take all those details
3239820 scientists and engineers should not be involved in these kinds of ethical questions
3239821 even beginning the discussion putting geoengineering on the table and beginning the scientific work could in itself make us less concerned about all the things that we need to start doing now
3239822 maladapted for situations that call for focused research to resolve societal issues that need to be faced with some urgency
3239823 the sooner there is an opportunity for public discussion the better
3239824 not well designed to handle issues that are not already in a crisis
3239825 with no grand debate over first principles and no accusations of acting in bad faith nanotechnology has received only fitful attention
3239826 to understand the consequences of our inventions while we are in the rapture of discovery
3239827 we have yet to come to terms with the fact that the most compelling 21st century technologies robotics genetic engineering and nanotechnology pose a different threat than the technologies that have come before they are so powerful they can spawn whole new classes of accidents and abuses
3239828 dedicated scientists and doctors may pursue research that some members of society find repugnant
3239829 to have a broad understanding of science and an appreciation of its potential for good
3239830 modes of knowing that are often pushed aside in expanding scientific understanding and technological capacity
3239831 do we recognize when we might be putting ourselves on a negative technological treadmill by moving in one direction rather than another
3239832 there are social questions we should be paying attention to that we should see as important
3239833 not just getting the ship up and running but doing new stuff that noaas never done before
3239834 the folks on shore can participate as through they were on the ship they can request things from us they can control the expedition
3239835 it appears that barons cash was used to silence or hush mr edwards mistress in an effort to deceive the public into believing edwards was the candidate of working families by concealing an extramarital affair to which edwards now admits to having
3239836 although almost all of our customers will see higher bills next year weve structured the rates so that customers who make smart choices by reducing reusing and composting will be able to lessen the cost impact of the rate increase and help the environment
3239837 well tear the whole thing apart and say whats driving what part of the rate increase what can things can be postponed or modified or changed
3239838 a huge part of it the rate increase is just the inflation over the past 10 years thats probably the most important part of the rate increase
3239839 in the long run we expect zero waste will produce significant savings for people as well as protecting the environment
3239840 you buy one tower you beef up the memory on it then you can buy a box and you can add three more computer systems to that one tower using the hard drive off of that one computer youre buying one tower three monitors three keyboards and three mouses and that brings in four computers to the classroom for about 1 700 whereas one tower would be between 800 and 1 000 its a good way to get more into the classroom for the students to use without the expenditure being too high
3239841 this year we will have the access grant at demopolis high school
3239842 say for example we have a very good spanish teacher here and another school doesnt
3239843 she could be the teacher for our classroom and that school could join in and use the same teacher through the video conference we also just ordered 40 projectors for westside elementary and weve ordered the ceiling mounts and they should be coming in the next week or two we are making strides
3239844 we are using the computers in our graphic arts class
3239845 we are learning how to use adobe photoshop we hope to be able to create art to put up in the school and use it to make posters and publications
3239846 sherry feller and i were at the sti conference at port clear last january and we heard about this technology
3239847 another company had it on display and i could see how it worked we talked it over and were able to get better prices with more memory than what we had before so we were able to cut our costs there
3239848 and each time i realized i had a lot more questions than answers there are so many sides to the issue and all of them are right in their own way but the whole picture is complex and troubling i hope that there are good answers out there but as yet i dont know what they are
3239849 english doesnt borrow from other languages english follows other languages down dark alleys knocks them over and goes through their pockets for loose grammar
3239850 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3239851 it was fast he was covered in toilet paper and paper ignites fast
3239852 it went all the way around and caught him on fire and he went crazy
3239853 he was on the ground rolling around and i knocked off the garbage can lid and grabbed a bunch of old cups and filled them up with water and just started dumping them all over the fire
3239854 its amazing how fast fire gets away i dont think any of the boys had any idea that the toilet paper would burn so quickly

3239901 she was in a coma for quite some time before they rescued her and taken aboard the ship and put on life support mr paver said
3239902 she is off life support machines now but she is still not very well and they are going to keep her on there until they can move her and then i think she is going by helicopter to port moresby and then flying back to australia
3239903 she is a fit person who looks after her family and cares about other people obviously otherwise she wouldnt have gone over there

3239906 its my own recommendation as an educator that we need those jobs thats the bottom line
3239907 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3239908 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3239909 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3239910 it would be handy to have a little cheat sheet that clearly stated refer these cases with this info
3239911 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3239912 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3239913 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children

3239917 putting on the line the slaughter of communities deviously invoking the bangsamoros rightful claim to their homeland and the peace process in laying the carefully calculated plan for charter change cannot be anything but mass murder and outright treachery
3239918 the problems in mindanao are deeply rooted and federalism especially when it is raised with sinister intentions to entrench oneself further into power cannot resolve this it cannot even be seen as a step towards the resolution of conflict clearly the call for federalism is meant only to give president arroyo the much needed opportunity to mess with the constitution and assure the extension of her term
3239919 the arroyo government is the last entity in the universe that we can trust with amending the constitution whether surgical or extensive we will exert all efforts to stop any maneuver towards charter change in congress

3239944 we are doing this as an experiment if it works out more hospitals will be privatised
3239945 the hospitals would be run more efficiently under a private player and the government can also bring down its expenditure
3239946 the involvement of a private party should bring down hassles that come along with a government set up
3239947 the project has been in the pipeline for a long time we have issued the advertisements inviting interested parties and will have basic details about the partnership by early next month

3239949 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
3239950 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous

3239952 international roaming charges are the subject of complaints where prices are high making it very expensive to make mobile phone calls while overseas this issue deserves attention particularly as mobile data services grow and businesses come to rely even more on cross border access
3239953 numerous public and private technical studies referenced throughout this report suggest that international mobile roaming charges are unreasonably high
3239954 in the research data that we have analysed it is generally concluded that the absence of government supervision of international mobile roaming retail prices is a contributing factor to the current high levels of disparity between roaming costs and consumer prices
3239955 i would encourage anyone with an interest in this issue to read the report and make a submission to the inquiry

3239987 what remains is an absolute determination not to be defeated by georgia and not to suffer the humiliation of having to abandon russias south ossetia client state with everything that this would mean for russian prestige in other areas vladimir putins kremlin made it clear again and again that if georgia attacked south ossetia russia would fight georgian advocates in the west claimed that moscow was only bluffing it wasnt
3239988 russias attacks over the weekend leave the west looking for ways it can exert its power to deter any further aggression the west is under no obligation to help georgia because it is not a member of nato
3239989 they were unrealistic to think the united states and europe would come to their military aid
3239990 as the worlds diplomats hurried to contain the violence and prevent the conflict engulfing the wider caucasus region russia made clear it no longer considered georgias president mikhail saakashvili a partner prompting accusations from his main ally the united states that moscow was resisting peace and wanted regime change
3239991 there are three basic facts to keep in mind about the smokin little war in ossetia 1 the georgians started it 2 they lost 3 what a beautiful little war
3239992 there is some truth in this analysis but only some in the first place russia may have behaved with shocking brutality but this was in response to georgian troops going into south ossetia there was provocation this tiny disputed parcel of land is admittedly legally part of georgia but it has been independent for 15 years and its population of 70 000 includes russian passport holders and many sympathetic to russia
3239993 first diplomacy president mikhail saakashvili of georgia is a headstrong fellow reference has been made to his harvard education as if that should ensure sound judgment alas however the presidents tutor was not the greatest of harvard diplomatists henry kissinger but anthony eden at suez mr saakashvili has only one defence against the charge of criminal irresponsibility a plea of insanity
3239994 no doubt saakashvilis government has been rash by daring the russians in their own backyard neither does georgia have the wherewithal to take on vastly superior russian forces nor is the west likely to come to its aid
3239995 i stand for being totally open about the existing problems
3239996 we in russia we cannot see how we can do business with him
3239997 the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces to their positions prior to august 7
3239998 to take further action as appropriate to help bring about and implement a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis
3239999 we have not received a clear answer today to that question
