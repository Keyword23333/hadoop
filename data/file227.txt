2270032 when we shot the scene the movie wasnt even out yet we literally just watched one scene in the trailer and sort of spoofed that

2270057 i dont believe the amount of wedding proposals ive been receiving on my website its more for jeet or yuvraj than for romit which is nice as they are loving my characters
2270058 im looking at jobs that are way lower than what i was once making
2270059 the money in the bank is going to run out if we lose this house what do we do what does my daughter do my dad i felt depressed and saw a psychologist the markets just so tough now
2270060 the hardest thing where it all starts to unravel is the effect of the difficult market on my self esteem
2270061 when the market is challenging like this all the drama is gone the hunt is gone and this eats at your soul
2270062 i love doing business and there is less business to do i am in mourning for my work life i worked hard to get to be a realtor it made me a professional and a success that bothers me worse than the income loss im so incredibly depressed by not having work
2270063 i am almost broke and struggling to get by from day to day
2270064 im having an estate sale for most of the furniture i have that i dont need my life has been ripped apart
2270065 ive been looking for a job since october of last year and have yet to find anything
2270066 i apply for anything as long as it meets my minimum salary and travel area i figured real estate would always be there for me
2270067 it is my hope to give the artists and new businesses in the area the feeling of being welcomed and have a place to show their art and many other creative talents
2270068 all children deserve a safe and caring place to grow and learn were grateful for caring people who work to stop child abuse and help children across our state
2270069 i just didnt realize how quickly how fast the market was dropping
2270070 especially at the end when we really dropped our pants down and i felt we were giving it away and we still couldnt sell it
2270071 take the life insurance money and pay for the house

2270085 never again never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the disgraceful way it was handled
2270086 ive been going to places that are perhaps very cynical about government
2270087 as president of the united states im not going to let anybody alone
2270088 if i had been president i would have ordered the plane crashed at the nearest base and id have been over here
2270089 i wouldve crashed my airplane at the nearest air force base and come over personally
2270090 i looked up and i said man that storm cloud is moving pretty quick
2270091 i heard the fire trucks and said those arent clouds
2270092 is because i believe we shouldnt do this by resolution its a one time vote that doesnt allow public discussion
2270093 there was a lot of discussion about allowing smoking in the bar before we built it with regards to whether we had enough smoke eaters to take care of the smoke in the bar
2270094 an attack on the justice system the court system an attack on the institution itself
2270095 the cops are going to catch who did it and the courts still have records i dont know what anybody thinks they can get from this
2270096 maybe it will make all the places around here more aware of what kind of people are out there
2270097 two hundred people plus in our place that would be an easy target
2270098 obviously this person is mentally imbalanced has an ax to grind
2270099 unusual vileness to attack anonymously in the dark of night
2270100 now i leave this case in the hands of the good people you the jury
2270101 you go home a few times a year and say i made this a safer community you do it long enough you go home at night and say i may have saved a few lives
2270102 imagine a mother who believes she belongs in the world a mother who celebrates her own life
2270103 13 reasons why i should have been born in a different decade
2270104 a quarter of a century ago when i was in high school before the advent of atms dvds and personal computers when the woolly mammoth still roamed the earth ive spent a lot of time trying to grow up and im not so sure about the results
2270105 oh i cant believe youre almost 30 years old and have a kid
2270106 ai que chatice p estar agora a inundar a blogosfera de tristeza as pessoas querem l saber do que eu sinto
2270107 ill tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
2270108 your guy will be within two points of obama in the rasmussen tracking poll by the end of the week
2270109 theres a huge amount of money we need to raise and we have to be aware of that
2270110 my mortgage is at 5 000 dollars it went from 2 000 to 5 000 and the house is worth 60 to 50 percent less
2270111 so what im here to do is ask washington mutual to seek a return on my investment
2270112 we are hoping that in 2010 combat troops will withdraw from iraq
2270113 i say it looks more like a hairless cat with its head stuck in the ground
2270114 if i am not me den who da hell am i
2270115 the fact that were standing here tonight the fact that were able to hold this its just to prove no matter how far out your dreams are its possible and fair play to those who dare to dream and dont give up this song was written from a perspective of hope and hope at the end of the day connects us all no matter how different we are
2270116 what if i come back from a shitty day at work like today and just wanna listen to the stones roses like today fairly loudly
2270117 hours of design and research love and attention have gone into designing the handle on that mug
2270118 a lot of care and attention has gone into designing these packs to make them relatively easy to open the correct way up the seal has just enough strength to ensure nothing gets in or out of the pack and yet its not too difficult to pull the sides apart thus creating an opening the bottom of the pack isnt designed to be opened its designed with more strength to ensure less splitting
2270119 the u s is now the butt of a worldwide joke
2270120 all everyone keeps saying is get over it or that was so two years ago well were not getting over it and neither should you
2270121 why dont you become a wedding planner instead of blogging about it
2270122 why dont you become a wedding planner instead of blogging about it
2270123 this process will be continuous and ongoing never ending and permanent with recommendations for further reductions made only if conditions ever permit which i doubt will happen
2270124 this approach does not allow establishment of a set withdrawal timetable like what the familys enemies advocate however it does provide the flexibility those of us on the ground need to preserve the ongoing sectarian bloodshed and chaos our troopers have fought so hard and sacrificed so much to achieve
2270125 form a foundation for the gradual establishment of sustainable security in iraq
2270126 withdrawing too many forces too quickly could jeopardize the imaginary progress of the past year
2270127 our goal my goal is an iraq that no longer needs american troops
2270128 and i believe we can achieve that goal perhaps sooner than many imagine or i have previously suggested but i also believe that to promise a withdrawal of our forces regardless of the consequences for those struggling buddhists and hindus in the region would constitute a failure of political and moral leadership
2270129 why put kids in foster care theyd be better off if we took them out back and shot them
2270130 im certainly not going to be a supporter of mrs clintons and i have been troubled by the fact that you cant know what sort of president she would be particularly with respect to war crimes prosecutions of the previous administration
2270131 i kind of like politicians that are more in the dick cheney mold who say what they mean and mean what they say and dont know the difference between right and wrong
2270132 this smart great looking guy i sat next to in chemistry class
2270133 he didnt talk a lot but it wasnt hard to get him involved in a game of risk and feel that he was comfortable with it
2270134 as long as we were in a secure undisclosed location
2270135 part of what gave us confidence in the 1950s was we didnt understand the threat that lay ahead
2270136 now i think at least i hope we are more cognizant of the threats that face us we need to be aware that there are people out there who want to destroy us and destroy our way of life and theyre called democrats
2270137 theyve done the most important thing that leaders can do which is keep the country safe and secure
2270138 i think people are like me you know they are impatient they want our troops to come home we all want that
2270139 but of course if you look at the situation in detail like i do when i review our offshore accounts you understand thats simply not possible right now
2270140 obama veers to the right but does he need to take the constitution with him
2270141 do i want an entry level dslr or one with a little more guts to it
2270142 not what the picture is about so much as the technique used to create it
2270143 i would go hunting with him before i would go hunting with an adult that hasnt been out as much as he has
2270144 most people dont look at their kids at 10 years old to be shooting 20 gauge shotguns but these kids are as safe as anybody
2270145 i had to call all my aunts and uncles and grandparents
2270146 but i didnt think we would actually get like second or get even close to even look at first place
2270147 i think the stress of the first day and the difficulty of the targets kind of got to them a little bit
2270148 given the circumstances with the two fires were concerned about the possibility of more fires being committed as well as the safety and well being of our community members
2270149 there was a good bit of smoke coming out of the door of the building
2270150 mondays fire was a sad thing being a historical building
2270151 if not somebody is pretty brave to come back and continue their escapade
2270152 all the history is being taken away from us its a shame it looks like someone is definitely trying to cover up some evidence
2270153 it appears a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout that contributed to the accident
2270154 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2270155 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2270156 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2270157 shut down the companys unlawful operation before more people are exploited by the scam
2270158 once enrolled members who join the pyramid scheme earn compensation for each new person they enlist regardless of whether they sell any travel
2270159 details regarding price product offerings and the conversion plan are all under consideration but the company anticipates that its existing rta base would be treated favorably under its forthcoming proposal
2270160 would facilitate the companys expansion into additional markets by providing more comprehensive training and a new proprietary e commerce platform
2270161 consult in the planning and development of the franchise model
2270162 while defendants purport to be in the business of selling travel their real business is the operation of a pyramid scheme that relies on the sale of essentially worthless websites they refer to as online travel agencies
2270163 of the more than 200 000 consumers who purchased or maintained defendants websites during 2007 62 failed to earn a single travel commission not even on their own personal travel
2270164 while the vast majority of consumers made nothing selling travel defendants generated 73 of their net revenue of over 141 million dollars from the sale of websites and monthly fees
2270165 in short defendants sell an illegal pyramid scheme that uses the minor incidental sale of travel as a front for their scheme
2270166 there are legitimate multi level or network marketing companies multi level marketing can be a lawful business
2270167 contemplating the replacement of its referring travel agent rta business model with the implementation of a franchise operating system
2270168 existing rta base would be treated favorably under its forthcoming proposal
2270169 details regarding price product offerings and the conversion plan are all under consideration
2270170 i realize that many of you want more information about our july 14th announcement of the potential use of a franchise model
2270171 if rtas elect not to become franchisees they will be able to continue with no change to their status with all income opportunities and privileges they currently enjoy the downline genealogy and network marketing division will remain intact
2270172 we believe a franchise model of our existing business will be easier to comprehend and more readily accepted by the general public
2270173 additional tools and training for those who choose to actively pursue the travel business
2270174 many months of due diligence preceded our july 14th announcement
2270175 details regarding price product offerings and the conversion plan are all under consideration
2270176 while there are some things we are unable to comment on

2270190 i have never played something like this before its quite different and unlike me i play a conventional role who is very giving and selfless besides the new traditional and ethnic look that im depicting these days is like a breather after playing similar roles in the past
2270191 oh i do that and i do every other martial art there is too
2270192 we couldnt come over at all because my dad wouldnt let us and you have to meet my mom please meet my mom

2270196 the social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights for such notion rests on individualism
2270197 the social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights
2270198 i didnt want you kids raised with the belief that somebody owed you something
2270199 the socialists declare that the state owes subsistence well being and education to all its citizens that it should be generous charitable involved in everything devoted to everybody
2270200 let me have the benefits and let others pay the costs
2270201 we make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise we laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst we castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful
2270202 the president was not making any war plans and he wasnt making any declarations he wasnt even thinking about what he was saying
2270203 he was just making a point and the point is that we do not believe and neither does the international community believe that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons whether they are or not
2270204 that would lead to a very dangerous a potentially dangerous situation and potentially lead to a scenario where you have for instance world war iii but he was using that as a rhetorical point just words he could say because the microphones were on and he was confused not you know making a declaration
2270205 ive told people that if youre interested in avoiding world war iii it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon possibly by bombing their universities or infiltrating their internets
2270206 this sort of policy is what youd expect from a dry drunk cowboy shitheel and is a barrier for peace
2270207 some of them might not even be real i dont know
2270208 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
2270209 weve done a pretty good job of unifying our party
2270210 ive just started this process of getting together a list of names and having them rendered in extra large print
2270211 if i had a personal preference id like to do it before the convention to avoid some of the mistakes that ive seen made in the past as you get into a time crunch and maybe sometimes dont make the announcement right or maybe they have not examined every single candidate
2270212 if you were to quit your life and go somewhere else where would you go
2270213 i know economics very well certainly better than my many enemies would have you believe so lets clear that up
2270214 anyway what do you know about it you little jerk get the fuck off my bus
2270215 i have been involved as chairman of the commerce committee i have been involved as part of the reagan revolution where we cut taxes on rich people and restrained spending on poor people and embarked on one of the strongest periods of economic growth in the history of this country
2270216 hillary clinton and barack obama are up smoking crack and raising taxes naked and they think its al qaeda on the phone demanding health care more money out of your pocket
2270217 john mccain has a better plan grow jobs grow our economy not grow washington its 3 00 am time for a president who is ready to bomb iran
2270218 we have nothing to fear from each other although i have accepted secret service protection
2270219 we are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom promote the general welfare and defend our ideals
2270220 i intend to wage this campaign and to govern this country in a way that they would be proud of me
2270221 it is more than appropriate it is necessary that even in times of crisis we fight among ourselves for the things we believe in whether theyre true or not
2270222 i have a record unmatched by either of those assholes of reaching across the aisle
2270223 the environment for working together is clearly there and if you cant see that youre just fucking stupid
2270224 it would be that much better if they all knew you
2270225 the colossal cost of this war grows every day in lives lost dollars spent and to our reputation around the world
2270226 the choice is between a democratic plan for responsible redeployment of our troops hopefully in the next ten years and the presidents plan for a 10 year war in iraq we must begin to discuss the possibility of starting to think of a way to begin to end this war
2270227 our men and women on the front lines should not be caught in the middle of partisan disagreements in washington
2270228 it is far more important that they remain in the middle of the civil war in iraq
2270229 i know some in congress are against the war and are seeking ways to demonstrate that opposition without seeming rude
2270230 i recognize their position and they should make their views heard but dont fuck with my money
2270231 congress should not go home for the holidays while our troops are still waiting for the funds i need to keep them in iraq forever
2270232 im the new boy in town where can i go
2270233 dead people walking around thats like scooby doo dont they have dead people walking around
2270234 i face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations but i also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the american people i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation
2270235 what a different emotional register from john mccains obama seems on the verge of tears the enormous crowd in the xcel center seems ready to lift obama on its shoulders the much smaller audience for mccains speech interrupted his remarks with stilted cheers
2270236 my friends we live in the greatest nation in the history of the world i hope youll join with me as we try to change it
2270237 you dont have to tell me to be liberal honey it runs in my veins
2270238 i guess thats the only shot you know how to play

2270473 take therefore the talent from him and give it to him which has ten talents for to every one that has shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has

2270475 the 60s and 70s were not good to the original disney vision of the future
2270476 no future for you no future for me no future no future for you
2270477 it was very surprising to me getting to the future that nobody was all that interested
2270478 what i think it says is that we are nostalgic for a time when we believed in the future
2270479 its a bit of a cop out there was a time when the future was streamlined jet cars rather than create a new sense of the future they say ah remember when we believed that the future was streamlined jet cars its a feeling of connection to the future rather than connection to the future

2270485 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2270486 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2270487 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2270488 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2270489 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2270490 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2270491 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2270492 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
2270493 one would hope that at least there is a proper field investigation going on

2270546 the democratic front runner wants to have it both ways when it comes to foreign policy on the one hand the new york senator voted for the iraq war on the other hand she now opposes it sort of on the one hand she wants a firm deadline for retreat but on the other hand she says we cannot abandon the nation to irans designs senator clinton this is not the 90s this is the post september 11 world the commander in chief does not enjoy the luxury to conduct our national security by means of triangulation
2270547 it has nothing to do with the content of the speech it has to do with the with the venue this isnt the appropriate venue for that

2270690 and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil
2270691 but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us
2270692 but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel
2270693 then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me
2270694 but he answered and said it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it to dogs
2270695 and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table
2270696 then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour
2270697 o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy foundations with sapphires and i will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of carbuncles and all thy borders of pleasant stones

2270731 what is it that you want to show me o lord
2270732 one day a species of monkeys devised a way by which they could gather food faster this would save them time and effort and give them more food for every hour that they worked
2270733 then they did the same thing with their hunting they made tools that will help them slay better bigger faster and they got organized as hunters
2270734 oh good all this must have given them a lot of time to spend on things they like to do and to spend time with their children
2270735 no next came the need to do something about the cold they made the fire and they made clothes clothes would keep them warm in winters
2270736 but bhagwan all other animals are provided with skins that perform this function effectively why did you deprive only this species of a skin that saves them from winters
2270737 oh they had a skin all right they just wanted to be more comfortable than that
2270738 aaah more comfortable with a foreign element on our bodies all the time
2270739 after a while they forgot the comfort of living in their skin alone
2270740 the angel was silent this time they used to make sounds in a particular way that sounded better than normal talking they also used to make rhythmic sounds on things like rocks and leaves
2270741 you mean they made a job of something that was enjoyment to start with
2270742 oh they thought it would be better that way what resulted was that only a few of the monkeys could understand the new difficult compositions and what should have been for enjoyment became studies and learning
2270743 why couldnt they just think up new stories with time
2270744 dont ask i have no clue they just wanted to carry their past with them
2270745 so instead of enjoying the stories they made work of them
2270746 yes but wait it gets even better after this they came up with more time saving devices made of metal and much easier to handle and faster to work with
2270747 there my man you forget that the making of these implements became another job their maintenance their oiling and shining some people specialized only in this
2270748 then there was jewelry men and women wanted to adorn themselves with shining pieces of metal shell etc to look better
2270749 to look better what can look better than glowing skin and a healthy body
2270750 wait bhagwan let me guess the making and maintenance of these pieces is another job created by the monkeys right
2270751 you are getting intelligent my dear things went on like this till they became too many monkeys to hold in individual groups and they make social institutions
2270752 oh for example you take a female of the species and you promise to take care of her for her whole life while she bears your children and cooks and keeps home that is called marriage the starting of this union is celebrated
2270753 groan more work created why did these monkeys not just go out and enjoy
2270754 earlier fathers used to come home in the evening before sun down and spend time with the children then they created offices
2270755 offices are places where fathers have to stay until after sun down so they hardly get any time with their wives and children to compensate the monkeys decided that the offices should remain closed for one day in the week
2270756 bhagwan now you are telling me that in the pursuit of creating time saving devices they actually created more work and so much work that even their basics like spending time with each other were compromised
2270757 oh it gets better they wanted to get more organized they wanted to do things faster so they created computers
2270758 now they have less time than they ever had they have no time to eat no time to drink they breathe poisonous air and die earlier than ever of diseases created by them
2270759 lord what you are telling me is that this is a species of monkeys that thinks it wants to create leisure but has actually been working hard to create more work for centuries on end what is so funny about that
2270760 im just wondering how long before they figure this out
2270761 the guy who brings in his own banana syrup and then sits there and works
2270762 indeed you can often tell the bad guys by their unfortunate brand choices
2270763 a while back naomi johnson a communications professor at longwood university in virginia sent me her doctoral thesis which she described as a feminist analysis of the new wave of teenage romance novels
2270764 whose alterna anthem bridge at 2 12 still gets me its a good song to yell out loud in your car i mean with the windows up
2270765 there came a moment in the spring of 2002 when i had finally gathered together the twenty five papers that i would include in this book i was home in my house in concord and the golden forsythia were just starting to bloom for six months i had been badgering astronomers physicists chemists and biologists for nominations of the greatest discoveries in their fields in the twentieth century the original publication of the theory of relativity the first quantum model of the atom the discovery of how nerves communicate with each other the discovery of the first human hormone i held the stack of twenty five papers in my arms a century of scientific thought my eyes filled with tears
2270766 an appropriate manner and disseminate the message of non violence including through education and public awareness
2270767 with the serious fiscal challenges facing the federal government agencies must maximize their ability to manage and safeguard valuable taxpayers dollars
2270768 no one disputes the fact that government officials need to travel as not all work can be done behind a desk nor should all premium class travel be eliminated but the rules are there for a reason and the federal government should enforce them we simply need the necessary oversight mechanisms in place to ensure that taxpayers dollars are spent properly
2270769 the federal employees who like to stretch their legs while they fly need to realize theyve already stretched the taxpayers purse by 146 million agencies need to be more responsible with their travel programs and employees who violate the policy should be held accountable
2270770 what we propose to do over these next few months is to move from a situation where we have a combat role to an overwatch role
2270771 i am very proud of what our armed forces are achieving here i believe they have acted with great courage professionalism and bravery we will discharge our obligations to the iraqi people and to the international community and we will discharge our obligations to our armed forces who are doing this difficult job
2270772 the overriding question is whether there is any military or political benefit to be gained from the continued presence of our armed forces in iraq the answer is clearly no
2270773 if it is now possible to hand over progressively to the iraqi army and to bring more of our troops back home then he will certainly have my support
2270774 a week ago gordon brown gave only around a minute of his 67 minute speech to the issues of iraq afghanistan and our armed forces combined but today he is happy to use our armed forces for a pre election photo opportunity most people will see this cynicism for what it is our troops should not be used as a political football
2270775 a serious attempt to deal with the disastrous iraq war
2270776 i do hope after my crossing that more people will follow suit this line will gradually be erased and the wall will fall
2270777 about 7 700 years ago people started to burn woody crops and theres a very high concentration of charcoal there and a decline of woody tree pollen these two give us a very clear indication that people used fire to open the site for settlement and cultivation it wasnt just one burn but over several decades to maintain the ground for rice cultivation this could be the earliest paddy cultivation in the world they used animal bones as spades for example the shoulder blades of pigs which have a triangular shape
2270778 when we look at the diatoms species of green algae that thrive in sea water salinity was kept very low in the background of rising sea levels that gave us another suggestion that the humans somehow managed to have very primitive ways of blocking seawater during flooding you can see an abrupt rise in marine and brackish water diatoms which means that up to a certain point the people couldnt maintain the paddy fields because sea water levels kept rising and they overwhelmed the sites they abandoned the sites which they occupied for 200 years and moved on to other sites with similar marshy conditions
2270779 i greatly honor and respect the work you have done
2270780 they can share the fruit of chinas economic and social development

2270800 the spam wave is part of a larger category of unsolicited messages that rely on social engineering techniques in order to lure unwary users into installing trojans this type of attack seems to be extremely successful as the number of messages has quickly escalated over the last couple months in order to achieve their goals spammers usually rely on international celebrities and their pictures along with catchy yet fake news leads
2270801 angelina would own the part my industry friends tell me she has made inquiries about the role i can understand how it would pique her interest catwoman is batmans one true love shes tremendously popular with women because shes both a heroine and a villainess
2270802 i was pouring blood i threw myself at them put blood all over them and told them that i had hiv so they would stop hitting me

2270806 weve been together for four years now we have a child together if we get married then the press will start calling her number six
2270807 by spending time with the children brad is telling them they are very special to him and giving them a sense of security at a time when they may not be sure what their status in the family will be now that the twins are here
2270808 its two weeks and one day and the merge window is over
2270809 much of rc1 was in linux next but certainly not everything well see how that whole thing ends up evolving it certainly didnt solve all problems and there was some bickering about things that werent there and some things that mostly were but maybe it helped theres a ton of new stuff in there but at least personally the interesting things are the bkl pushdown and perhaps the introduction of the lockless get user pages fast the build system also got updated to allow moving the architecture include files include asm xyz into the architecture subdirectories arch xyz include asm and sparc seems to have taken advantage of that already
2270810 but its all shuffling deckchairs really are we actually merging
2270811 om shanti om landed into a controversy with veteran actor manoj kumar for showing him actually his body double in a bad taste

2270813 and we know that for those who love god all things work together for those who are called according to his purpose
2270814 everything will work out in the end remember romans 8 28 chin up
2270815 therefore god gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves
2270816 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
2270817 god did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he then not give to us all that he has given to his son through christs sacrifice we gain salvation by grace through faith
2270818 for i am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers not height nor depth nor anything in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord

2270843 the history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid the high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business
2270844 the fairness of taxing more lightly income from wages salaries or from investments is beyond question in the first case the income is uncertain and limited in duration sickness or death destroys it and old age diminishes it in the other the source of income continues the income may be disposed of during a mans life and it descends to his heirs surely we can afford to make a distinction between the people whose only capital is their mettle and physical energy and the people whose income is derived from investments such a distinction would mean much to millions of american workers and would be an added inspiration to the man who must provide a competence during his few productive years to care for himself and his family when his earnings capacity is at an end

2270882 the plugins appear to be wildly misnamed theyre just an internal abstraction layer which permits later feature additions to be added in a clean and safe manner certainly not worth all this fuss
2270883 that because the real plugins are long gone its just that neither the complainers nor the fanboys in this thread ever read the code or generally had any clue of their own
2270884 this is a very unfortunate tragedy not that his wife is dead but that now perhaps he wont be able to develop reiser4

2270947 i love all your posts thank you and follow them thoroughly smart they have indeed provided me some smart and good help in dealing with my team and other people again thank you i however have a question for you how do you handle unreasonable clients i am presently faced with such a situation where i personally think we need to be firm and clearly lay it out to him that his expectations mismatch the meager sum hes paying for our efforts we receive a monthly amount from him but to offer him the service he expects in return isnt feasible for us not forgetting to mention hes our bosss sibling my supervisor including my boss focus on not loosing him as a client and the money of course thus plan on adopting the approach of pacifying him by accepting his unreasonable demands for now and then later revisit the financials topic i dont agree with this approach and feel now is the time to be as clear as possible with the process and financials as it would carry more impact now as compared to a later time
2270948 need to be firm and clearly lay it out to him that his expectations mismatch the meager sum hes paying for our efforts

2270952 tux3 is a write anywhere atomic commit btree based versioning filesystem as part of this work the venerable htree design used in ext3 and lustre is getting a rev to better support nfs and possibly become more efficient
2270953 the main purpose of tux3 is to embody my new ideas on storage data versioning the secondary goal is to provide a more efficient snapshotting and replication method for the zumastor nas project and a tertiary goal is to be better than zfs
2270954 the biggest single piece of prototype work remaining to go from a simplified prototype to the filesystem described here is to extend the versioned pointer algorithms to handle versioned extents a challenging bit of hacking indeed transaction management at the vfs method level is also expected to be a major cause headaches just as it was for ext3 btree methods are pretty much under control
2270955 or did you mean hardware not possible afaik there isnt any other media than flash which is totally silent
2270956 from what i can see it is an absolutely minimal read only implementation
2270957 adding a read only for the start zfs driver for linux would be useful for various purposes and adding read only filesystems to linux is really easy
2270958 referring to the individual who started the discussion he added
2270959 when asked if this offer applied to anyone else christoph replied
2270960 but zfs is totally overhyped its not the holy grail and shure has problems be it in zfs fuse osx freebsd or even solaris
2270961 oh linux is released under a free license zfs is released under a free license so theres no problem combining the two

2270994 the study of marine mammal acoustics and behavior is an area of emerging interest for many reasons but there have been many recent advances including this recently completed study
2270995 we were fortunate to have some of the best scientists in these fields working with noaa on this pilot project it will take some time to analyze the data and see what conclusions may be drawn but in many ways this effort lays the foundation for more sophisticated collaborative efforts in the future
2270996 a month ago i had set out on what i thought was a mental journey from liberalism to conservatism i never arrived at the destination of conservatism never got to a point where my brain believed that all political and social beliefs could be conveniently filed under that one word or put neatly atop the three stool legs by the same token i had not begun the journey from a point of absolute liberalism so in terms of the experiment i had thought i was taking a trip from say los angeles to new york when in fact i was actually beginning in like provo utah and ending up in tampa or belgium or space or south lake union

2271001 i personally consider security bugs to be just normal bugs i dont cover them up but i also dont have any reason what so ever to think its a good idea to track them and announce them as something special
2271002 if linus finds out about a security bug he will fix it and check it into the public git repository right away but hes very honest in telling you that is what he will do so you can choose whether or not to include him in any disclosures that you might choose to make
2271003 regarding whether full disclosure is the best policy ted highlighted the fact that the debate has been going on for several decades
2271004 later in the discussion linus offered a succinct summary of his viewpoint
2271005 and here is explicitly how to exploit gt this problem
2271006 the real lesson is that the patch treadmill doesnt work and it hasnt for years this cycle of finding security holes and rushing to patch them before the bad guys exploit those vulnerabilities is expensive inefficient and incomplete we need to design security into our systems right from the beginning we need assurance we need security engineers involved in system design this process wont prevent every vulnerability but its much more secure and cheaper than the patch treadmill were all on now
2271007 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys

2271016 his candidacy is about renewing what america means to the world and to itself it is about a collective cultural healing especially on race it is about representing the next generation and americas less domineering but more inspiring place among nations it is about transparency in government it is about getting past this brutal cultural polarization for a while it is about putting reason back into our discourse after the emotional manipulation of the morris rove era it is about ending torture restoring constitutional balance and adding the power of words of great words to restore hope again
2271017 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term
2271018 that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place
2271019 look ive got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old
2271020 if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
2271021 for all his quirks and for all his unseemly past associations ron paul had some serious view about the gravity of the situation and a philosophy that was once called conservative and is now smeared as nuts history will be far kinder to him that todays chattering classes
2271022 i have clearly stated my belief that gays and lesbians are our brothers and sisters and should be provided the respect dignity and rights of all other citizens i have consistently spoken directly to african american religious leaders about the need to overcome the homophobia that persists in some parts of our community so that we can confront issues like aids and broaden the reach of equal rights in this country i strongly believe that african americans and the lgbt community must stand together in the fight for equal rights and so i strongly disagree with reverend mcclurkins views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the united states to ensure that america is a country that spreads tolerance instead of division
2271023 i was petrified of people finding out at the time i thought it would be the end of the world now in hindsight i wish i would have come out at that time because i wouldve loved to see what the reaction would have been
2271024 i was embarrassed the embarrassment wasnt that i was gay it was that ive known you for this long and i have been hiding this secret from you i felt like i had to lie to my friends there were many times early in our career where there were a lot of questions about everyone elses sexuality so when youre talking with the other guys you see how they really react one time we questioned because he had a gay friend and the reaction was wed be doomed if anyone knew about it that set it straight in my head that i would never be able to talk about it or tell anyone and i would just have to hide it when youre best friends with someone and you dont have a girlfriend for four years and youre not seen with anyone you sort of start figuring it out
2271025 tried to cut it off in my life those feelings
2271026 i never thought id be talking about my life in such intimate detail with anyone so when i did come out and kind of accepted it and shared it with the world and saw how greatly it was accepted and how a lot of people were relating to the stories id have people come up to me telling me because of what you did i had the courage to come out to my family it was such an encouraging experience i wanted to share my life story with other people to see if it could help others if i hadnt come out i might still be miserable and hiding things
2271027 i know plenty of people in the industry that are in the closet and not wanting to share that personal detail of their life and i understand that its a very scary thing especially when new artists are about to break or actors are taking straight roles youre afraid the audience wont buy it the publisher and a lot of people wanted more dirt in my book because controversy sells to me its not about selling a book i just wanted to share my story without hurting anyones feelings or throwing anyone under the bus theres lots of things i could definitely say and point the finger at people but i wanted this to be a positive book and my life up to now has been very positive im happy with every aspect of my life and i dont want to complain about anything ive ever done
2271028 he attended one of bass house parties and stumbled upon his pal sitting in a closed room with his boyfriend sitting across his lap he walked in and was like oh sorry and walked out and i was going no its ok joey he knew from that moment on that was the day i told him
2271029 i definitely think people will be surprised at a lot of things in the book no one has really seen the true me i think a lot of questions will be answered to a lot of fans because i get a lot of questions every day this is my answer time
2271030 people have said for so long that you cant be successful in this industry and be out and gay and i think thats a bunch of bull its never been tested before but i plan to test it next year i have a show that i am developing which will be a music show based around out gay and bisexual guys who will come together to form a boy band i will be casting it and it should be fun i want to test that theory out and do a cultural experiment to see if it works

2271032 ryan tedder the single is a good summery track that missed the summer mark by a full two months
2271033 if the version were to be date based instead of releasing 2 6 26 maybe we could have 2008 7 instead or just increment the major version every decade the middle version every year and the minor version every time we make a release whatever i could also see the second number as being the year and 2008 would get 2 8 and then next year id make the first release of 2009 be 2 9 1 and probably avoid the 0 just because it again has the connotations of a big new untested release which is not true in a date based numbering scheme and then 2010 would be 3 0 1 etc
2271034 i have to say that i personally dont have any hugely strong opinions on the numbering
2271035 the only thing i do know is that i agree that big meaningless numbers are bad 26 is already pretty big as you point out the 2 4 x series has much bigger numbers yet
2271036 2 weeks of merge window until rc1 followed by roughly two months of stabilization

2271039 yes that kernel back there has been a really good one
2271040 seriously because some people are talking about adopting a more sane version numbering scheme
2271041 i sure hope you arent providing support for someones business or anything important like that
2271042 feel free to move to the bsd camp they produce great os es as well but if you want to announce it like this you need to come up with a much better reason
2271043 ok so youve waited 4 years are you making your decisions based on actual utility and actual measurement or based on perception and wishful thinking 4 years is a long time to tread water if any instability you experienced was material wouldnt it have been such an issue you would have switched by now
2271044 id rather run a more guaranteed os on my servers
2271045 and besides are you running a linus kernel or a vendor kernel linus is the development branch the big mental shift in the development methodology was to eliminate the schizophrenia and not make the development branch do double duty as the release branch for extended periods of time distros now own the release branches
2271046 it was never officially established as anything one user that had contributed to the kernel decided to backport fixes from the linus kernel to 2 6 16 using the same guidelines as the stable team http kerneltrap org node 6930 and since the kernel is gpl and you can do pretty much whatever you want with it withing the gpl limits the stable team said fine good luck to you
2271047 before jumping ship please try the ubuntu lts sever for instance its stable frozen whatever until 2013 so you wont have any new features only backported fixes until then
2271048 big meaningless numbers are bad 26 is already pretty big

2271054 with this kind of computing power future generations will have the ability to collaborate and communicate in ways older people like me cannot even imagine
2271055 we need so much processing power there would even be an issue about getting enough electricity to run the computers if they were all at cern the only answer was a new network powerful enough to send the data instantly to research centres in other countries
2271056 it will lead to whats known as cloud computing where people keep all their information online and access it from anywhere
2271057 projects like the grid will bring huge changes in business and society as well as science
2271058 holographic video conferencing is not that far away online gaming could evolve to include many thousands of people and social networking could become the main way we communicate

2271063 executive privilege claims that form the foundation of the executives resistance to the committees subpoenas are not foreign to federal courts either
2271064 in the thirty four years since united states v nixon was decided the courts have routinely considered questions of executive privilege or immunity
2271065 is not merely an investigation into the executives use of his removal power but rather a broader inquiry into whether improper partisan considerations have influenced prosecutorial discretion
2271066 defies both reason and precedent to say as the executive does that the committee which is charged with oversight of doj generally cannot permissibly employ its investigative resources on this subject
2271067 unique ability to address improper partisan influence in the prosecutorial process n o other institution will fill the vacuum if congress is unable to investigate and respond to this evil
2271068 the 110th congress expires on january 3 2009 unlike the senate the house is not a continuing body
2271069 on the committees side the entire house and thus any outstanding subpoenas will lapse on january 3 2009 and the basis of this lawsuit will cease to exist to be sure the incoming house of representatives may elect to re issue similar subpoenas but that remains speculative at this juncture similarly the incoming executive administration may decline to pursue the assertions of immunity and executive privilege that form the foundation of this dispute
2271070 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
2271071 as with the incoming congress there is no way to predict whether the new administration will support the assertions of privilege made in this case there is also the likelihood of appeal of this decision and given the significance of the issues involved a stay pending appeal is at least possible thus although proceedings before this court could be concluded prior to january 2009 any appeals process may not run its course before that date at that point the case would arguably become moot nevertheless the court concludes that this concern does not counsel against entertaining this case
2271072 lets get all this behind us so that the congress will not be fooling around with bush once the new president arrives

2271088 as a leader in promoting the conservation of tigers the united states has a responsibility to effectively manage its captive tiger population to prevent any emergence of illegal trade
2271089 any supply of tiger parts into the black market can stimulate trade and consumer demand which could pose a serious threat to already dwindling wild tiger populations
2271090 the u s federal and state governments have an opportunity to address this vulnerability now to prevent potential abuse and demonstrate their strong conservation leadership we must take all steps necessary to protect tigers to ensure their survival into the future

2271097 beijings major pollutants nitrogen oxides sulphur dioxide suspended particulate matter dust less than ten micrometres diameter ozone and carbon monoxide come from vehicle exhaust factories and construction sites and volatile organic compounds vocs mainly come from gas stations
2271098 vehicle emissions contribute 60 to 70 per cent of air pollution in beijing and these pollutants usually stay in the air for three to four days
2271099 if air pollution is to reach an alarming level often triggered by extreme weather conditions such as high temperatures high humidity and no wind emergency plans will start including pulling more cars off road or shutting down more factories
2271100 about 70 per cent of the devices used in the monitoring network were developed domestically including the equipment that measures pollutants such as nitric oxide carbon monoxide methane ammonia and vocs
2271101 we do not lack talents or technology but policy support
2271102 when the chinese undertake this enormous change in their emissions it will send a signal to the united states that the control of air pollution in one part of the world can in fact affect the atmosphere on the other side of the globe
2271103 the scientific community should plan immediately to take advantage of this monumental experiment mobilising to measure the effect by studying pollution levels before during and after the great shutdown

2271110 there is no proof that commercial preparations such as tablets dentifrices mouthwashes or chewing gum containing fluorides are effective in preventing dental decay unfortunately such preparations are being offered to the public without adequate scientific evidence of their value
2271111 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
2271112 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk
2271113 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations
2271114 in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
2271115 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
2271116 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit

2271295 these developments are good news perhaps the repeated calls to these democracies to behave in an exemplary manner has finally borne fruit but we must remain careful and vigilant nothing can be taken for granted and we hope this trend will continue or even accentuate near year we regret all the same that only two g8 members canada 18th and germany 20th managed to be among the top 20

2271424 ebony ivory live together in perfect harmony side by side on my piano keyboard oh lord why dont we
2271425 cause youre all whores and im a fag and ive got no mother and ive got no dad to save me the wasted save me from myself i lie just to be real and id die just to feel
2271426 i like the places where the night does not mean an end where smiles break free and surprise is your friend and dancing goes on in the kitchen until dawn
2271427 keep your loved ones near and let them know just where youll be because others need you right nearby just as you need me
2271428 i went outside and i stood very still in the night and i looked at the sky and knew someday id die and then everything would be alright
2271429 i wouldnt trade my life for someones millions and i know you left for a reason
2271430 chicks taste in music sucks girly doesnt know the difference between tom waits and tom hanks she thinks mission of burma was a 1950s russian space expedition and that radiohead stole their ideas from coldplay for chrissakes
2271431 right now curtiss and i are not aligned in terms of the music that will be utilized vis a vis our musical preferences however im confident we can reach a mutual agreement without me having to withhold certain favors from him
2271432 i picked upbeat fun danceable music and i expected curtiss to do the same
2271433 i came up with enough 1990s sugar pop tunes to keep everyone dancing like the funky bunch and of course the macarena no reception is complete without that one
2271434 no i was horrified and emotionally disturbed the mixture of depressing atonal and patently unlistenable squawking crap he came up with i cant even give a name its a wedding not some emo weep fest
2271435 a wedding is more than just a celebration of life eternal love new beginnings and all that crap
2271436 its also the perfect opportunity to foist my musical preferences on unsuspecting relatives
2271437 i want my wedding to have a certain vibe to it sure its flowers and roses and obnoxiously drunken distant uncles but its about more than that if i convert just one person to a love of my bloody valentine or jawbox while ruining the experience for everyone else it will be totally worth it
2271438 five years is barely enough time to plan a vacation let alone a wedding
2271439 a man of 34 years was to the police station of london in this morning with marked hour and imprisoned had to a aggression accusation it is under safekeeping now
2271440 when do you like to listen to your favorite music
2271441 it will make you rosy it will make you a rosy bride
2271442 by taking you for a walk ill be giving him a rosy bride
2271443 i had to find out what your silver pattern is
2271444 i plan to give you and your husband a spoon
2271445 oh newt youre fooling me about being a w o l
2271446 one foot in front of the other through leaves over bridges
2271447 what a crazy time to tell me you love me
2271448 so far no farther i shouldnt have come out with you at all
2271449 if somebody walked in and heard you talking to me that way a week before the wedding
2271450 let me say that im deeply honored by this crazy thing youve done
2271451 and im very fond of you as a friend newt extremely fond but its just too late
2271452 i dont mean you should do it now i just mean that this is all so unexpected i havent got the remotest idea of how to respond
2271453 i wasnt counting on it this is very nice just walking
2271454 remember me from time to time remember how much i loved you
2271455 that was sweet we should have kissed weve been so close ill always remember you newt and good luck
2271456 but i didnt ask you to go a w o l
2271457 you certainly dont deserve any heros reward for doing something as foolish as that
2271458 do you have any idea how offensive youre being many many many things are good about henry yes
2271459 and many many many things are probably bad too but that isnt any of your business i love henry and i dont have to argue his merits with you
2271460 one foot in front of the other through leaves over bridges
2271461 scientists will say it cant be done and yet they are the same people to tell you to think outside the box
2271462 we found an interest in guitars and motorcycle riding i got to talking to him about the things he is working on for about 10 years
2271463 he taught me what he knew about it and we have been collaborating on it ever since
2271464 yes you have to have some knowledge and have to have some schooling but i think its the tinkering and stumbling on to things that get it done
2271465 it can be done because it doesnt break any laws right of the bat the skeptics are going to say you cant get something for nothing but youre not you are using one to create another to create the other and back and forth
2271466 the time is now to do something about our environment while we still can
2271467 we need a clean source of energy and this is certainly a way of going about it
2271468 well whats wrong with being drunk its what were after isnt it lets not kid each other papa not tonight we know what were trying to forget but lets not talk about it its no use now
2271469 too busy not breaking me to take the wrecking ball to each other
2271470 hey see here its my blog and i rant here you have a problem with that wait till you see this how much is a big bag of ice about 5kgs of ice rm3 guess how much is a few cups of ice for my case rm 43 50 i can have enough ice to keep a penguin alive for at least a week in africa
2271471 even if we have it well written on our face
2271472 a worldwide community of photographers provided valuable insight and feedback as part of the lightroom 2 public beta program ultimately helping us deliver a better product
2271473 weve considered their requests which helped us develop useful features that make it easier than ever for our customers to quickly refine enhance and present brilliant photographs
2271474 one of the big reasons why lightroom has become such a phenomenon among serious photographers is that adobe built it with the input of a very vocal user community
2271475 adobe really listens to the issues and challenges todays photographers face and theyve built a complete solution that not only meets the needs of photographers it really feels like it was made just for us the enhancements to lightroom 2 combined with the power of photoshop give photographers the ultimate freedom to produce professional images quickly
2271476 times when people were probably holding their breath about it
2271477 he who knows only his own country is like a man who reads but the first chapter of a book
2271478 this land is their land reports from a divided nation
2271479 shes been with me through thick and thin shes been the reason im here im proud of myself for not breaking down completely
2271480 it gives you a mental workout and delusions of grandeur thats what harry caray did to me
2271481 the reality is that since rays buyout there hasnt been a lot of interest
2271482 everyone agrees we could make a war very easily but with no winner
2271483 the model tells us where eelgrass could potentially grow based on limited information
2271484 there really hasnt been a lot of research done on eelgrass in the estuary where is it growing and where isnt it growing and why
2271485 the hypothesis is well find higher abundance of crab around eelgrass than on bare sediment
2271486 typically in estuaries around the world there was more than there is now
2271487 if we put the plants in and they do well it will show the plants can live here and we can do more and expand the area
2271488 we suspect that the conditions for eelgrass have improved since installation of the dams because the salt wedge is able to intrude farther into the estuary during the summer than would normally occur
2271489 even though we dont see it everywhere now the chemistry and water quality issues that make life suitable for eelgrass are better now
2271490 this would help offset some of those losses even if its not exactly the same habitat it provides sheltered habitat and eating areas
2271491 again hes given us all a peek at what hes capable of
2271492 there is so much more in there and you can see it but its only come in flashes so far some of that may be due to the aggressive nature in which the mariners have chosen to push him which means you throw the statistics out the window
2271493 hes still the youngest everyday player in advanced a and he has certainly improved only you cant see it in the numbers
2271494 i still think theres 20 25 homers in that bat and hes easily the most impressive talent i have seen from seattles farm system since felix hernandez came through at some point over the next 600 or 700 at bats that kid is probably going to pop and when he does it will be fun at least for the mariners
2271495 hes not going to play short but third makes sense and he proved he could hit most at bats he was in charge even without a lot of patience he was controlling the strike zone for the most part he did swing at some balls out of the zone but he also got some hits that way
2271496 hes not going to be in the minor leagues in three years
2271497 i cant really see how he isnt up by then
2271498 the more i realized no so much more happened and instead of being this inspiring tableau of cooperation there was a much more complex interesting and important story when it came to relating to what america would become
2271499 for example one of the things i had been taught was that the pilgrims sailed to the new world in search of religious freedom and what you quickly come to realize was that the pilgrims did not believe in religious freedom they believed their religion was the right religion and did not mean to tolerate others who wanted a different religion these were not prototypical patriots these were separates puritans and their beliefs were everything
2271500 there were very few trees very low and sandy land they saw no evidence of any people in the three years when they were preparing to sail across the atlantic the native americans in southern new england were hit by a series of devastating plagues and in some cases it killed 90 percent of the native americans when the pilgrims got there it was empty with only the whitened bones of the dead along the shoreline and it was here the pilgrims planned to start a new life
2271501 and for the english it was an essential ally without massasoits advice they never would have lasted the first winter or very long into the decade so for 55 years there would be peace in plymouth colony and thats unprecedented when you look at the subsequent history of not only new england but america
2271502 and it was not so much an english celebration although it may have been their idea but a native celebration the pilgrims were outnumbered two to one by the indians who showed up in great numbers with five deer to add to the feast and this is amazing when you think about the year all of them had been through
2271503 and soon all of new england was up in flames half the towns in the region would be burned or abandoned this conflict was only fourteen months but it had a devastating impact on the region more than 5 000 people were killed when the population of new england was only 70 000 making it even bloodier than the civil war which most of us look to as the bloodiest conflict on american soil the english were supposedly triumphant but it wasnt a triumph at all by pushing the indians too hard they had destroyed their forefathers way of life
2271504 they didnt necessarily understand each other or like each other that much but to maintain peace they had to negotiate the second generation became a little complacent a little greedy and lost sight of this lesson and this is where the story of the mayflower and the pilgrims does have something to teach us it is possible for two very different peoples to make it work it just takes a lot of effort
2271505 i am so glad little evan turned out sooo cute
2271506 i hope youre prepared to carry your dog on those stairs
2271507 you wish instead of judges of the peace to institute zemsky nachalniks with birch rods that is your business but we will not go to law before your zemsky nachalniks and will not ourselves accept appointment to such an office you wish to make trial by jury a mere formality that is your business but we will not serve as judges or as advocates or jurymen you wish under the name of a state of siege to establish despotism that is your business but we will not participate in it and will plainly call the state of siege despotism and capital punishment inflicted without trial murder you wish to organize cadet corps or classical high schools in which military exercises and the orthodox faith are taught that is your affair but we will not teach in such schools or send our children to them but will educate our children as seems to us right you decide to reduce the local government boards zemstvos to impotence we willnot take part in it you prohibit the publication of literature that displeases you you may seize books and punish the printers but you cannot prevent our speaking and writing and we shall continue to do so you demand an oath of allegiance to the tsar we will not accede to what is so stupid false and degrading you order us to serve in the army we will not do so because wholesale murder is as opposed to our conscience as individual murder and above all because the promise to murder whomsoever a commander may tell us to murder is the meanest act a man can commit you profess a religion which is a thousand years behind the times with an iberian mother of god xv relics and coronations that is your affair but we do not acknowledge idolatry and superstition to be religion but call them idolatry and superstition and we try to free people from them
2271508 but why papa did you say so and so and now you do and say something quite different
2271509 ok take this stuff away so my insurance will be effective
2271510 the only real practical measure for the goodness and mercy of god to me is the extent to which i am in turn prepared to show goodness and mercy to others it is this lack of love among christians which today makes the church an insipid lukewarm institution but men and women who know firsthand about the goodness and mercy of god in their own lives will be warm and affectionate with goodness and mercy to others this is to be a benefit to them but equally important it is to be a blessing to god nothing pleased me more than to see my flock flourish and prosper it was a reward for my efforts and energy most of us forget that our shepherd is looking for some satisfaction as well
2271511 is not that you need to find your way through the jungle of language and problems that today surround god but that god loves you is present in you lives in you dwells in you calls you saves you and offers you an understanding and light which are like nothing you ever found in books or heard in sermons
2271512 by katherine ashenburg which looks at the history of cleanliness from antiquity to the 21st century an eye opener to say the least i highly recommend it puts a whole new spin on our obsession with cleanliness and sanitization
2271513 well everyone passes except jazz because she cant even tread water for a whole minute
2271514 its the grand launch she hasnt even revealed the name of the perfume yet
2271515 we pride ourselves on being one of britains trendiest stores but were obviously not posh enough for posh
2271516 that is simply because the whole theme of her new fragrance is purple
2271517 will believe it is talking to moss but it is actually alfresco
2271518 were not coming out with this to say replace sharepoint because i think thats a dry futile argument
2271519 alfresco does charge for support and it has very large deals theres a potential for savings but it would depend on the specifics
2271520 one of the things you always hear about sharepoint is that microsoft gives it away thats not true and neither is the idea that open source is free
2271521 quickly shifted their marketing from being an open source alternative to documentum to being an open source alternative to sharepoint
2271522 sharepoint is really the disrupter in the content management market now presenting itself as an alternative to that is a good story to tell
2271523 theyre smart to not position it as a rip and replace because so many people are early on in their sharepoint implementations

2271532 generating cheap controversy with this type of ad is the kind of tactic some companies resort to in an attempt to get more for their advertising spend

2271536 the international wine and spirit competition is the premier competition of its kind in the world its aim is to promote the quality and excellence of the worlds best wines spirits and liqueurs
2271537 all our wines spirits and liqueurs are blind tasted in groups divided by variety region and vintage as necessary awards are made on a points system and sponsored trophies are presented in selected categories technical analysis is carried out on gold gold best in class silver best in class award winning wines spirits and liqueurs to ensure that all products are technically sound and will be of the same high quality when they reach the consumer as they were when our judging panels originally tasted them
2271538 this award will come as a real shock to the centuries old whisky industry which is not noted for its keen appreciation of supermarket varieties
2271539 to beat world renowned whiskies such as laphroaig and glenmorangie is some achievement and will hopefully help encourage all malt lovers to try it
2271540 use fresh mint use rosemary use anything thyme for example is wonderful with most things quickly mash let the oil come through or you can put it with crushed ice and that acts like an abrasive rub it in then when you take it out the ice smells of the herb add bourbon rye rum whatever sweetener you have a bit of apricot liquor some maraschino just two drops will do keep it simple see what happens let it work its magic be gentle with it
2271541 at glenglassaugh we believe that we have a unique opportunity to breathe life back into a hidden gem the swa is of vital importance to the whisky industry and we recognise the part they play in ensuring that brands like ours become part of scotlands future whisky heritage
2271542 i think that i will take 2 small bottles of dubonnet and gin with me this morning in case it is needed it is a beautiful day could we have lunch under the tree one could have 14 at the table and four at a small table

2271549 cubans lawyers did a good job of painting lips on a pig
2271550 i breached the consulting contract by withholding 25 thousand dollars rather than immediately informing nellie that he was in breach as a result i breached first and owe him and am happy to pay it
2271551 the good news is that from nellies testimony under oath i got to find out the truth of what happened prior to nellie taking the warriors job and it certainly was not what was said publicly
2271552 it was not something that happened quickly as was quoted in the press nellie and chris mullin were meeting and having discussions about the warriors draft while he was under contract to the mavs and we were playing in the finals
2271553 it was a very emotional moment for me after we won the deciding game against puerto rico
2271554 we had a chance to take a close look at some of these guys and the experience was positive
2271555 an 11 game summer league schedule is not easy its a lot of games crammed into a short period of time everyones concentration was good and we went 7 4
2271556 anything is possible there can be no activity there can be a huge trade or there can be a minor trade there are a host of possibilities but right now its quiet
2271557 ill be watching it very closely just because i have a rooting interest for both guys
2271558 im viewing the olympic experience as very positive for our team because i think that kind of experience will help your growth as a player
2271559 the olympics will be of great interest to all mavs fans because of these two guys and their two great stories
2271560 jason kidd is the elder statesman and captain of the u s team and dirk is the captain and inspirational leader of germanys team its a huge deal
2271561 its a great honor and im very excited for the opening ceremony on friday
2271562 it has always been our dream to participate at the olympic games and now we finally made it
2271563 one of the reasons was probably that we changed his position we put him at the power forward instead of the small forward and he did a very good job there
2271564 the game is becoming more sized down and more quickness oriented
2271565 he got more done as a power forward there are situations now with the way the game is played where quickness trumps size his effectiveness at the power forward position as opposed to small forward is evidence of that
2271566 we see rhodes as an athletic tenacious 4 5 type that can shoot the mid range shot and is a very good rebounder

2271571 given the nature of irans rulers and the trouble it is causing in the middle east the us and other nations could not stand by as a terror supporting state fulfils its most aggressive ambitions the iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences the united states joins other nations in sending a clear message we will not allow iran to have a nuclear weapon
2271572 the security council has twice imposed sanctions on iran and called on the regime to cease enriching uranium the iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences yet the regime continues to do so and continues to practice delay and deception in an obvious attempt to buy time
2271573 the games popularity is explained by the fact that anyone can do it as opposed to crossword puzzles which assume a certain vocabulary and some cultural knowledge sudoku cuts across all that and allows young and old alike to play it

2271578 there really have been so many amazing moments we can look to
2271579 we still have notebooks full of letters that are amazing from soldiers prisoners missionaries and people all over the world but one cool thing that happened while making this record was when came to sing she was singing and at the very end of the song run to you vocalist
2271580 afterward we went up just to say that was amazing and you could just tell that it was a real emotional kind of thing
2271581 its one of those things where were thinking that its cool that a singer from a cool band is singing on our record and for her she had a connection with our music from early on youd never know it you listen to flyleaf and third day is the last thing youre thinking about
2271582 but to have the grammys before the record and then this right in the middle of recording that was further confirmation that theres a lot of people that care about what we do its always worth giving our all
2271583 what was funny with this record is that we got everything we could have wanted
2271584 weve learned that the limitations that people feel for christian music are self imposed we can prevent our own progression if we could just be bold enough to go for what we really want we might actually get it weve learned this over the years we wanted
2271585 so weve learned that we have to stop apologizing for who we are and what we do
2271586 its not something that you necessarily do by yourself in a basement with hand cream
2271587 we felt for a host of reasons it was important to bring the parties together and make it clear to both organizations that public comments disparaging the other were bad for the business and would no longer be tolerated
2271588 he won a stanley cup great ive won six stanley cups you want to count rings who cares its just a little pathetic that he carries on
2271589 this blog provides experts in the industry with a place to learn and voice what is happening with the staffing in the legal technology market
2271590 it gives a voice to the issues that this industry is facing there is much growth happening and it is important for the law firms and corporations to have a solid understanding of the talent that is needed to bring them to the next level i am hoping this forum provides this for both hiring managers and job seekers

2271598 for every athlete it is like a dream to participate in the olympic games especially for us because basketball in iran is not that important
2271599 everyone is looking for you and taking care of you
2271600 in my opinion thats only way to improve these players because iranian league is not so strong they dont have enough tough games
2271601 genetically they have good abilities they have good body skills but they do not have enough good technical games in iranian league
2271602 how something as simple as a game of basketball can promote understanding
2271603 in an increasingly turbulent world it is rewarding to bring people together to celebrate teamwork discipline and respectful competition on the court
2271604 if you participate in olympic games after 40 years you can say i was in olympic games i was in beijing

2271608 i had first game jitters i was kind of shaking out there it hasnt necessarily set in that im an nba player
2271609 i had like four fouls in the first two minutes but i adjusted started moving my feet on defense getting out to the pick and roll earlier and sealing the baseline and started being more aggressive and looking for my shot its a learning curve and i just have to adjust
2271610 hes going to learn a lot of stuff this week
2271611 hell learn the refs and adjust to the pace of the game but hes got a lot of talent and hes going to be better with better players around him
2271612 its a lot faster a lot more up and down
2271613 but i never gave up hope i knew i could play i just needed to be more mature on the floor
2271614 i loved my time in boston im happy for the celtics and for their fans
2271615 people tend to look at the highlights and judge me on that
2271616 everyone knows i can dunk but i can do other things i have the ability to shoot the ball and im trying to show the people at the dallas mavericks i can do other things
2271617 but we feel hes a good risk with his age we know he has nba talent
2271618 we think he can be effective from the three point line
2271619 we also think with his length and size he has the tools to be a good defensive player

2271699 past studies have shown that intestinal bacteria change when people lose weight since bacteria interact with what you eat it is logical to think that there is a connection between those microbes and desires for certain foods

2271779 when you look at the recent history of afghanistan there is other than the taliban no force there trying to unify the country or to create a nation out of its patchwork of ethnic communities why did they emerge when they did in the mid 1990s to ask that question we must look very closely at how afghanistan has been dealt this terrible hand by the soviet union the united states and its immediate neighbor pakistan the country consisted of various tribes a subsistence economy agricultural communities and herders a small educated number of people started fantasizing about modernisation of course this being part of the cold war era they had to take sides and they ended up siding with the soviet union there were splits within the communist party in afghanistan eventually the soviet union intervened then they pushed through this very badly conceived oppressive programme of modernisation put all the girls in schools and killed all the muslims who protested so you had a mini genocide which is hardly ever talked about hundreds of thousands of afghans were killed during that first process of soviet led modernisation then of course you had resentment within these traditional tribal communities and they threw up their own commanders and mujahadeen leaders the americans in their wisdom decided to support these groups the more radical ones among them at that time radical islam was not a threat it was actually an ally against the soviet union and then the saudis joined in and they had their own agenda they wanted to be the leaders of the islamic world and they were feeling insecure after khomeini had come to power in iran they wanted to run down iran so there was a confluence of interests in this thus far neglected part of the world and what it ended up creating was a massive amazing mess that the taliban was left to sort out there was a need for the taliban in afghanistan at that particular moment this has always been something we forget when we talk about anachronistic medieval eruptions afghans felt that theyd gone too far down the road of chaos mayhem and random violence and that they needed to restore some order back into the country and thats why the taliban emerged became rapidly popular and cut across ethnic loyalties of course there was real oppression under the taliban so there was a degree of popular support when the americans first bombed them forces like the taliban are products of certain political processes set in motion by the west processes that create chaos and poverty instead of development growth and progress processes of the cold war you had a pre modern community of tribal societies and then you had some of the most modern weapons technology available first through the soviet union and then through the americans i think perhaps the fact that these worlds are so fundamentally incompatible at one level that when they clash as they did in afghanistan they could only have produced a 9 11 the fact that afghanistan did not have a significant intellectual class meant that there were no mediators in the encounter between this pre modern world and this very aggressive modern world it was just a head on collision which then produced this radical islamist ideology before this people didnt really have ideologies people were loyal to their tribe and their regional communities but they didnt have these kinds of overarching ideologies that were introduced into afghanistan by the saudis working with the pakistanis so the way in which ideologies also became globalized during this period and assumed these political forms has something to do with it i think radical islam assumed its most political form in afghanistan during the mid 1990s which then attracted people like bin laden to it it then became this very powerful ideology

2271839 any time a third or more of the vulnerabilities in a given year are attributed to a single language you know you have a problem
2271840 the reasons for this are many but the most important one is that i have realised that any attempt to improve the security of php from the inside is futile
2271841 the php group will jump into your boat as soon you try to blame phps security problems on the user but the moment you criticise the security of php itself you become persona non grata
2271842 i do not believe the main reason for his disengagement has to do with the way we deal with security issues but the way he interacted with other people on the team
2271843 we have shown in the past that we are willing to change defaults and sometimes to remove features just to make it more difficult for developers to make security mistakes
2271844 i think it is tough for the general public to write secure dynamic web applications
2271845 as much as possible scripting languages for web sites should be dummy proof in many incidences i a security professional wondered how to code some bit securely i wanted to but how to do it was not immediately obvious
2271846 to say php has a security problem suggests that its impossible to develop a secure php application but to say php doesnt have a security problem suggests that everything is perfect neither is true
2271847 web application security is a rapidly evolving discipline and its difficult for the average developer to keep up with the pace

2271854 the result of this project is an increased performance of the arcgis servers soap stack by about 90
2271855 as we expand our focus from a dedicated game phone to a gaming service we are making getting and playing games even easier
2271856 the n gage service combined with powerful devices world class titles and brands and interactive social networking features takes the mobile gaming experience beyond traditional boundaries
2271857 with the new n gage experience fans of some of our most popular franchises like fifa or the sims can play and stay connected with other fans with millions of compatible nokia devices already in the marketplace were very excited to help bring quality mobile gaming expriences to the fingertips of a global audience
2271858 the super star students show that rocked the school months ago is now back
2271859 the power to control the flow of information is the power to control the way people think
2271860 sometime during the next decade we may all think alike and act alike and not even know that we had a choice
2271861 oh no dont kill any creature never destroy a church or harm any preacher women babies and old take care plants amp roses you dont dare
2271862 is there one more thing i can do for bees just one small thing
2271863 the norths food inventory has almost hit the bottom so unless theres an extraordinary measure to stabilise supply there may be a situation next year similar to the late 1990s
2271864 chronic malnutrition among north korean children remains a problem but mass hunger has not set in food and malnutrition is an issue but to say that people are starving we do not have evidence of that i wouldnt qualify it as famine i think the situation in the late 1990s and the situation now is very different
2271865 in many locations the prt program in iraq is making incremental progress in developing the nations provincial and local government capacity to effectively govern and manage its own reconstruction despite continuing violence and strife however iraqs complex and overlapping sectarian political and ethnic conflicts as well as the difficult security situation continue to hinder progress in promoting economic development the rule of law and political reconciliation despite the best efforts of prt civilian and military officials who are working under dangerous and austere conditions to accelerate the iraqi transition to self reliance resolving these problems will likely be a slow process it will require years of steady engagement and will depend heavily on the security environment and political settlements at the national level
2271866 if the story of iraq reconstruction tells anything teaches any lesson it is that the u s government was not well structured and was not well poised in 2003 to engage in the kind of post conflict relief and reconstruction operations we have faced
2271867 numerous prt officials identified rule of law as the most problematic
2271868 measuring the prts it would seem to me is an art not a science
2271869 is unclear as these countries will be in a perpetual state of improving governance and increasing economic development
2271870 intercepted a weapons convoy on september 5 in the western part of this country this weapons convoy clearly geographically originated from iran this convoy contained a number of advanced technology improvised explosive devices it is difficult for me to conceive that this convoy could have originated in iran and come to afghanistan without at least the knowledge of the iranian military
2271871 this time several weeks ago last year there was much fear and anxiety about the imminent collapse of kandah r province thats not the case this year kandahar is a lot more secure a province than it was last year we have worked very hard in the dimension of enabling governance and we probably have not had as much success in helping the afghan people as any of us would have liked we are simply buying space and time for the development of the afghan security forces
2271872 one group of taliban say they want to come back in and be part of a process but here are the conditions another one is saying there are no conditions and were not going to talk who is the taliban in this case i see it as a splintered and fractured organization that only exists under a general framework if you negotiate with extremists or insurgents you should do so from a position of strength
2271873 i dont feel that kind of passion to do a role and be great coming from those guys because if it was there they would do it i mean theyre all in a position to do it pacino always wanted to do theater he wanted to do pacino will say oh i was raised next to a furnace in new york and im never going to l a but they all live off the fat of the land
2271874 i think if there was a role that de niro was hungry for he would come after it i dont think jack would jack has money and influence and girls and i think hes a little bit like except brando went through some tough times
2271875 hes got a little bit of a mean streak hes intelligent always wired in with the big guys and the big bosses of the studios
2271876 the song bounces along lightly as vocals bubble out like cotton candy around the repetitive lines that have already gotten stuck in my head
2271877 this is a part of our campaign to help consumers fight unprecedented inflation
2271878 when i bought rice stocks three months ago regular basmati was at 32 rs a kg now it is 38
2271879 ill go to the wholesale market again on sunday and see if prices are increasing again
2271880 prices dropping at kirana stores could be because of various reasons such as adulteration or pds supplies being diverted into the market
2271881 but the rise is not hurting the middle class that badly thanks to growing incomes but savings are getting affected
2271882 i have asked somebody to find out whether it was a promotional offer from airtel or an unsolicited message
2271883 when we get requests from customers for premium numbers they are processed accordingly in different circles but we do not offer this as a service
2271884 there is a procedure you have to apply for the number and only then we can comment
2271885 there is nothing in the license agreement of the telcos that prohibits this
2271886 the only intense personal relationship she seems to have had is with her mentor kanshi ram the exact contours of this often tempestuous and clearly obsessive relationship remain a mystery although there are enough people who had the opportunity to observe them at close quarters who suggest that the close personal bond between the two was multi dimensional
2271887 this is irrelevant except for salacious tittle tattle considering what they shared was much more sweeping and had far wider implications than a mere affair it was the political association between the two that acquired such huge significance
2271888 and yet it is in up where the bsp has been successful in kanshi rams home state punjab the bsps support has actually eroded
2271889 it is amazing that in 30 years of politics mayawati has never been to jail the bsp is a mass mobiliser but does not believe in agitational politics it has no middle or second rung of leaders
2271890 i have noted with some bemusement that those who are now lauding mayawati to the skies after the bsps stupendous victory in 2007 up assembly polls earlier dismissed her as a crude corrupt and unscrupulous politician
2271891 the next general elections need to usher in a period of considerable instability if mayawati is to have a crack at the top job
2271892 we all underestimated mayawati always but by taking the bsp from strength to strength even after kanshi rams stroke in 2003 and death in 2006 mayawati has proved us all wrong
2271893 her two volume autobiography was a big goldmine of information and plodding through the voluminous hindi tomes was worth the exercise
2271894 we have not prepared any such report and dont know what these media reports are alluding to
2271895 i have myself made a presentation before amnesty international in 1993 about 450 killings and asiawatch ngo has recorded 1 200
2271896 that it took them 18 years to even make such a report speaks of their callousness
2271897 it shows they never wanted to do it in the first place as they want to hide the truth about the ethnic cleansing and islamic communalism
2271898 it is part of an effort to hoodwink the nation and the world
2271899 many killings were not even recorded instead of investigating them they are busy reducing the figure
2271900 even if one goes by a laymans account of pandits killed in jammu and kashmir since 1989 the number would be higher than 1000 but it isnt about mere numbers
2271901 even if one pandit was killed it is bad enough it is not about numbers
2271902 but some groups want to exaggerate the numbers and then compare it with the holocaust that does not make sense
2271903 if a kashmiri pandit politician or intelligence agent was killed he is not killed because he was a pandit
2271904 and many are listed as unknown if you dont know their identity how do you know they were pandits
2271905 a lot of people in the majority community muslims who have sympathy for the plight of the pandits are discomfited when pandits get national media attention but not the killing of innocent muslims the recent discovery of a mass anonymous grave of over 900 muslims has been largely ignored by the delhi media
2271906 there are no charges against me and i have nothing to say
2271907 when militancy was at its peak in the valley nobody would dare to come out and be a wwitness militants would often be masked and kill in the night you couldnt identify them
2271908 conviction rates are low even for killings of muslims as well we cant see violence against pandits in isolation and why forget the sikhs of chattisinghpora or the hindus of jammu who have been killed
2271909 o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
2271910 shit she peed the damn bed oh thats just amp great
2271911 do those casts come in colors cuz if i could get a red one that would be sweet
2271912 next on the totally useless advice for your life show how to fight lovingly by dr smartypants
2271913 honey i really feel hurt that you forgot that i need you to watch the kids tonight
2271914 oh im sorry dear i didnt realize that i had committed to watching the kids tonight i am working late so i will not be able to
2271915 i would appreciate it if we could keep each other abreast of plans and devise some sort of joint calendar in the future that way i can feel like my plans are just as important and you will always be in the know
2271916 okay ill find a sitter and see you when you get home
2271917 ummm hello what do you mean you are working late tonight you promised to watch the kids
2271918 yeah but i forgot and i have a job that job pays our bills
2271919 oh so my appointments arent as important as your job because you pay the bills
2271920 dont tell me what to do maybe you should keep your promises and then i wont have to get so angry
2271921 maybe you should actually remind me of your 500 appointments so i can keep my promises
2271922 if it was poker night you would sure as hell remember
2271923 im only human why cant we make some kind of joint calendar that keeps track of this stuff so this doesnt happen
2271924 okay that sounds good im sorry i yelled and called you a butt hole
2271925 if your e mail is about aberystwyth hamptons pakistani authors tour istanbul pondicherry dubai and petra festivals i will get back to you in a few days time
2271926 britain is vibrant and daring india is confusing and complicated
2271927 even sending an e mail can be a problem sometimes besides i dont really know india
2271928 i met so many people from different countries it changed my outlook i found kolkata and india limiting
2271929 i dont understand why people need labels ive slept with guys and ive slept with girls
2271930 i was just somebodys partner even if i were the cook i would have felt i was doing something
2271931 i fell in love with morocco its exotic and exciting it has what india doesnt
2271932 i just hope people would have reacted the same way if i were 55
2271933 i am being cheeky when i say that of course its a lot of hard work but in the end that is what i do call people
2271934 not at all its not a hobby im not inviting authors i like i dont let personal choices come in the way of work i do a lot of research and then contact them
2271935 o spirit why did you enter the body of this boy
2271936 when women go on family picnics to india gate they dont realise that the trees in a place like that are at least 200 years old
2271937 evil spirits hang from the branches of old trees and are attracted by perfume
2271938 it comes from the will of allah allahs wish is that you follow him perform namaz regularl y read the quran sharief if your karma is good allah may bless you with ruhaniyat
2271939 ruhaniyat is to be felt ruhaniyat is aatishi ruhaniyat is the power of allah should allah want he can turn day into night and night into day
2271940 i am more like a doctor or engineer you know who uses specialised knowledge
2271941 spritual treatment for the solution of any kind of problem business and marriage purpose effect of bad air jadu tona
2271942 the outward appearance is immaterial ruhaniyat is in the heart and the mind
2271943 irrelevant matters like stomach aches or servants who have run away
2271944 i dont need people or their money they need me
2271945 because they happen of allahs will they happen because man has been running after the shaitaan
2271946 a politician himself once told me that a politician is born after 100 politicians die
2271947 what to do allah takes me all over the world
2271948 and their rss readers would give them all the new stuff from their subscribed blogs it was good
2271949 will you still love me if i have a scar if yes prove it to me with an expensive gift
2271950 yep in all of texas i think i found the only single democrat what are the odds of that
2271951 i want to talk to the head of the hospital
2271952 well can you give me a little information as to the reason for the call so i can know who to send this call too
2271953 i am mad at the treatment of my mother in law
2271954 she is not the patient she is there with her husband my father in law
2271955 oh well can you explain to me what the problem is sir
2271956 yeah we left her there and she is a diabetic and cant go without food
2271957 you understand that the nurses main concern is the patient there may not have been anyone available to go and get your mother in law the food she needed
2271958 the doctor went to the nurses station and told them to get her food and they just wouldnt do it
2271959 sir i can understand your concerns but at this time i will have to bring this to the correct persons attention so your concerns might be addressed quickly
2271960 it is in reference to my mother who was discharge 2 weeks ago with no home health and all her meds changed i know you are in violation of the medicare medicaid rules when no home health was ordered for her
2271961 can you tell me the patients name and spell it for me so i can make sure to have the correct patient
2271962 it doesnt matter what the date of birth is because you dont need to know
2271963 maam i am trying to get your mother pulled up and be able to give my people her information so they can assist you better
2271964 nothing has changed at that hospital i used to work there i know how to get things done who to call i will call legal if i have to what is the name of the top administrator
2271965 well there you go who the hell is she because i sure hadnt heard of her who is the case management director
2271966 dont know who she is either i cant believe this place nothing ever changes
2271967 put me through to the ed director since that is where my mother is at right now and tell me your name and your title and who it is that is over you
2271968 one sip was positive so they set the bar very low
2271969 thats a problem because at least five studies have shown that when a doctor or nurse hands the family that bag even if they take the formula out that mother will have less success with breast feeding
2271970 quantifying self reported chocolate and cocoa consumption is extremely difficult due to considerable variation in the cocoa content of chocolate products
2271971 the darker the chocolate is the better it is the more highly processed the more fat and sweet it is the less it contains theobromine
2271972 in this prospective cohort of pregnant women we observed that chocolate consumption as measured by cord serum levels of the biomarker theobromine was associated with lower risk of preeclampsia
2271973 americas 21st century financial victims make no protest against the federal reserves policy of showering dollars on the people who would seem to need them least

2271977 disposable income is the key to establishing a lucrative business in fashion
2271978 indeed without it most people would not care what the newest styles are or whether a particular designers line of clothing is
2271979 its something thats been happening for a while across west berkshire
2271980 the last traffic warden in wokingham took redundancy and left in july because pcsos have traffic powers now they are undertaking the same work that the traffic wardens did
2271981 being born under this sign determines many talents as well as other characteristics that may not be so commendable rats are very lively and need a lot of mental and physical stimulation they can be calm and perceptive but sometimes their brains can cause a mental restlessness tempting them to take on too much only to discover they are unable to meet their commitments rats are blessed with one of the best intellects going add to their intelligence a curiosity and a bright imagination and they seem as sharp as a needle the sign of the rat is the first sign in the cycle giving rat people exude great leadership qualities and are good at taking the lead they dont mind a lot of responsibility and they demonstrate a strong presence that other people respect for those with the rat nature status and monetary satisfaction are the greatest motivation

2271990 i am an american and alittle worried about reading and writing on your blog
2271991 i am really impressed from the pictures of your country i just hope that syria doesnt get too westernized every nation needs to hold on to some of its past and teach the young its history i do hope that the children hold on to the ways of their country not saying imitating the americans is bad but i am not happy with some of our attitude today i am an older american who i guess is set in his ways and at times do not like what i see of todays world
2271992 i just read a story about you on the net and had a look at your blog i must say its very interesting being from america in the midwest actually i have no idea of what life in syria is like i am a little disturbed by some of the replies of your countrymen but we i understand we have our share of close minded fools also keep up the good work and tell whoever you can that most of us are just ordinary people like them
2271993 we only get a lot of negative news about syria i am glad you are speaking out about the good in your country im not sure that a kentucky fried chicken is great diplomacy but if it works then great im just afraid you folks will blame us for stomach aches
2271994 your blog reads like a boring tourism guide to syria with occasional flashes of brilliance kfc and the supermarket piece
2271995 fatima also said she worries that many americans have a bad impression of syria which is probably true you must understand that we have a large population and many people in the us have never left the country and do not understand other cultures so they are unnecessarily suspicious
2271996 your country has let saddams arsenal be shipped to and hidden in your country the truth will come out eventually and there will be military action in your country the only way to be treated fairly in this world is to renounce violence and corruption and do what you can to promote peace syrian citizens are judged by the actions of their governments because the citizens let the government rule over them i am my own person and would fight to the death to save that right your people need the same passion for freedom and equal rights if you ever want to be considered a respectable people in the eyes of the world
2271997 it was very nice to see syria through the eyes of a person who is detached from the political spin of the world i can tell you that here in the us it is much the same many of our generation are discontent with the government but unfortunately we can do nothing about it if you were to come to the us you would find that there are great people that accept people of all origins like myself i hope you keep your message strong and show the world that we can all have great friends all over the world if we just put aside trivial things perhaps some day i will be able to travel to damascus and see what great things are there but for now my country will not create the favorable conditions for me to do so
2271998 am an older woman i am very curious about womens lives in other cultures do you know any women in your country of 40 60 years who blog but i believe to understand another culture i want to understand the lives of the women i am sure my struggles are the same as theirs i would like to know what they think and why i will also read your blog and learn about the thoughts of a young woman i promise to never intend to insult so perhaps you will have to teach me what is not permissible someday i hope to visit your culture
2271999 i must say that you bring out some very good points of discussion and very good things about your country as did majd and elie hopefully one day sooner than later everyone wouldnt have to worry about things such as terrorism or whos going to attack who or people being killed things of that nature thank you for the insight and ghalia thank you for being who you are youre awesome
2272000 it is good to see women in your part of the world being able to express their thoughts and feelings openly
2272001 congrats on getting your blog featured on yahoo syria is so often discussed as chess piece in the game of mid east politics it is hard to realize it is also a home for people that want kfc dinners and the peaceful pictures of aleppo good luck
2272002 hopefully in the coming years peace can settle in the middle east it will be your generation that will be responsible for making these changes and that is why i encourage you to remain open minded again keep up the good work and do not lose your optimistic attitude it is up to you and your peers to make this world a better place
2272003 ive learned so much about syria in just the 20 minutes i spent looking at your blog today
2272004 it is good to see women in your part of the world being able to express their thoughts and feelings openly
2272005 your people need the same passion for freedom and equal rights if you ever want to be considered a respectable people in the eyes of the world
2272006 if they want a war of religions we are ready
2272007 we are ready to redeem you with our souls and our blood our beloved prophet
2272008 he doesnt have flush draw or a j let him draw to his kicker or fire again and i can check raise
2272009 daddy i just want to stay little forever i dont want to be big
2272010 this evening too from lal ded to abdul ahad zargar
2272011 nothing is worth more than laughter it is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself to be light tragedy is the most ridiculous thing
2272012 what kind of person would feel nothing but coiling snakes of jealousy towards someone as deserving as her
2272013 whoever being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine
2272014 but i see it as ganeshji and what i have got is a chance to put a tilak on ganeshji
2272015 i will tell them they are voting for the brahmin samaj party
2272016 the bjp is no longer a party that works for the benefit of hindus
2272017 actually brahmins were with the bjp because of atal behari vajpayee who is too old now
2272018 you know baniyas have taken over the bjp for 15 years a brahmin niraj chaturvedi was on this seat but he didnt get along with rajnath singh the current bjp president so the bjp brought along a vaish salil vishnoi
2272019 what the bsp think tank has done is to try and treat the brahmins almost like a separate party so that the alliance is viable in the long run
2272020 brahmin shankh bajayega haathi dilli jayega the brahmin will herald the bsps march to delhi
2272021 where there is a brahmin candidate this slogan will be sold to dalits and where there is a dalit candidate this slogan will be sold to brahmins
2272022 my feeling is that satish chandra mishra is also there to take along the states powerful brahmin bureaucracy
2272023 they dont have sc status or obc status we are in the middle mulayam singh has promised us obc status which would get us scholarships and jobs perhaps a road may be built leading up to this slum mayawati opposes obc status for kashyaps why would any of us vote for her
2272024 i dont care if the candidate is brahmin or yadav or muslim it is after all our party
2272025 so that politicians across parties recognise our large numbers and accordingly give us election tickets
2272026 who says the bsp is a party of the dalits behenji mayawati talks of samta moolak samaj a society equal for all were all members of the same family
2272027 brahma is moriya obc by caste and he was too disgusted at the prospect of walking into a basti of doms and musahars
2272028 it is politics and as kanshi ramji said politics is that key that opens all doors
2272029 we voted for the congress for so many years even though it didnt ask for votes along caste lines but they never delivered on development the bsp is our party they just might
2272030 umakant openly said that he was with the bsp only till the next elections and would join the sp thereafter
2272031 smokers the new outcasts growing middleclass intolerance makes smokers feel like pariahs
2272032 nobody really wants smokers in a become the new pariahs
2272033 the caste system of india placed pariahs also known as untouchables very low in society
2272034 india needs to mobilize the entire government and make good on its paper commitments to end caste abuses otherwise it risks pariah status for its homegrown brand of apartheid
2272035 shivam thought this was the smartest thing to do because he was not going to win any peanuts anyway
2272036 there were around 3500 farmers who committed suicides across india
2272037 agricultural deskilling and the spread of genetically modified cotton in warangal
2272038 since 2000 stone has spent some 45 weeks doing field research on warangal farmers cotton seed choice decision making process

2272099 i dont agree with you that most westerners know that those mobs dont represent us is obvious to some extent through the comments i get on this blog
2272100 its all your fault for being so crazy and hard to understand
2272101 america is controlled by jews and thats why you try to kill arabs
2272102 america should just kill those crazies in baghdad and start the country over again
2272103 elsewhere the turkish network ntv television reported that a 16 year old student arrested in connection with the murder of an italian priest on sunday had told interrogators he killed the rev andrea santoro to avenge the publication of the cartoons

2272109 failed writers and half wits populate an overrated world called the blogosphere
2272110 she has a dedicated following but im sure a lot are voyeuristic men seeking titillation i find it a bit superficial myself
2272111 it will be harder to write when youre no longer anonymous
2272112 of course they will censor the net using this bill
2272113 in any case the internet can also be used for broadcasting
2272114 continuously streaming it in digital data form on the computer networks
2272115 it also covers point to point wireless even cb walkie talkie

2272117 gujarat has only regained a high growth rate in the last few years just like the national growth rate
2272118 the gujarati middle class is happy with the path modi is taking gujarat on
2272119 but the picture might be different for farmers and the poor
2272120 however a lot of these claims are related to industry and private sector investments
2272121 the state has found a simple way of showing a decline in poverty figures it has redefined poverty lines for both rural and urban areas so you would be counted as poor in a gujarat town if you earn rs 541 16 a month 0 45 a day or less in a gujarat village the figure is even lower rs 353 93 a month or 30 cents a day most of the other states including the poor ones like jharkhand keep the poverty net wider
2272122 i told him i dont want money but at least try to get me justice
2272123 it was not a biopic and one moves on to other projects
2272124 bhanwari is a very brave woman but it is also the story of so many others beyond a point youre only playing a role
2272125 the ambushing of witnesses of the 1984 anti sikh riots
2272126 if you investigate one case then you have to investigate all others as well
2272127 even muslims did not get justice after 2000 of them were killed in gujarat why are you bothering with an investigation
2272128 humanity was killed during the 2002 riots and unlike the 1984 and 1992 riots the victims of 2002 got justice that generation stood behind the oppressed irrespective of community the victims of godhra and gujarat 2002 got justice a man called narendra modi went to jail
2272129 the gates foundation invests heavily in sub prime lenders and other businesses that undercut its good works
2272130 afzal ko boti boti mein kaat ke kutton ko khila do
2272131 my true occupation at any rate is reading and occasionally writing
2272132 as if deep down there were a prolific intermingling of roots
2272133 we kept looking at each other in silence for the longest time ever
2272134 i shut the door and was never able to open it again
2272135 hide but where each door i close opens up another
2272136 be the change you wish to see in the world
2272137 general awareness for those who cannot access the video on net
2272138 a point or principle on which scattered or opposing groups can come together
2272139 but books written in english within india do tend to address an elite audience
2272140 do the intellectuals actually have a public constituency outside the seminar halls of delhi and mumbai
2272141 is this a group of people who are increasingly becoming known for rent a call mentality
2272142 intellectual passtime while some say its the coming of age of dissent others deny furiously
2272143 i did interrogate and torture him afzal at my camp for several days and we never recorded his arrest in the books anywhere his description of torture at my camp is true that was the procedure those days and we did pour petrol in his ass and gave him electric shocks but i could not break him he did not reveal anything to me despite our hardest possible interrogation we tortured him enough for ghazi baba but he did not break he looked like a bhondu those days what you call a chootiya type and i had a reputation for torture interrogation and breaking suspects if anybody came out of my interrogation clean nobody would ever touch him again he would be considered clean for good by the whole department
2272144 what im really curious about is whether we find ourselves becoming a movement
2272145 the nature of conversations in the blogosphere tends to be insular
2272146 bloggers in a country tend to speak to each other gv adds the context to them and offers them to a global audience
2272147 in arabian blogospheres human rights free speech and democracy are topics of constant discussion
2272148 and since there is strong censorship of the media online self publishing becomes an important outlet
2272149 the cost of a million of these machines is the same as educating 1 38 million kids a year a country which has roughly 40 percent of its kids out of its school system should not be wasting its resources on a fancy gadget of questionable educational value
2272150 a window and a tool a window into the world and a tool with which to think they are a wonderful way for all children to learn through independent interaction and exploration
2272151 dudes three million a year more and for an extra few years how can i pass it up
2272152 we dug ourselves into this hole for 50 years and we will not soon be out of it unless we change our ways
2272153 i used to preach stuff like you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting but people dont want to hear that they need help with their marriage and with raising teen agers
2272154 a bulldog can take a skunk every time but sometimes its just not worth the stink
2272155 we have somehow got hold of the idea that error is only that which is outrageously wrong and we do not seem to understand that the most dangerous person of all is the one who does not emphasize the right things
2272156 more the kind that involves sex and the occasional favor
2272157 sleepiness arising from the opiate may delay successful breast feeding
2272158 darling will you marry me are you interested in the new hdb bto projects
2272159 acog also advises physicians who recruit patients for for profit cord blood banking to disclose their financial interests or other potential conflicts of interest to pregnant women and their families

2272163 the postings on this site are my own and dont necessarily represent ibms positions strategies or opinions
2272164 open source oh i thought you guys were talking about open sores now thats a blog id read daily
2272165 open source is not about freedom nor is it about licenses its about community
2272166 the cat is already out of the bag when it comes to open source related business models and there is no way it is going back in
2272167 is vendor b utilizing the right aspects of the open source business model s to grow the revenue share of open source software within the over 250 billion software market

2272169 tons of work to make vista a fantastic experience when it comes to security

2272171 microsoft has raised its game in a big way on security and windows vista is the next big step the company has learnt to design software which is secure by default
2272172 even if your laptop is stolen nobody will be able to use it because it will be fully encrypted
2272173 youve got to make sure that your firewall is on that youve got anti virus protection on your pc youve got to understand what not to do on the internet

2272176 many motorists simply dont see their two wheeled brethren or when they do find them aggravating
2272177 a motorist and cyclist came to blows after the motorist berated the pedal pusher for ignoring a stop sign
2272178 the enraged cyclist used his bike to batter the motorists car until a bystander punched him
2272179 in los angeles it takes a special kind of road warrior to hop on a bike in the name of saving the planet and a little money
2272180 tensions between cyclists and motorists here have become dangerously combative
2272181 a lot of motorists think cyclists should get off the road

2272183 i have a question everybody can i get your attention
2272184 and during these long very long deliberations mark langes finely tuned mechanism will continue without any great disturbance to distribute its big bucks
2272185 later in the charming motel we are staying in french quarters a staging point much appreciated by clandestine lovers i shall consult other figures the subsidies artificially sustain unprofitable production without them american farmers would stop planting cotton with supply diminishing prices would pick up a rise of between five and seventeen per cent according to the experts
2272186 people open their fridges to others cause every fridge tells a story
2272187 when even english speaking people behave like this i dont see how you could say it comes from any kind of curiosity
2272188 it surely is racism when people refuse to sit next to you in a bus when people you dont know sneer at you and when youre pointed out to kids and called a negro
2272189 but indians are caught in the middle they look up to the whites and look down on the blacks they clearly see themselves as being in between
2272190 a friend wouldnt go to college because of how he was treated he just studied at home and turned up for the exams most africans say they just want to complete their courses and go back home
2272191 just looking a certain way automatically makes you a second class citizen
2272192 there is absolutely no evidence to support this besides would fair skin be a guarantee that a muslim in india would not be discriminated against
2272193 i wont date a girl who is even a shade darker than me
2272194 but indians are caught in the middle they look up to the whites and look down on the blacks they clearly see themselves as being in between
2272195 many asians are deeply guilty of skin racism this is reflected in common attitudes towards black communities i know of many cases where an asian parent would rather their son or daughter marries a white person than a black person the ultimate taboo and one which is fundamentally to do with skin colour
2272196 however other less publicised complaints were also made that it was unacceptable and insulting to all sikhs to have a black man kissing a sikh woman
2272197 he is a physician and an african american she is an indian and they were facing the wrath of her parents because she was dating a black man another african american lady mentioned to me how her indian husband introduces her to his friends and family as meet my wife k she has an mba from harvard as if a degree from harvard would make her more acceptable and lighten the color of her skin
2272198 there is a cultural explanation indians have always been averse to black people out of pure aesthetic preferences for fair skin
2272199 a few days ago i had to renew my indian visa and found myself standing in line in the appropriate delhi ministry behind a nigerian
2272200 mixed race couples are no longer an issue for most communities except ours but is dating a black man still the ultimate taboo we asked four asiana readers sumitra meghna reeya and cassandra to offer the views of the asian girl on the street
2272201 indian government fought tooth and nail to prevent caste from being included as racism
2272202 white skin can hide five faults you have and colored skin can bring five faults you dont have
2272203 indian idol 3 competition a 3rd generation chinese indian is still branded
2272204 you call yourself brahmins and you clean your own toilet and you call yourself upper caste
2272205 ask your friends the indians they do it better than anyone else
2272206 australias andrew symonds was racially abused by indian fans during the home sides innings in their one day match at vadodara today
2272207 the matter will be left in he hands of the local authorities
2272208 this should not happen but the problem is trying to control the crowds and in some areas there can be some trouble
2272209 people come to watch the game and this sort of behaviour spoils the game
2272210 yes definitely these things are not good for the morale of the team it is upsetting for them
2272211 they the fans should watch and not get into these sorts of trouble and behave in the right way
2272212 if this incident has occurred i would be disappointed for andrew
2272213 we have not received any complaints about this but in general terms we have a no tolerance policy to racism and a very strict anti racism code
2272214 our anti racism policy was approved and strengthened in november 2006 with all members having signed up to this that racism will not be tolerated at any ground
2272215 that which up to this time man has not discovered
2272216 because i wished him either to live nobly or to die nobly
2272217 he is most powerful and yet does not inspire fear
2272218 until he does not regard death as better than life
2272219 unless thou falsely said that thou would put to death first him who answered worst

2272317 it would definitely limit the number of seats the bsp could get

2272330 what doesnt get inspected wont be respected if there is no accountability in an area then theres no incentive to perform with excellence in it the root causes of poor performance in a workplace are inadequate training a lack of capacity and a bad attitude it is the leaders responsibility to ensure that they pick the right people for the job properly equip them for the functions they are required to perform and above all else model confidence and optimism in their work

2272354 commercial aviation marches in lock step with the global economy closely reflecting growth and declines in gdp with on average a steady 3 4 growth year over year
2272355 in the last 10 years this steady growth has been interrupted twice first by the meltdown of the global economy in 2001 following the burst of the internet bubble which was compounded by a year of crises with the traumatic events of 9 11 the gulf war and the sars epidemic within asia and second on the immediate horizon by the extraordinary impact that the rising cost of oil is having on the global economy
2272356 from oags statistics it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before the industrys resilience will be pushed to its limits in the coming months with carriers airports and passengers alike all waiting and watching for a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel
2272357 ive been in business 10 years and ive planned more meetings this year in boston than in the past 10 years

2272361 you once wanted to become a math teacher and once a painter
2272362 and in your prep years you wished to become a writer then in secondary you wished to be an announcer
2272363 why dont you start a shift in career and work in the field you like then
2272364 which is better to work in something you like then escape to your hobby when you want to escape from life or to work in the hobby you love and you would have nowhere else to escape to
2272365 i never thought there could be anything worse than being all alone in the night but there is being all alone in a crowd

2272371 tumko barbad kar diye chorey nahin ill ruin you i wont forgive you
2272372 on monday 30 july chakrasen arrived from allahabad on tuesday night santosh organised his weekly kirtan and on wednesday morning he put his words into action
2272373 santosh and akash had stripped chakrasen naked who ran into indrajits home to save his life
2272374 so the two brahmins shouted chor chor and the pasis therefore attacked chakrasen unknowingly
2272375 this is false propaganda being spread by the samajwadi party people
2272376 shukla offered us rs 5 lakhs to drop charges against santosh mishra and akash dubey
2272377 mla shukla and the police forced drivers of the two cars we had hired to go away
2272378 woh kahen ki woh pandit hain unhay chor do tumhay ashirwad denge he said that they are pandits and they would bless you if you let them go

2272380 the panchnama had been done and the charges of political pressure are false we have obtained non bailable warrants against mishra and dubey and will soon attach their property if the remain absconding the modalities for compensation under the atrocities act are also being worked out
2272381 the whole idea is to keep delaying until everyone forgets the matter

2272392 barbosa propone una verdadera socializaci n mediante una cooperativa de servicios m ltiples como se llama hoy en d a no recomienda sociedades cooperativas de acuerdo a como entiende a ser el cooperativismo en los pa ses capitalistas sino un sistema socialista democr tico y de ra z popular

2272394 nunca hemos navegado bajo colores falsos nunca hemos tratado de confundirnos con nadie ni siquiera hemos sentido prisa por evolucionar para que nuestros nietos hubieran de gozar de privilegios de raza olvidando su punto de partida seria necesario remontarse al pasado para encontrar el color de la mezcla
2272395 nos sentimos bien con el calificativo pues modestia a un lado hemos conseguido y demostrado de modo objetivo que el hombre de color en puerto rico no es bajo concepto alguno inferior al hombre blanco en puerto rico y ha contribuido y contribuye con dar prestigio a la raza a que pertenece y al pueblo de nuestro cuna

2272405 dennis will make an excellent addition to our leadership team because of his background and extensive experience in retail channels and specialty markets we expect great things from dennis and are looking forward to seeing the results his expertise will bring to market identity
2272406 corvest fully respects the traditional distributor selling channels in the promotional products industry our promotional products subsidiaries are separate entities from market identity as a result dennis will be selling to a separate group of customers who like promotional products distributors are resellers unlike our promotional products distributor customers however market identitys customers are resellers in the retail channel
2272407 the 2008 election season provides a wealth of sales opportunities for corvests valued promotional products distributors in fact prior to launching our political campaign sale corvest was receiving orders for embroidered obama tote bags and screen printed mccain umbrellas these orders sparked our idea to launch a sale surrounding the election
2272408 the biggest problem with selling rc toy models like rc nitrocars is all the beginners who can not start adjust and break in the nitroengine we have had seven out of ten beginner customers coming back with almost the same problem the beginner has absolutely no chance to get the car up and running without the expertise of us we used almost all of our time on these issues after we began selling all beginners the nitrobook together with the car we only have one out of ten beginner customers coming back that is just fantastic for us now we can use our time on other more profitable things like selling more products
2272409 now more than ever thanks to the decline of the us dollar and the unfolding of indymac financial institutions have the responsibility to encourage their customers to spend and save wisely with so many consumers in fear over the current state of the economy its imperative for banks to calm those fears and to encourage a positive course of action
2272410 its important for organizations especially financial institutions to continue to advertise their products and services even in light of the current state of our economy expending advertising dollars is not only going to stimulate the economy but in a time when consumers are being more conservative with their disposable income it will make the difference in beating out the competition corvest promotional products are especially effective right now thanks to their low cost and high perceived value
2272411 hurricane dolly and its impact on the state of texas has served to remind us all about the need for emergency preparedness as many texans begin to return home in the coming days it is our greatest hope that theyre greeted by a sturdy home with little to no damage as storms have a tendency to do however some residents will most likely be without electricity this is the perfect opportunity for companies in all industries to be proactive about providing their valued customers and employees with branded safety lights
2272412 this new distribution channel is going to keep the product competitively priced with excellent margins for dealers
2272413 secondary schools stand to earn high profits from the sale of promotional items plush school mascots for instance hold a high sentimental value and therefore are always great sellers school supplies such as personalized pens and pencils and embroidered backpacks also sell in large numbers thanks to their practicality
2272414 weve had several customers who have been able to attend out of state sports camps and national level competitions thanks to the sale of corvests promotional products its always nice to hear the positive things that come about because of our products

2272440 mmorpg atlantica was created by producer kim taegon who wanted a change from the original mmorpg

2272444 i was busy with an mp trying to confirm the prime ministers attendance at the world conference against caste ethnicity and occupation based discriminations
2272445 the idea is to make the indian government accept that discrimination on the basis of caste did not stop with the framing of the constitution the indian governments refusal to accept caste as a form of racism in the un is reflective of a mindset that does not see caste as a problem anymore

2272461 the movement lives on in the hearts and minds of the people
2272462 however the government could include some other obc castes when the ordinance is turned into a bill
2272463 rajput vaishya brahmin yeh bhi to sab lagey huay thay
2272464 this can be struck down but only if somebody goes to the supreme court against it
2272465 it would be very difficult for the rajasthan government to justify it in court
2272466 most gujjars were herded into the agitation by whipping up a frenzy in the name of caste honour the gujjar mahapanchayat had issued diktats that anyone who does not send one family member for the agitation would be ostracized from the community which nobody would marry in that family they were also threatened with a fine of rs 11 000 per family
2272467 behind the gujjar uprising is the destruction of the way of life of pastoralist communities including gujjars
2272468 the state has been focusing on agriculture at the expense of pastoralism
2272469 the orons or the forests that surround the villages are crucial for pastoralism but the rajasthan government is taking them over for jatropha cultivation
2272470 the animal husbandry policies of the government has been promoting hybridization of cattle with foreign breed which results in breeds that need high inputs and yield low output the state policies have been resulting in sedenterisation of animals
2272471 the state cannot think beyond its own idea of development
2272472 internationally governments have made special provisions for pastoralists and it is time we realized the gravity of the issue
2272473 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2272474 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2272475 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2272476 doesnt it take quite a bit more time to be frugal
2272477 i cant seem to find time to be with my husband or children
2272478 even if it does not impress voters in up for the moment it does send out the right signal to congress dalit base in other states like haryana and mp
2272479 the brahmin candidate who represented the bsp there was a particularly unpopular one
2272480 but she has jat leader mahendra singh tikait to thank
2272481 by not taking tikaits insult lying down she sent a message to dalit masses who their leader was
2272482 but it could also be because the crucial brahmin votes that make it a tipping point for victory are more easily had in western up
2272483 eastern up is dominated by saryupari brahmins who are still close to the bjp
2272484 most of the posts in the government have been cornered by the kanyakubjas
2272485 mayawatis orders to the police brass to not register cases under the sc st atrocities act has sent out a signal in the rural areas that you can do anything to a dalit and get away with it
2272486 also that the harshness of the atrocities act creates animosity against the bsp amongst the rest
2272487 the most important task at hand is to make behenji the pm
2272488 this is a state where farmers are dying and she wastes public money in putting up her own statues
2272489 the statue politics is part of the bsps mobilization strategies over the last two decades you may see it as wasteful expenditure but for mayawati it is investment
2272490 there will be speakers a microphone and two cameras in the robots head which belpaeme said will be able to pick out humans in a room make eye contact track human gaze and interpret pointing gestures and correlate them with what is being pointed at we are going to make the robot look cute and we are going to try to trick people into teaching the robot things just as they would a small child said belpaeme
2272491 it will have the intelligence of a three to four year old in terms of competence of understanding things but we are aiming at it having interactions of a two to three year old if we can replicate that i would be over the moon the researchers hope to explore with help from developmental psychologists knowledge about child language acquisition how children learn words in the early years of life and then implement tricks that they use onto the robots
2272492 in this project we will build two robots that will learn the meaning of words through interacting with people much in the same way that young children learn conceptual knowledge from hearing adults speak to them about objects relations and actions
2272493 is to study how a robot needs to behave in order to elicit conceptual knowledge from people
2272494 linguistic and direct transmission of concepts in robot human networks this concept project which will study how robots can acquire concepts using language and how conceptual information can be transferred between robots
2272495 we want to study the fast direct exchange of knowledge between robots and we believe that we can reuse the aforementioned algorithms to allow robots to teach each other new concepts and words
2272496 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2272497 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2272498 paying attention to your credit is going to be paramount for people
2272499 to investigate multi user multi modal interaction over a shared visualization sand box using a variety of physical data manipulation tools
2272500 this powerful virtual reality device will enable scientific communities to view share and interact with large scale 2d and 3d data at the same time and will enable computer scientists to study the integration of multi sensory touch and gestural interaction techniques for seamlessly manipulating both 2d and 3d data
2272501 lambdatable is a 24 million pixel table oriented display system built using six lcd displays tiled in a 2 3 configuration with each lcd having a resolution twice that of high definition television the resolution of omegatable will be at least 24 million pixels and will have the ability to display 2d and autostereoscopic 3d simultaneously
2272502 development of omegatable and omegadesk instruments for interactive visual data exploration and collaboration
2272503 advanced visualization instruments serve as the eyepieces of a telescope or microscope enabling researchers to view their data in cyberspace and better manage the increased scale and complexity of accessing and analyzing the data the omegatable and omegadesk are such eyepieces the former supports multiple users sitting or standing around a table and the latter is a single user device that will ultimately replace the desk in one s office both unify ultra high resolution computer enhanced collaboration workspaces and autostereoscopic virtual environments with multi touch sensitive surfaces so that users can intuitively point write touch and manipulate the information displayed and communicate and share this information with remote colleagues these instruments act as digital assistants anticipating and enabling those who work with them benefiting global scientific collaboratories as well as providing a foundation for new computer science research
2272504 the development is performed in coordination with the town of vandergrift pa the people of vandergrift not only enable access to the river for prototype testing but are also actively involved in the design process to insure that the ultimate device meets their expectations for maintaining the beauty and accessibility of their local river the kiski
2272505 ionic polymers already used as sensors have the ability to dynamically generate current when they move and dr weiland and her engineering students are now trying to figure out the best size shape and array of the plastics to put in the kiski river sometime in the next five years once the array goes in on the riverbed she said if you were able to look at it you would just see a bunch of little things wiggling it wouldnt look that different from a bunch of plant life cables from the array might then connect to the towns power grid at different spots along the bank
2272506 the results showed that the kiskiminetas river or the kiski as locals call the waterway was a significant untapped natural energy resource for the town
2272507 with weilands guidance and seed funding from msi and the heinz foundation the students are now working with vandergrift residents to harness the kiski rivers energy in innovative ways while also reducing the towns energy consumption
2272508 the date is perhaps best recognized in the united states as a date to celebrate the culture and experiences of americans with mexican ancestry
2272509 as a response to the guilt and embarrassment that some women still connect with their bodies and or their sexuality

2272516 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2272517 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2272518 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2272519 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2272520 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2272521 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2272522 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

2272541 we started playing the local teen centers for a couple of months and then one night ron wilson the drummer came to me and said i had a dream about a song called surfer joe and so i listened to the words
2272542 apparently we had paid for two sides for this 45 rpm record and so we needed a second song we told ronnie to hit it and he came up with a drum cadence i suggested some drum breaks we added some chords a little melody and in a short time we had wipe out written and recorded
2272543 our manager did the crazy laugh intro and we cracked a plywood board over the microphone to make it sound like a busting surfboard and wipe out was in the can
2272544 he took it to san bernardino then hollywood and met some people who got it played on the radio that was january 1963 and by april 1963 it was number one in los angeles and number two in the united states so by july 1963 we were on a meteoric rise as the song shot up the charts internationally
2272545 we toured the world playing and surfing places like hawaii and in january 1964 we landed in australia
2272546 though the surf craze was over wipe out has gone on to have a life of its own this year it is 45 years old and though many people really dont know the surfaris name they do know wipe out worldwide frequently when we play it people say wow that sounds like the original song
2272547 well its just the way it is in southern california you drive to the beach as often as possible my girlfriend gene now my wife weve been married for 42 years now and i went on our first date at the age of 17 by driving the nearly 60 miles to doheny beach at dana point california we went surfing on that sunday afternoon and on weekends thereafter we would wear the car out by driving from glendora to doheny beach to follow our passion surfing
2272548 after you have had a number one song where do you go from there
2272549 you have a hit record but the music business is not kind
2272550 in december 1971 chuck girard from the castells and the hondells started a new group called love song
2272551 the lord tugged at my heart but at the time i didnt know who or what it was then chuck smith came out and said taste and see the lord is good something compelled me to get out of my chair and i grabbed my wife and sons hands and we went forward to accept the lord that night it was december of 1971 and since then weve been riding along the crest of the wave with the lord
2272552 for the current wipe out cd we decided to write and record eight new original songs plus new recordings of wipe out and surfer joe the two classics are that not easy to find these days so we rerecorded them for this cd
2272553 what ive noticed over the years as we have been doing surf music in a christian ministry vein is that people really want to hold their families together
2272554 parents are looking for anything they can have in common with their sons and daughters
2272555 what the beauty of this is i have my two sons and my wife on stage with me
2272556 god has brought our family together through music through the lord and through the power of christ his awesome love puts his covering over us and it enables us to stay together as a unit and thats the center of our ministry to be an example of gods love and desire to hold families together
2272557 we are still doing concerts and plan to continue as god empowers and leads
2272558 it has been my desire to build a foundation to help families to encourage uplift and unify this desire goes beyond playing concerts and benefits where families can attend together and share our joy with surf music i have noticed for a number of years that people have been encouraged and strengthened with gods blessings through music and it is my hope that playing the surfaris music will continue to grow and work to benefit and nurture the family unit
2272559 from day one we said that we will only submit a planning application if we can design a wind turbine development that is appropriate for the location
2272560 the results of study work carried out so far continues to suggest that rushy mead is a good location to site wind turbines although we have found that the responsible maximum number of turbines should now be set at five rather than six
2272561 it appears the industry is targeting the most vulnerable groups through advertising and manipulation of menthol levels
2272562 there are no iron clad guarantees but you have some pretty strong indicators how the board thinks
2272563 we are prudent and responsible management and our capital as well as our shareholders are well protected
2272564 astra has been wonderful to work with and this toy show has been a fantastic venue to launch the phd the level of interest from the retailers even exceeds our expectations
2272565 we are thrilled that phd productions has joined astra and chose the astra annual marketplace to launch their phd pocket disc
2272566 when i was making it i put too many double stitches in the crochet around the edges and it curled in on the end
2272567 when i was finally done with it we tried to make it flat but it still curled in
2272568 i was a little bit embarrassed i was thinking maybe i just slighted this childs creation by picking it up and throwing it
2272569 once we had this idea we immediately began thinking of where the skills were to make the phds
2272570 the crocheting craft is actually an indigenous skill in mayan culture
2272571 we recognized immediately that this is helping maintain traditions and providing employment so we are pleased to be working with a longstanding importer who has specialized in fair trade production
2272572 i just cant think of a way that these could hurt someone
2272573 well when its used inside its a perfectly harmless device that prevents home destruction because it wont knock vases or lamps over
2272574 when you are feeding them fresh fruits or corn on the cob or cantalope or watermelon it helps behavior if you eat good food you are happier
2272575 a man with moderate views who expresses them in an extreme fashion
2272576 forget all the talk about a knowledge economy were still a country where the land owning rule over the landless of 180 million dalits 120 are still engaged directly or indirectly with dalit education and employment may be the future but the root of violence against dalits today is land the landowning expects a lifetime of free labour from the landless
2272577 what is important is that a dalit needs to culturally transform himself to overcome the ingrained idea of being the lowest of the low it should be left to individuals to decide what they want to convert to
2272578 but that is also a sort of conversion a transformation of the self
2272579 you know amartya sen did not see caste as important enough to talk about it in his book
2272580 this years gngwc will begin with regional preliminary in germany i wish that gamers who love korean online games from different countries would be able to communicate and build friendship through gngwc
2272581 indians only stand up for a cause if it suits their current state of conscience its a conditional open mindedness
2272582 and just imagine the support that the campaign against the inequal section 377 would recieve were a group like yfe to support it
2272583 reservations are screwing the country where the hell are those lgbt groups why arent they doing anything

2272585 whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man woman or animal shall be punished with 152 imprisonment for life or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine explanation penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section
2272586 the breadth and quality of free software offerings is in fact overwhelming and many of our choices were difficult please let us know what we missed
2272587 by focusing on the genotype of the virus information which is inexpensive and easily available and combining this with clinical information about the patient researchers behind the eu funded euresist project developed new mathematical prediction models in cases where there is a long history of resistance this is an indicator of death so it is important to try all the possibilities says francesca incardona for non crucial cases this may help reduce the cost of the therapy by choosing the right combination of drugs that work for the longest time she suggests
2272588 medical researchers and doctors can now predict what would happen if a patient with a certain type of virus and certain viral load is given a certain combination of antiretroviral therapy arvt
2272589 three different but complementary programmes were developed by the project partners each uses the same type of mathematical model to classify a given drug combination as successful or unsuccessful but is fed with different information in fact three approaches are used to extract data from the database to account for different aspects of the disease evolution
2272590 selecting anti hiv therapies based on a variety of genomic and clinical factors
2272591 optimizing hiv therapies is crucial since the virus rapidly develops mutations to evade drug pressure recent studies have shown that genotypic information might not be sufficient for the design of therapies and that other clinical and demographical factors may play a role in therapy failure this study is designed to assess the improvement in prediction achieved when such information is taken into account we use these factors to generate a prediction engine using a variety of machine learning methods and to determine which clinical conditions are most misleading in terms of predicting the outcome of a therapy
2272592 three different machine learning techniques were used generative discriminative method regression with derived evolutionary features and regression with a mixture of effects all three methods had similar performances with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc of 0 77 a set of three similar engines limited to genotypic information only achieved an auc of 0 75 a straightforward combination of the three engines consistently improves the prediction with significantly better prediction when the full set of features is employed the combined engine improves on predictions obtained from an online state of the art resistance interpretation system

2272608 health chiefs tell nhs trusts not to wait for npfit
2272609 an nhs patient agreeing to a course of treatment should also be taken to have agreed that information given during the course of the treatment might be made available for future medical research projects so long as robust systems are in place to protect personal information and privacy
2272610 however implied consent is not satisfactory without considerable transparency in the case of the nhs we strongly encourage it to build on its existing efforts to educate patients by making general and widely advertised statements about how people s health information might be used in the future
2272611 recommendation 17 we recommend that the nhs should develop a system to allow approved researchers to work with healthcare providers to identify potential patients who may then be approached to take part in clinical studies for which consent is needed these approved researchers would be bound by the same duty of confidentiality as the clinical team providing care and face similar penalties in the case of any breach of confidentiality if legislation is necessary to implement such a scheme then we would urge government to bring that legislation forward as quickly as possible
2272612 i became an avid reader developed critical thinking a thirst for knowledge and a desire to help others like me
2272613 we dont advertise in private schools because the government school going dalit tends to be poorer more excluded
2272614 what do you know about babasaheb ambedkar his life and mission what do you plan to achieve in life how do you plan to help others in your adult life
2272615 to plant the seeds of dr ambedkars message in young minds
2272616 i am willing to expand the scholarship to other states provided i can find reliable volunteers
2272617 i know children who can not read and write in their native language even after the 10th grade
2272618 i was discouraged to go to school by my high school teachers
2272619 and i still remember those incidents and tell my children about them to their utter disbelief
2272620 such a scheme supports a conscious yearning to succeed against all odds
2272621 without reservations dalits would not be in the position where there are now but if dalit children are imparted good education there would be no need for reservations until then reservations are important for dalits to become part of the elite
2272622 i believe it is my duty to give back to society what society has given me
2272623 such extreme violence in the name of corporal punishment clearly indicates that the teacher in question was personally unstable and took out his frustration on students
2272624 we regularly get calls from children complaining about corporal punishment chandigarh tops the number of complaints and in delhi south delhi gets the most phone calls
2272625 we take the child in confidence and our childline workers meet him and try to get him to open up and tell the whole story
2272626 then we go to the school principal in question armed with a letter from government authorities often maintaining the childs request for anonymity our aim is to stop physical abuse in the school
2272627 problem with teachers is they are not willing to listen to children
2272628 beating a child can only make him or her more stubborn teachers should use a different language to communicate with students there are so many ways to communicate
2272629 which is why we have been organizing day long discussion sessions with teachers as pat of the governments national initivate for child protection initially their response in such seminars is so youve come here to teach us they begin with insisting on their right to punish in order to fulfil their duty to maintain discipline and make students obey orders but gradually the come about to see our point and we set some introspection in motion
2272630 isolated incidents of misuse cannot form the ground to strike down
2272631 minor beating which is in the interest of the child himself herself which is not of a persistent or a habitual nature
2272632 but the day is for the remembrance and acknowledgement of those teachers who have been the most influential in our lives
2272633 being hit on his cheek by a teacher had left a mark on his face one that he did not want to go to school with every day
2272634 the greatest reason why we must oppose even minor corporal punishment as a society is because the practice legitimizes in young minds the use of violence as a means to an end
2272635 you are doing the same thing that you accuse them of doing paint them all in the same colour
2272636 maybe that could be a made a requirement but how many people could afford to do a double graduation in india
2272637 1 is it right to judge a teacher purely on the basis on whether s he used the cane

2273147 as stated above the boundaries of the width of the power namely the ceiling limit of 5o the numerical benchmark the principle of creamy layer the compelling reasons namely backwardness inadequacy of representation and the overall administrative efficiency are not obliterated by the impugned amendments at the appropriate time we have to consider the law as enacted by various states providing for reservation if challenged at that time we have to see whether limitations on the exercise of power are violated the state is free to exercise its discretion of providing for reservation subject to limitation namely that there must exist compelling reasons of backwardness inadequacy of representation in a class of post s keeping in mind the overall administrative efficiency it is made clear that even if the state has reasons to make reservation as stated above if the impugned law violates any of the above substantive limits on the width of the power the same would be liable to be set aside
2273148 we reiterate that the ceiling limit of 50 the concept of creamy layer and the compelling reasons namely backwardness inadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency are all constitutional requirements without which the structure of equality of opportunity in article 16 would collapse

2273215 it was a difficult race right from the beginning hamiltons pace seemed unbeatable and i understood that it would be very hard to beat him i never had good grip and in the final stages i also had brake problems and was not even able to attack piquet whom i congratulate on the first podium of his career we must try and understand why this weekend we have not been a match for our rivals they have definitely improved but i think this was more a case of us having taken a step backwards however we are still confident we have the ability to get out of this situation right from the next race
2273216 this was definitely not the kind of race we had been hoping for we have struggled all weekend and we have to try and understand why usually our race pace is always good but today that was not the case because i almost always suffered with a lack of grip only in the final stages did the situation improve a little bit but it was never enough to be competitive we have a test in jerez where we will try and improve the car so as to arrive in budapest in better shape this is definitely not a crisis but we have to study carefully the handling of the car to understand if we have taken the right road in terms of development
2273217 i nailed it this afternoon when the team told me i had to build a 23 second gap in just seven laps i knew i had to drive over the limit and i did but i knew we had the best car this weekend and felt comfortable pushing hard to make up the gap in the final stint i had to work for todays win when the safety car came out i questioned whether i should pit but i trusted the team to make the best decision on strategy it didnt quite work out but i knew we had the pace in the car to keep pushing and want to say a big thank you to heikki who realised i was quicker i was able to slipstream past felipe and then thought my work was done then i had to do it all again to get past nelson but i made a couple of textbook moves to get past them both everybody in this team has worked so hard to make this victory happen we mustnt grow complacent but must feel assured that our efforts are being rewarded we couldnt have asked for more today

2273234 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints

2273239 i have no more news about yossi he will be staying and i am really pleased with kuyt he will be staying
2273240 i have talked to yossi and told him i want to keep him he is a player with quality and has shown that during pre season
2273241 i also talked with dirk kuyt this morning i am really pleased with him
2273242 xabi scored a good goal after scoring a penalty against rangers on saturday so this is very positive
2273243 he is showing that he is a good professional but then we already knew this and i am very pleased with his commitment on the pitch
2273244 there will be two new signings the names theyre the names youve heard jeremy menez of monaco and benayoun are both top class players
2273245 steven will be out for more or less a week
2273246 of course it gets a little bit more difficult as you get older but i have enjoyed this pre season i have played and i feel fit
2273247 we all get older but there are a lot of young lads who keep me fit in this team
2273248 hopefully it wont be my last opportunity but of course every year we have high hopes that well be closer to the top this year is the same
2273249 we have strengthened the team with good quality players in the summer and hopefully we will be stronger this season
2273250 it was a good work out for us and that was the main point to get a good work out before the season
2273251 we have been working hard and it showed a little bit against valerenga i think we will be ready for next week and the champions league qualifier
2273252 some men throw their gifts away on a life of mediocrity great men throw everything they have into their gifts and achieve a life of success

2273256 liverpool want to make it clear that they have no intention of denying their players their wish of playing in the tournament
2273257 it was just a bit of fun really we supplied them with crowd footage taken from a home game of every premiership club and they made their decision about liverpool fans both male and female being the most attractive
2273258 the serious side of it i suppose was to prove that with hd you really can focus in on a face in the crowd without a problem
2273259 yes its true that beauty is subjective and in the eye of the beholder but i have spent 15 years as a top talent spotter for international model agencies which means ive worked with some of the heavyweights in the tv world on the catwalks and advertising so i think i kind of know what im talking about
2273260 but there is also a criteria that you have to typically take into account
2273261 there are important things to look for such as symmetrical face the glossiness of the hair and lips being perfectly full
2273262 i know a good face a face that can sell i can take one look at someone and tell them if they are givenchy or primark
2273263 were planning something major very soon in the wake of this and liverpool is definitely right up there as the first stop

2273266 in some ways made things more difficult because the expectations became so high then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying ok the next step will be the premier league title
2273267 but then when you dont win it people say oh you cant go to that next step when maybe we were operating at the next level up but because the other teams around us were progressing as well it didnt seem that way
2273268 in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a champions league winner people are talking now about us not having won the league for 18 years but it was 21 years since this club had last won the european cup
2273269 the key is not to say that we can win the title because its clear that its the most difficult league in the world to win look at the final of the champions league last season it was between chelsea and united who are at the top of the table in england
2273270 its clear that we are going in the right direction and progressing we have got good young players coming through who will be important while those with experience are settling down now so it could be a very good season for us
2273271 everybody can see that the team and squad is improving every year and that now we are much better but will that be enough to win the title thats the big question because it depends on the other teams as well

2273275 of course it gets a little bit more difficult as you get older but i have enjoyed this pre season
2273276 i have played and i feel fit we all get older but there are a lot of young lads who keep me fit in this team

2273278 castes and communities whose literacy rate is at least 8 less than the state or district average
2273279 prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion race caste sex or place of birth
2273280 nothing in this article or in clause 2 or article 29 shall prevent the state from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes
2273281 castes and communities whose literacy rate is at least 8 less than the state or district average
2273282 5 regarding the condition at d till information regarding the position of each caste in the government of indias services becomes readily available it may be presumed that this factor is fulfilled by a caste community sub caste synonym sub entry in case it is found that it fulfills the guideline in c 3
2273283 1 the above social educational and economic guidelines for consideration of requests for inclusion in the list of other backward classes are intended to aid the bench commission to identify castes and communities which deserve to be included in the list of obc in terms of the national commission for backward classes act and not to fetter due exercise of discretion by it
2273284 now about a caste having to qualify on all the counts in each category if we had caste censuses after independence it would have been possible to check whether they qualified on all counts qualification on any count therefore does provide indicative knowledge on the status of a caste that actually was adequate for policy to be framed and was also never questioned by the courts
2273285 the bench is usually composed of a retired supreme court justice and a senior bureaucrat and not politicians whose discretion you might question
2273286 if it should be so extend that logic to the open category as well let only the poor uniformly across all castes backward or forward enjoy the benefits of higher education
2273287 they knew that the bureaucracy had to reflect the diversity in society so that all future bureaucrats could exercise their individual powers of discretion to benefit all possible vested interests
2273288 i dont think you got my point i said the iits iims should be not need to be closed down because institutions which have a history of serving the needs of only section of indians cant be supported by public money and they cant be allowed to function even on private funding because of the same reasons and because theyd have to justify and account for and compensate for all the misuse of public funds in the past i dont think they can afford that im predicting the birth of a new political debate issue
2273289 seen in that context mechanisms like deprivation indices etc which insist on measuring multiple disadvantages not just one like caste are impossible to implement in india
2273290 the lesson from history has been the record of the ruling classes on this count has been very poor to nil
2273291 frankly like most people from the lower castes whove watched this so called debate for too many years decades i often wonder too often these days is it worth bothering about

2273393 you hear often that joseph had no polygamous offspring the reason of this is very simple abortion was practiced on a large scale in nauvoo dr john c bennett the evil genius of joseph brought this abomination into a scientific system he showed to my husband and me the instruments with which he used to operate for joseph there was a house in nauvoo right across the flat about a mile and a half from the town a kind of hospital they sent the women there when they showed signs of celestial consequences abortion was practiced regularly in this house

2273399 yes there was some talk about joseph getting no issue from all the women he had intercourse with dr foster spoke to me about the fact but i dont remember what was told about abortion if i heard things of the kind i didnt believe in them at that time joseph was very free in his talk about his women he told me one day of a certain girl and remarked that she had given him more pleasure than any girl he had ever enjoyed i told him it was horrible to talk like this

2273408 i am confident about my squad and i am happy that we have the best squad since i arrived at anfield but the key is not to say we will win the title because the premier league is now the best and most difficult in europe
2273409 the standard has gone up so much since i arrived here
2273410 back then there were good players in the league but spain italy and germany all signed some of the best players in the world
2273411 now everybody wants to come here and that quality is amazing
2273412 just look at the champions league three of the last four were from england and arsenal played really well in the competition too
2273413 so you have to get past the three best teams in europe to win the premier league
2273414 that will not be easy but it makes for an incredible league we have improved and progressed every year since i arrived but look at the history of the league
2273415 we got 82 points which was a record for liverpool and that has allowed us only to finish third the standard has risen massively and we have had to work to keep up
2273416 they are the best in europe they can spend 20million on players just for the bench but my belief is unshakeable that we can compete with them
2273417 we are not the richest club and we have had a lot of work to do but i have kept my desire and my confidence that it is possible to win
2273418 when i arrived maybe i didnt realise exactly how big a job it would be but once inside you learn little by little the things about your club that nobody knows
2273419 it has been slower than we like because the others are so strong but last season was the best squad we have had and this year could be better
2273420 it has not been ideal because we have had to bring in maybe seven or eight players a year and that cant help you win things
2273421 the squad we had at the start did not have a very high value and this squad is the equal in value of the other top teams we have been spending big but selling big and the net is less than the other big clubs
2273422 they were spending to add to very strong squads already where we have created a totally new squad
2273423 there are only three or four players now from when we arrived but they are very very good players and we have a very very good squad maybe our european success hasnt helped us because it made people believe we were ready to challenge for the league when we were not
2273424 now though we are in the position we always wanted to be you can say its the starting point in a way but we have the benefit of learning from the mistakes of recent seasons and we are at another level now
2273425 i always had confidence i would be here because i went through a similar thing in spain
2273426 the only thing you can do is work harder and keep confidence in yourself
2273427 i had fantastic support from the staff and i think we learned a lot from it
2273428 the fans were amazing too and i feel a responsibility to them because they give so much it would be nice to give them something back

2273430 for a while now there are reports in the press saying our club is after xabi alonso and that even a deal has been reached upon his transfer
2273431 today a lot of newspapers published news that we were negotiating with liverpool and that we had a tactical strategy of bargaining
2273432 these reports are not true our club has no intention on transferring xabi alonso
2273433 i want to go there tomorrow to see the character of my players and see who has the kind of spirit to play in this stadium
2273434 the problem is that friendlies cannot return you on the path to europe i think we must go back to what we have done in the past three years qualifying for europe through the front door not through friendlies

2273440 don is a terrific guy and certainly has a bright future ahead of him but we just decided we wanted to move in a new direction with our male anchor
2273441 but we simply could not agree on the terms so she decided not to accept our offer and pursue something else

2273444 its hard to work anywhere where theres so much uncertainty

2273450 many exorcists think that the majority of the partially possessed who rebel this way never get priestly help they are taken to doctors and psychiatrists who never succeed in helping them the subjects may often spend time in mental institutions and there they will become progressively worse as their awful battle goes on
2273451 after enjoying this simple and comfortable view for some years i finally awoke to the probability that there might be sources of spiritual teaching wisdom and assurance outside of aa
2273452 aa had provided me with the spiritual home and climate wherein i was welcome and could do useful work this was very fine all to the good

2273459 when a government becomes powerful it is destructive extravagant and violent it is an usurper which takes bread from innocent mouths and deprives honorable men of their substance for votes with which to perpetuate itself

2273461 in all that people can do for themselves the government ought not to interfere

2273488 the financial discussions relating to the transfer had nothing to do with alan curbishley
2273489 he has never been involved in player transfer and contract negotiations
2273490 its the manager and his management team who are responsible for paying out the players salary
2273491 he puts his photographs on food packets for those affected by the floods in surat now it is even on condom packets it is embarrassing
2273492 yes the chief minister and my photographs are there but the intention was to make these things available to poor people
2273493 literally that man became naked meaning he became completely and brazenly shameless there is no more apt sentence to describe what narendra modi and his government have been doing since he took over as chief minister five years ago source
2273494 only our journalist friends who thronged our place at the mehar chand market in delhi have ditched us
2273495 the larger question here may be the most troublesome although i dont know the intention of the ioc the result sounds like an attempt to cover up for chinese people can speak for themselves on this matter from my experience with the chinese they understand the reality of the pollution i think although they will not be pleased with all the pollution they would not deny that it is actual air pollution the ioc is doing them a disservice by pretending otherwise the ioc should stick with what they know athletics and leave air quality to scientists

2273497 mr ranger how many miles of caverns havent been discovered yet
2273498 you can do ph d quality research on the website
2273499 were not trying to make it possible for you not to come in here
2273500 they are taking a part of me because i grew up here
2273501 we are looking at maintenance issues on the transformer and were running on one transformer and then that one went out
2273502 we are using all available resources to get back up and running at full power
2273503 the economic benefits for years to come are absolutely and indisputably tremendous
2273504 i am absolutely totally disappointed that the webbs were not here today
2273505 and as purchasers of private property they can do with it has they wish
2273506 our downtown belongs to all citizens not just the developers of this project
2273507 and we came to the point where we are today
2273508 but we want people to come and enjoy this project
2273509 i think its definitely a step forward for the good of the community
2273510 we believed down deep we were right i still think we are right
2273511 but at the end the day we lost and they won its the project were going to get so we hope its everything that has been promised to us
2273512 its a lot of stuff to do in a couple of days
2273513 these are not final designs by any stretch of the imagination but they show what can be done
2273514 you look at these project concepts and think how crazy they are
2273515 then watch the olympics look at what theyve recently built in beijing and think again they wont look so crazy a month from now
2273516 wed be surprised if centrepointe wasnt winning in a way
2273517 a lot of people want to support whats easy what theyre used to seeing whats being done elsewhere
2273518 i dont care how many people laugh and make fun of these projects
2273519 if we can get 1 500 people to look at these ideas and think about design then weve accomplished something
2273520 once our kids get to be middle school and high school age there is a lack of motivation to do as well as they can
2273521 we have no trouble motivating kids to do alright on a friday night at a football field theyll give an above and beyond effort
2273522 high schools have more categories and the more categories you have the less likely you are to make these pass fail grades
2273523 the important point i want to make is thats not a kentucky picture its a national picture
2273524 but i think its very important for the public to know if you look at all the kids in the district we made positive movement in every single subgroup except for one
2273525 wherever its working is where our folks are going to go to get good ideas from
2273526 weve got to implement changes and it may require legislative action to initiate those
2273527 these schools if we dont intervene now in a dramatic sort of way then its not going to happen for them
2273528 some folks will look at curriculum and instructional practice but the first thing you have to begin to do is build a culture of high expectations
2273529 that gives the kind of motivation that exists with students in other cultures
2273530 these designs appear radical when compared to atlanta but not when compared to beijing and chicago
2273531 atlanta is not necessarily the direction we want to move in to get inspiration
2273532 it seemed shockingly large to us self contained like a gated community
2273533 brilliant it demonstrates that the school is not just a place to get an education but is an incubator for ideas
2273534 the people who are involved financially who own the land theyre all traveling they ought to be traveling right down here
2273535 thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard and we keep hearing these dumb things from people who were going to have to live with what theyre going to do for no telling how long
2273536 its shameful shameful that the webbs the others involved and their legal people
2273537 our judgment was that there was essentially no more reason for us keep fighting it legally because we knew the odds of prevailing were extraordinarily narrow
2273538 apparently the need to ram this project through has created tremendous stress on the developers
2273539 we have to operate on whats going on when we get there
2273540 law enforcement should have been enforcing a law that says you should not be harassed
2273541 it has never been our policy to ask nursing mothers to leave our restaurant i have taken the necessary steps to ensure this mistake does not happen again
2273542 this is a young woman who is taking really good care of her baby and now she is being penalized
2273543 theres no way that they can discredit what were trying to say
2273544 we cant even compete on any category on an international basis
2273545 the economists will tell you there has never been a transfer of wealth on the scale thats going on now

2273548 when i die nobody will take care of my grave
2273549 well daddy you know that ill always take care of it as long as i live and when im gone hopefully one of the kids will take care of it
2273550 you dont never have to worry about your grave being taken care of
2273551 this is one of the most calmest places youve ever been to
2273552 to me its relaxing to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and worry and theyre sure not going to argue back with you
2273553 a lot of people might want to take care of their grave sites but they dont like to come
2273554 but i think thats probably the last thing you can do for anybody is to show them how much you care
2273555 franks experience as a state representative his service as a local school board member and his deep understanding of kentuckys p 12 education system make him a natural choice for the job
2273556 i am looking forward to continuing our collaboration on education issues and to interacting with the department of educations staff
2273557 and then continue to sing the song quite well i might add
2273558 this plane can teach you more things and give you more gifts than i ever could it wont get you a better job a faster car or a bigger house but if you treat it with respect and keep your eyes open it may remind you of some things you used to know that life is in the moment joy matters more than money the world is a beautiful place and that dreams really truly are possible
2273559 if you are part of a society that votes then do so there may be no candidates and no measures you want to vote for but there are certain to be ones you want to vote against in case of doubt vote against by this rule you will rarely go wrong
2273560 if this is too blind for your taste consult some well meaning fool there is always one around and ask his advice then vote the other way this enables you to be a good citizen if such is your wish without spending the enormous amount of time on it that truly intelligent exercise of franchise requires
2273561 i think he wants maximum flexibility to be able to to do what he believes needs to be done inside of iraq
2273562 but keep in mind for example one of general petraeus responsibilities is not to think about how could we be using some of that 10 billion a month to shore up a u s economy that is really hurting right now if im president of the united states that is part of my responsibility

2273572 im delighted that act is campaigning to increase every familys wealth by 500 a week in order to beat australia
2273573 with labour having dragged our economy down to its current state over the past nine years and national leader john key promising more of the same the only way to achieve this goal is to have a strong act presence in parliament
2273574 economic growth is the key to raising the countrys standard of living and affects every facet of new zealand society from providing timely access to healthcare to enabling us to keep our all blacks from joining clubs overseas
2273575 in our current state we can afford neither with just one percent extra annual growth over the past 40 years we could have been the fourth wealthiest western nation today instead we are poorer than everyone but portugal
2273576 only act has the policies to change that policies that reward productivity not penalise it and create the incentives needed to encourage growth
2273577 it has taken a man of god perhaps to do what nobody else has been able to do since the general election season began getbarack obama and john mccain together on the same stage before their party conventions later this summer
2273578 gandhi tried to disinherit and decentre the middle class the memory of that still hurts
2273579 dalits across the uk felt that within the indian community their identity was based on caste and that the caste system was very much in operation
2273580 this is an issue which the government and all those concerned about good community relations need to address
2273581 during campaigning i was told that i would not get peoples vote as i was a chamar a derogatory name for dalits so i filed my nomination in a non asian constituency and was able to win
2273582 everyone in the indian community knows how things are it is there and it will take a long time to die out i recently discovered from my children that they suffered difficulties at school it is only now because the issue is being raised that they chose to tell me given everything that has happened i am very proud and thankful to god for what i have gained
2273583 the non dalits in my community objected to my promotion and did not support me in my work they did not like me as a supervisor the non dalits presume that chamars are good for nothing
2273584 at work there is no open discrimination it is usually discreet most of the businesses are small if you complain the person who will listen to your complaint is from the higher caste so no action is taken
2273585 it is a big issue in india but not here there is a broader community and different traditions people live happily together
2273586 i am the mp and people come to me who are from the lowest castes

2273600 ignoring a government regulation i increased my volume by more than the permitted 25 percent of the licensed capacity if i had to go to jail for the excess production of a commodity that most indians needed i didnt mind
2273601 hes been our ace for a while its always a good feeling when hes pitching especially against cincinnati hes had success against them the numbers say that
2273602 i thought about letting him go deeper but the seventh was a little stressful
2273603 that three run homer by pence was the difference in the game
2273604 its tough to keep getting behind like that especially when the guy over there is a pretty tough pitcher its tough to play catch up consistently and when he gets ahead like that he can relax and throw whatever he wants at any time in the count
2273605 i got out of the first inning and cruised after that i threw a lot of pitches in the first but after we scored a few runs it seemed like they started swinging early in the count and giving up at bats
2273606 if it was up to me id be in there but once im back i want to be back for the duration
2273607 hey lets throw only 2 different songs on there and well rake in the cash
2273608 to be frank im embarrassed for the a a p today
2273609 treatment with medications in the absence of any clear data i hope theyre ready for the public backlash
2273610 certainly you have to be real careful what you ask for sometimes i havent asked for anything i understand that its not always greener on the other side i do know that when you have to play 162 games you just never know whats going to happen
2273611 fill this blank space with adverts for pubs and clubs
2273612 i heard today that graffiti is very expensive to remove all i have to say about this is does it not cost a lot of money to pay people who clean up urine vomit and flyers
2273613 i think the catchers knee got him in his leg and then hunter came into his back a little bit
2273614 oh it would be nice to know how theyre doing
2273615 hey so great to hear from you hows it going
2273616 he was better than the last time i faced him
2273617 his breaking pitch was sharp if he pitches like he did tonight hes going to be tough
2273618 i was just trying to make contact use the middle of the field get the run in and not hit a ground ball
2273619 i wasnt able to execute on a couple of pitches and ended up giving up homers
2273620 it was an amazing thing why not doubles all homers
2273621 we were trying to get 75 pitches in and i was able to go a little deeper
2273622 the feeling of the game let me know i could go a little deeper or at least try i dont regret it i hope the next time out im able to do that and do even better
2273623 and afzal was not given legal counsel at the trial stage
2273624 the first point raised by mr sushil kumar appearing for the accused afzal was that he was denied proper legal aid thereby depriving him of effective defence in the course of trial in sum and substance the contention is that the counsel appointed by the court as amicus curiae to take care of his defence was thrust on him against his will and the first amicus appointed made concessions with regard to the admission of certain documents and framing of charges without his knowledge it is further submitted that the counsel who conducted the trial did not diligently cross examine the witnesses it is therefore contended that his valuable right of legal aid flowing from articles 21 and 22 is violated we find no substance in this contention the learned trial judge did his best to afford effective legal aid to the accused afzal when he declined to engage a counsel on his own we are unable to hold that the learned counsel who defended the accused at the trial was either inexperienced or ineffective or otherwise handled the case in a casual manner the criticism against the counsel seems to be an after thought raised at the appellate stage it was rightly negatived by the high court
2273625 for the simple reason that the desire to see his life extinct reflects societys desire to disown his act of crime as being inhuman but what santosh did was very human born out of human impulses and has to
2273626 for the simple reason that the indian judiciary says that capital punishment should be given in the rarest of rare cases and this is not one of them rapes and murders take place all the time
2273627 for the simple reason that hanging santosh kumar singh will not bring priyadarshini mattoo back to life
2273628 for the simple reason that it will give all the more reason to future rapists to murder the woman after raping her lest letting her live make it easier for her to identify him come up with evidence and thus ensuring that he is hanged to death
2273629 for the simple reason that the desire to see his life extinct reflects societys desire to disown his act of crime as being inhuman but what santosh did was very human born out of human impulses and has to be resolved within the parameters of human society not outside it not with an equally inhuman form of punishment
2273630 i hope to see a post from you in this regard and the customarty sic a la afzal stance vis a vis your moral opposition to the death penalty or is it something that should be exclusivley sic reserved for friendly neighbourhood terrorist thuggs from across the border and
2273631 p s i wrote a post saying that mohd afzal should not be hanged in the unsolved parliament attack case ten days after the supreme court pronounced the sentence i am writing a post saying that santosh kumar singh should not be hanged 1 day after the sentence has been pronounced all those loonies suggesting that afzal was defended because he was muslim and santosh is not being defended lay off it is you whose politics has a gaping moral hole not me
2273632 capital punishment has not proved to be a deterrent in reducing crime
2273633 let he who has not sinned cast the first stone
2273634 so their families dont have to experience the loss we have
2273635 to recruit the kind of national leader that we want and that kentuckians deserve the cpe president must be positioned as a close adviser to the governor
2273636 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2273637 should this happen dhl will cede significant elements of cost and quality to one of its chief competitors consumers all over america would suffer
2273638 state takeover is the absolute last resort and there are no plans to implement that for any schools
2273639 might have convinced them that state takeover is not such a good idea
2273640 the basic problem with state takeover of a school is that many state departments of education are not equipped to do it
2273641 when it comes to no child left behind its layered over the state school reform
2273642 it doesnt quite fit like a hand into a glove
2273643 unfortunately what we see in most parts of the country is that states and school districts do nothing
2273644 there are so few places that have tried a fundamental overhauling of a school that we just dont know how to do that well
2273645 try to figure out if there is something at the district level that is contributing to these problems
2273646 i worry about next year because were going up again about 8 percent and 10 percent
2273647 he dedicated himself to his students he touched a lot of peoples lives
2273648 in this day and time prejudice on the basis of sex race creed or ethnic origin should not and cannot be tolerated
2273649 he was the most respected person in the community i know
2273650 a lesser administrator would have caved in to the demands
2273651 the next year the team to the went to the state tournament
2273652 we have private investors who dont want to be part of the public discussion they are private people
2273653 has demonstrated yet again that lexington has difficulty dealing with development issues
2273654 i do not consider it to be a perfect development
2273655 but on balance there has never been a doubt in my mind but that the best interests of lexington are served by the completion of centrepointe
2273656 how sure are we at this point that the project will be built dont we have to know how its going to be financed and shouldnt the city have to have that answered
2273657 tif makes this a public project and it is in the public interest to ask these questions
2273658 the more you know about the financing the better but it is not critical
2273659 we would be honored to host the breeders cup at keeneland and we have asked hok sport to build that consideration into their development plans
2273660 it would be very exciting to have the championship in central kentucky and we would be remiss if we didnt explore the opportunity the facility review will provide guidance as to its feasibility
2273661 keeneland is one of the most appreciated legends of thoroughbred horse racing and we will respect her status as we make plans to modernize the racecourse
2273662 we fully intend to make the most of our 25 year history and experience in sports facility design to give keeneland fans the world over not just a renovated racecourse but an experience worthy of their loyalty
2273663 i do not consider it to be a perfect development
2273664 but on balance there has never been any doubt in my mind but that the best interests of lexington are served by the completion of centrepointe
2273665 one of the most significant welfare issues affecting any equine breed or discipline
2273666 should be abolished since the acknowledged conflicts of interest which involve many of them cannot be reasonably resolved
2273667 there are very few disciplines of animal performance that dont include abuses the walking horse folks are not unique but their egregious practices are really unacceptable
2273668 i had been looking for a trip to get over there
2273669 we were hit with this blast of hot air when we got off the plane it felt like it was 200 degrees
2273670 apparently they have some system where if they get any warning that theres some difficulty they throw these flares out so if theres a heat seeking missile or something like that it will go after the flares
2273671 it probably was a false alarm but it made everybody a little nervous
2273672 everything there is either made out of cement or some kind of faux marble
2273673 iranian battle helmets taken from dead iranians killed in the war
2273674 it was a very good back and forth frank discussion of whats going on over there
2273675 i have a great deal of respect for him and what hes accomplished hes quelled a lot of this violence youve got to give him the credit for it
2273676 there is an issue with exporting 128 encryption from the usa where the app store server is located 128 bits is seen as a dangerous weapon

2273678 he said the taliban issued a press statement calling all media outlets in the province of ghazni which has a large taliban presence to cover them carrying out the shariah on a few burglars in their custody
2273679 david is a young player but we knew when we signed him that he had a lot of ability and a lot of potential
2273680 it can sometimes be difficult for young players when they move to a new club but he has done well and it will be good for his confidence that he has already scored two goals
2273681 it is now important that he keeps on working hard and trying to get better because he still needs to improve i think that he will do that
2273682 his goals are positive but equally important is his movement because this shows that he has game intelligence which was one of the main reasons why we brought him to liverpool
2273683 the names theyre the names youve heard menez and benayoun are both top class players
2273684 loosely already take the line i wants my morning round
2273685 with a lot of gasping and panting sally does her morning gymnastics
2273686 come on take the leash i wanna go for my morning round
2273687 diego is a good keeper technically he is almost perfect and he is quite complete it is important for him to come in and do well and because if he does that it can only be good for the squad
2273688 it is always positive to have competition for places and it is no different for me hopefully diego will continue to play well and that will make me play well also because that will be good for the team
2273689 its all about improving little by little and hopefully i will get some more time on the pitch in our next game results now are not significant but the way we play is
2273690 we are looking to get better in every game and the way we pressed and counter attacked against rangers showed we are going in the right direction but we know there are things we will still need to improve
2273691 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
2273692 it is close to the team for next week we have some players at the olympic games so we used some young players and they showed quality
2273693 but maybe we will see the majority of the players we used in the first half
2273694 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play but the players arent 100 yet that would be difficult right now the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result normally when you have quality when you are playing well and creating chances you will score goals
2273695 it was amazing and it was a surprise for us to see so many people in a red shirt the support for the team here is really good
2273696 olympiakos is a challenge for me i know i will be here for two years
2273697 ive had two weeks of pre season training with liverpool and i believe i will be ready to do whatever i have to olympiakos are a great team who challenge for every honour in greece and in the champions league the team has some good players a well known coach and fanatical supporters which always inspires them
2273698 they are finding players like ngog players with quality who are not a high price
2273699 number two behind the cessna on downwind and hes cleared for the option

2273701 if you are part of a society that votes then do so there may be no candidates and no measures you want to vote for but there are certain to be ones you want to vote against in case of doubt vote against by this rule you will rarely go wrong
2273702 if this is too blind for your taste consult some well meaning fool there is always one around and ask his advice then vote the other way this enables you to be a good citizen if such is your wish without spending the enormous amount of time on it that truly intelligent exercise of franchise requires

2273708 when a government becomes powerful it is destructive extravagant and violent it is an usurper which takes bread from innocent mouths and deprives honorable men of their substance for votes with which to perpetuate itself
2273709 government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force
2273710 in all that people can do for themselves the government ought not to interfere
2273711 the most cogent reason for restricting the interference of government is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power
2273712 as time marches on we see the weakening of geographical forces on the lives and activities of humans the borders we used to draw are being replaced with centers and relationships of relevance
2273713 i wanted revenge against all the people that think being part of the brahmin caste actually means something or is worth mentioning in casual conversation

2273720 we included some non member listings on the new website to deliver value to visitors
2273721 as more users become aware of the site and view it as the go to place for consolidated information on west tampa it will become an effective membership development tool for the chamber as well
2273722 the marketing committee is an enthusiastic group that worked hard on making the site a virtual window into the neighborhood to alert neighbors and others to dining shopping leisure time and business opportunities in west tampa
2273723 not much changed in west tampa for over 50 years

2273725 theres a great little place in west tampa on armenia
2273726 its a rustic tampa gem a 40 year old restaurant where old timers sit around and talk politics
2273727 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
2273728 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
2273729 ill stand out there in the rainstorm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard you have to get the fans out of there we have to be out there but if you give those fans a reason to hang around they will
2273730 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
2273731 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
2273732 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
2273733 this time of year with the playoffs and teams in contention we know its tough
2273734 i dont really want to be here at midnight but thats our job thats what you do when the second rain came it just wasnt going to happen we talked to everybody and then called the game
2273735 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
2273736 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field
2273737 his presence in the lineup means a lot to us in different ways
2273738 we can rest our catcher a little more we can rotate our outfield a little more it gives us a lot of flexibility and when he gets hot it carries us
2273739 throughout the course of the season youre going to do things you didnt think possible both good and bad getting sori back was huge but there was never a doubt wed start hitting again
2273740 anything that was falling off the plate they didnt swing at and anything that was up in the zone or over the plate they pretty much hit
2273741 its about 80 85 percent but its going to be sore for a while so i have to go ahead and go with it
2273742 darin erstad has been outstanding for us and really kind of carried us this week or so when we were short
2273743 michael being out there will give us more flexibility on our bench
2273744 he did his throwing on the side wednesday and seemed to get through that all right
2273745 the trainers think its a mild strain or perhaps some tentativeness on his part for being out there the first time
2273746 this is a place where ive had success in the past so you always have a level of comfort when youve done well in a place
2273747 i dont try to read too much into it i dont look at the schedule and say oh were going to cincinnati im going to get a bunch of hits you just get a good feeling when you go to certain places and this is one of the places i enjoy playing
2273748 i made the turn and looked up and saw all hell was breaking loose at home plate
2273749 new york mets ibanez appeared to be an ideal fit for the mets but they refused to trade left hander jon niese who is close to big league ready or double a outfielder fernando martinez
2273750 mets suck how do i know because mets fans are idiots
2273751 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
2273752 he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
2273753 i dont have a village and i dont have a caste how would a declaration of my caste help dalit consolidation
2273754 there is a difference between an ascribed identity and an acquired one
2273755 in the public sphere you should exude a sense of anxiety because you should have acquired a sense of anxiety along with your modernist suspicion you should not be predictable
2273756 as well as the rest of india are largely obcs as corporates move into agriculture it could only get worse this could well prove to be the upas undoing
2273757 but any unity has to be of a substantive nature
2273758 it has to fuse the aspirations of both dalits and obcs based on principles short term unity for electoral pragmatism wont do it
2273759 the sort kanshi ram did for dalits in the north he would go to villages take out a pen and say it represented the social system he would then show it upside down and say we could reverse the caste order he rhetoricised ambedkarite philosophy with symbols
2273760 is that i thought of the well being of the people i lived amidst the land my father tilled on
2273761 i would have died of hunger had i not been helped by some good folks in delhi
2273762 those who couldnt afford a bicycle now maintain motorcycles wheres the money coming from
2273763 the so called anti naxal salva judum has become a tool for vested business and political interests
2273764 in any case salva judum could have been successful only if it had come from the people rather than the state
2273765 how does it matter they were muslims they had to die they are dead
2273766 in every house today there is a bomb and that bomb is the woman who forms the basis of hindu culture and tradition
2273767 parents allow her to go to college and they start having love affairs often with muslims women should just be kept at home to save them from the terrible fate of hindu muslim marriages
2273768 we beat him in a way that no muslim will dare to look at hindu women again only last week we made a muslim eat his own waste thrice in a spoon
2273769 how does it matter they were muslims they had to die they are dead
2273770 they cannot reduce my hatred for muslims with that can they while in jail i demolished a small mosque that was located in there
2273771 they are all terrorists refuse to sing even the national song why dont they just go to pakistan now our aim is to create a society where we have as little to do with them as possible
2273772 and husbands on their parts because theyre sinners now respond to that threat to their authority either by being abusive which is of course one of the ways men can respond when their authority is challenged or more commonly to become passive acquiescent and simply not asserting the leadership they ought to as men in their homes and in churches
2273773 a woman will demonstrate that she is in fact a christian that she has submitted to gods ways by affirming and embracing her god designed identity as for the most part generally this is true as wife and mother rather than chafing against it rather than bucking against it rather than wanting to be a man wanting to be in a mans position wanting to teach and exercise authority over men
2273774 criticised last year for being anti god and anti religion
2273775 hey i know its a chick hero but look at what you get to ogle if you buy heh heh heh

2273799 radical cause came from the group previously identified as nominal
2273800 religion of peace draws us in particular to the teaching of islam on violent jihad
2273801 there are at least 114 verses in the quran that speak of love peace and forgiveness especially in the surah titled
2273802 sword verses abrogate earlier verses apparently advocating peace and tolerance the nature of this violent teaching can be seen by the following sample
2273803 but when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay those who join other gods with allah wherever you find them besiege them seize them lay in wait for them with every kind of ambush
2273804 make war upon such of those to whom the scriptures have been given as believe not in allah or in the last day and who forbid not what allah and his apostle have forbidden until they pay tribute
2273805 when you encounter the unbelievers strike off their heads until ye have made a great slaughter among them
2273806 unbelievers and fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in allah
2273807 let those who fight in the cause of allah who sell the life of this world for the hereafter to him who fighteth in the cause of allah whether he is slain or gets victory soon shall we give him a reward of great value
2273808 but those who are killed in the way of allah he will never let their deeds be lost and admit them to paradise
2273809 sword texts and that many muslims in britain and across the world are peaceful and law abiding but the issue is does a correct understanding of the quran and the example of muhammad as we know it ultimately require that all muslims believe and support such teaching
2273810 violence in the teaching of the quran and in the example of muhammad himself they usually respond in one of the following ways affirmation as we have seen we could expect 40 of british muslims to affirm all or some quranic teaching on violence
2273811 sword verses ever had any place in historic mainstream islam and that centuries of islamic tradition and authoritative teaching proves that this is the case
2273812 vast body of muslim opinion within mainstream and historic islamic tradition
2273813 moderation on the rest of islam or second sufism is not essentially moderate after all the history of sufi groups such as of naqshbandi qadiri and sanusyia reveals clear signs of a lack of moderation
2273814 natural reading of islamic texts as well as much influential historical interpretation of these provides fuel for the radicals
2273815 the person on the other end does not know you hang up now
2273816 not counting potatoes how many servings of vegetables did you eat this week

2273822 little turd blossom i e bushs brain is leading america to hell
2273823 earlier this month karl rove failed to comply with the judiciary committees subpoena to testify about the mass firings of united states attorneys despite evidence that he played a central role in these firings just as he did in the libby case involving the outing of an undercover cia agent and improper political briefings at over 20 government agencies mr rove acted as if he was above the law that is wrong now that he is leaving the white house while under subpoena i continue to ask what mr rove and others at the white house are so desperate to hide mr roves apparent attempts to manipulate elections and push out prosecutors citing bogus claims of voter fraud shows corruption of federal law enforcement for partisan political purposes and the senate judiciary committee will continue its investigation into this serious issue
2273824 the list of senior white house and justice department officials who have resigned during the course of these congressional investigations continues to grow and today mr rove added his name to that list there is a cloud over this white house and a gathering storm a similar cloud envelopes mr rove even as he leaves the white house
2273825 the story is that she had oral sex with a guy friend of ours last week just for fun theyre not dating although theyve always flirted with each other a lot emma took one look at my face this morning and she knew i knew
2273826 gods definition of sexual purity covers much more than intercourse
2273827 the physical and emotional effects of oral sex are similar to intercourse
2273828 all my friends are wondering if this guy or that guy likes them i dont like any guys right now instead i wonder if i have a crush on sierra shes one of my best friends
2273829 i havent wanted any guy to touch me not even my dad
2273830 i couldnt believe it when i found the box those horrible magazines
2273831 i couldnt even look at my dad after i found it my dads a christian yet hes got this porn stash its like hes got this secret life
2273832 talk with a trusted christian adult about the issue pray together and come up with a plan for what to do next
2273833 you gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince
2273834 youre sitting next to the prom queen in english class
2273835 i was exceptionally shocked when i was previewing the true images bible for our daughter
2273836 it would be very easy to just think that because it contains gods word we can just give it to our kids and let them read it without censorship believe me i nearly did but thank god i did not i send this out as a warning
2273837 i felt very compelled to at least give you all a heads up
2273838 i find this bible comparable to filthy graffiti smeared across the word of god instead of edifying young girls and encouraging them to godliness it actually violates their purity by its very text
2273839 having seven daughters myself i am deeply grieved that parents would encourage their young daughters to read such graphic narratives i would not give this bible to my 20 year old virgin daughter to read much less a 13 year old why should she have images of oral sex lesbianism and rape in her mind
2273840 in putting true images together our guiding principle was to be as edgy as the bible is and no more
2273841 weve forgotten that the bible is filled with sex and violence and gods redemptive role in the lives of sinful people the bible itself is a pretty provocative book
2273842 again and again and again the issues that repeatedly came up were a lot of issues related to sex
2273843 todays teens are just bombarded with highly suggestive highly sexual media messages every day
2273844 these issues are out there and we need to make sure teens have a biblical view of sexuality we felt it would be irresponsible not to address some of these specific issues even oral sex and homosexuality even for 13 year old girls virtually every 13 to 16 year old out there is dealing with these issues
2273845 we want to point them to god centered solutions and responses to the things theyre seeing on tv and the things theyre hearing from their friends
2273846 i really like this bible it made me realize that god does understand what a girl has to go through with everybody parents siblings friends acquaintances boyfriends and temptations
2273847 i truly believe that god has blessed me with this bible to get a better understanding about dating and flirting and about me and my body and i thank you for making the bible that way in that kind of style
2273848 its the parents responsibility to share these things with their children in a protected way it shouldnt come from a teen bible
2273849 and then encouraging relationships where girls can ask questions of parents if an issue comes up it needs to be the parent presenting it in a godly way not in some little story
2273850 not every 13 year old girl needs to be discussing oral sex so why would we put it in a narrative that is almost titillating
2273851 in attempting to instill purity in a child what theyre doing is actually robbing them theyre assaulting their purity because theyre exposing them to way more than they need to be exposed to at that young age
2273852 as much as we as parents want to shield our kids from the world its very difficult to do that even if were doing all we can these issues are going to come up and what better way for them to come up than in the context of a bible
2273853 if the real world of public school exposes them to oral sex pregnant 14 year old friends homosexuality rape fornication etc the answer isnt to talk about it in some hip teen book
2273854 the answer is to protect them which may mean homeschooling them
2273855 be not deceived god is not mocked whatsoever a man sows that and only that is what he shall reap
2273856 they letters are my friends some people look at bottles of wine or whatever girls bottoms i get kicks out of looking at type
2273857 and im pretty sure most of them were her friends and family
2273858 i never thought anybody ever won these things to get the first book its amazing
2273859 this is certainly going to be the biggest book of the year without a doubt
2273860 its great to find a new series we can read and maybe grow old with
2273861 its a completely different story line and a completely different fan base
2273862 but what it does have in common is that its all based on word of mouth
2273863 moms and daughters can read it and have conversations about abstinence
2273864 you didnt hear people saying jon stewart jewish writer when his book came out
2273865 i am passionate about sports be it cricket hockey football or badminton so investing in ipl is for me a way to promote sports as a profitable career option for youngsters in the country today not just a gamble
2273866 for me it will be great to change the lives of youngsters who need to go out and channel their youthful aggression for good purposes rather than putting it to destructive use i think sports is the best option for giving an outlet to the tremendous energy and enthusiasm that the youth possess
2273867 to begin with i wanted to put my money on a popular sport like cricket which is followed like a religion in the country
2273868 frankly speaking i cant afford to invest in ipl but then one cannot shy away from taking a good initiative thinking of it as a gamble
2273869 i was a fairly good sportsman when i joined films infact i started acting in delhi because i injured myself and hence could not follow a cricket or soccer career my love for sports has now led me to train my children in different sporting disciplines
2273870 i feel that if god has given me so much money instead of spending it on comforts e g to buy a plane for myself why not invest it in sports so that a career in sports no longer remains a gamble for youngsters in india
2273871 nothing is decided as yet a technical team will be doing all this for me i do not have so much understanding of technical aspects
2273872 my principle is whether in a lifetime i can make a change for say 70 people by the time i am 70 for me it is important that i can change a few lives in my office and that of a few people who work with me
2273873 if it came from mars they have monkeys on mars
2273874 its a natural laboratory because of its similarities to what we can find on other planets like mars where humans cant go
2273875 i just spent forever stretching this thing i better save it for a masterpiece
2273876 dalits often have five to six kids but they are confident of placing them easily and well
2273877 50 per cent of patel nagars rickshaw pullers are brahmins who like their brethren have moved to the city looking for jobs for lack of employment opportunities and poor education in their villages
2273878 it is particularly welcome among marxists missionaries muslims separatists and christian backed dalit movements of different hues
2273879 with all these hospitals schools etc with his name inscribed on them
2273880 when ever you are going to pen we will be after you
2273881 the author of this article has very little knowledge about the subject he is trying to discuss
2273882 whether you are muslim buddhist sikh jain or parsi your ancestors are all hindus

2273884 i woo the backwards woo the down trodden they have the numbers and unity u are upper caste and have few votes what worth you are to me
2273885 they have lost always they need to win we need more schools more colleges reforms
2273886 if they have to win must we lose is this a zero sum game to not play we may not choose
2273887 coercive criminal activity as legitimate in the total belief system
2273888 men have authority over women because allah has made the one superior to the others and because they spend their wealth to maintain them good women are obedient they guard their unseen parts because allah has guarded them as for those from whom you fear disobedience admonish them and send them to beds apart and beat them then if they obey you take no further action against them allah is high supreme

2273890 i just love it when my baseball team is one of the national laughingstocks like i keep hearing how this team is supposed to have such great offense but were 12th in runs scored in the nl
2273891 all i can say is that either owner drayton mclane is seriously insane and he thinks this lousy team has a snowflakes chance in heck of actually competing for something besides 4th place in the nl or he figures that this is the only way to keep butts in the seats in the ballpark and keep the season ticket sales strong
2273892 me and jake worked on a few little i guess tweaks i hate that word tweak but tweaks
2273893 any time those guys hit home runs youve got a great chance to win
2273894 the ball just explodes out of his hand and even when he throws his changeup his arm just comes at you so fast hes got great stuff
2273895 he didnt have his usual sharpness on his breaking ball and he just could not get out of the fifth inning he left a fastball over the plate to griffey and after that at that point we made it really hard on ourselves
2273896 adam is swinging as good as ive seen him swing since ive been here
2273897 its a relief but we tried to help give it back to them
2273898 i went in the weight room and said im not talking to any other clubs about you i m not trading you you re a houston astro and i m glad to have you here
2273899 we wanted to bring out the real issues that people dont talk about in the open
2273900 so we created an imaginary village named ujjas and gradually it became the most popular program in kutch
2273901 como podem voc s acreditar em mim se o que procuram receber honras uns dos outros e n o as que v m s de deus
2273902 a minha querida esposa como um jardim fechado como uma fonte de quem mais ningu m bebe que s para mim
2273903 i was just finishing my house and when i mean my house i mean my house im doing a man cave of epic proportions
2273904 my collection of crap was getting so big that my wife said
2273905 ravens manor is inspired by disneys haunted mansion ride and also by the legends and folklore of new orleans
2273906 we wanted to tell a classic story of eternal love and the ultimate triumph over good and evil by giving the production a ghostly setting we are able to incorporate our thrilling new act a wall trampoline which allows our gymnasts to somersault in and out of the windows of our two story haunted mansion
2273907 once magnificent estate that is doomed by a terrible curse any daughter of ravens manor who dares to marry for love commits her groom to death at the hands of three malicious spirits
2273908 a cirque du soleil style production drawn from the legends of new orleans with daring dives from the mansion windows of our all new haunted house trampoline act plus a ghostly bride who flies from the attic high above the audience bringing a ghostly tale to frightful life
2273909 nothing is worth more than laughter it is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself to be light tragedy is the most ridiculous thing

2273912 dad can we go see the mountain man to get some berries
2273913 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
2273914 i have found christian dogma unintelligible early in life i absented myself from christian assemblies
2273915 christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man
2273916 during almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of christianity been on trial what has been its fruits more or less in all places pride and indolence in the clergy ignorance and servility in the laity in both superstition bigotry and persecution
2273917 whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon that the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind and for my own part i sincerely detest it as i detest everything that is cruel
2273918 we have abundant reason to rejoice that in this land the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of bigotry and superstition in this enlightened age and in this land of equal liberty it is our boast that a mans religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the laws nor deprive him of the right of attaining and holding the highest offices that are known in the united states
2273919 but i cant see it myself it never crossed my mind that i couldnt handle what had happened i fell in love with martyns cheeky smile and sparkling eyes when i look at him now that is still what i see
2273920 as a condition for her support he promised his wife maria that he wouldnt volunteer for a tour in iraq that he would only go if ordered but martinez broke his promise this year and raised his hand hating that he broke his word but feeling that he could not honorably serve with people doing more than him

2273923 except for all the donkeys who run alongside the riders in the mountains thats got to be pretty hard when youre that drunk
2273924 what other sport allows drunken spectators to yell and spit right in the face of the athletes as they perform nearly inhuman feats of strength and endurance
2273925 two of the happiest days of my life were when lemond beat fignon in 1989 and when landis made his comeback in 2006 two of the saddest were when hamilton got popped in the vuelta and when floyd cracked in the yellow jersey dont even get me started on the giants and niners
2273926 bike racing may be a little hard for some people to appreciate but generally speaking guys like things that go fast and crash a lot and ladies like hairless dudes in tight shorts there is obviously a lot more to it than that but we are talking about americans here
2273927 this is where the future of cycling in america is going to come from people who grew up in the lemond 7 eleven armstrong eras are starting to have lots of kids and many of them have a lot of money to spend would you rather have a child that races bikes or plays football
2273928 i have always been fascinated by the strength of this phenomenon and am certain that much of the lance armstrong effect was purely a result of his dominance in the tour as a proud flag waving american regardless there is a palpable confidence which comes from supporting a winner unless of course you happen to be from france
2273929 focus recklessly lumps all these categories of men under a
2273930 i am proud to support barack obama for president and work hard for his election because we share a commitment to equality for all americans this is our quest and our common goal
2273931 why oh why did the cranky product manager disappear for weeks and weeks and weeks wherever did she go
2273932 some of these anchors go back to the days of sail boats
2273933 i thought they were reasonably safe because the place is so inaccessible you cant drive down there in a car
2273934 the anchors are very large about 6ft in length and very heavy weighing about 150kg each
2273935 as one of the nations first openly gay leaders harvey milk inspired his community to stand strong and proud in the face of adversity
2273936 his leadership and courage embodies the rise of our civil rights movement and his achievements and vision will always be an inspiration for californians of all ages and experiences we are thrilled the legislature has passed this measure recognizing the legacy of harvey milk and the important role he played in our states history
2273937 i just believe in the unique status of marriage as between a man and woman and i know that we have a respectful disagreement on that issue
2273938 i would continue to support a civil union that provides all the benefits to a legally sanctioned marriage
2273939 this feature here is really cool the idea for it came to me while i was vacationing in the cote dazur
2273940 i decided to have my team work on this great feature first next the reason the release is late is because development isnt doing its job
2273941 mortality morbidity bedbug bites can create considerable anxiety and localized and occasionally systemic reactions sometimes if the bite reactions are intensely pruritic scratching with excoriations may be complicated by impetigo bedbugs may be a vector for hepatitis b and in endemic areas for american trypanosomiasis chagas disease anaphylactoid reactions are well described one case of an anaphylactoid reaction occurred in a 41 year old businessman in a first class urban hotel in america
2273942 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
2273943 latroy gives us another experienced quality arm for our bullpen
2273944 we tried to sign him during the offseason and lost out to the yankees but we are happy to have him here for the remainder of the season he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
2273945 it was one of those things where if i ever got the chance to play for the yankees i certainly didnt want to pass up on that opportunity
2273946 no disrespect to the astros or anything like that but it was one of those things that i wanted to do at one point in my career and the opportunity presented itself
2273947 we ended up getting a deal done for an experienced relief pitcher who we think can go back on the back end and help brocail and sampson and the other guys who weve been using late and help us get the job done
2273948 i told myself that i was going to stay in shape
2273949 if i got traded i got traded or if i had to wait the full 10 days and get released and then sign with another team that was the way i was going to go i just wanted the chance to pitch again this year
2273950 he seemed very pleased with the opportunity hes going to get here

2273979 the cobra is a good enough nickname for now maybe after a few more glorious victories in which i hypnotize the competition with my reptilian stare the other riders and media will begin to refer to me as cobra commander anyway in fact i am certain they will cobra

2274133 i got reservations because i was dalit but in each case i more than deserved the post
2274134 dalits are deliberately discriminated against and excluded and we need reservations to make sure they get their due
2274135 but there may sometimes have been an implicit bias you can never tell why do you think so many thousands of reserved seats are vacant in space research you can say candidate not found but how can you say that about clerical jobs

2274137 but at the moment the demand for the exclusion of the creamy layer seems to come from those who want to further exclude dalits

2274142 do you think they could have happened without dalits entering the mainstream through reservations
2274143 once you enter the system there is horizontal and vertical mobility the higher you go the less caste will matter
2274144 i have fought for obc reservations since 1991 economically obcs are the intermediate castes but are socially and educationally backward
2274145 does that mean non obcs are not in conflict with dalits

2274546 habermas insists that there is a distinction to be drawn between those who subject the enlightenment to critical scrutiny from within it and those who attempt to step outside of the enlightenment by positing some standpoint that does not itself fall back into an enlightenment problematic
2274547 on the other hand what i have absorbed or accepted is the thought that the enlightenment not only can but must be criticized from within the resources that are made possible by the enlightenment itself this is not to say that the enlightenment owns a monopoly on critical self reflection rather that the enlightenment can be read as a cipher for the attempt to democratize critical reflection

2274575 aku telah melihat sebagian kitab ini tetapi hatiku tidak tentram untuk berpegang dengannya sehingga aku tidak me riwayatkan apa yang ada di dalamnya kecuali kisah kisah yang telah masyhur dan terkenal dari selain kitab ini karena kitab ini banyak berisi riwayat dari orang orang yang tidak dikenal juga terdapat perkara perkara yang jauh dari agama dan dakwaan dakwaan dan perkataan yang batil tidak berbatas seperti kisah syeikh abdul qadir menghidupkan ayam yang telah mati dan sebagainya semua itu tidak pantas dinisbatkan kepada syeikh abdul qadir al jailani rahimahullah
2274576 syeikh abdul qadir al jailani rahimahullah memiliki pemahaman yang bagus dalam masalah tauhid sifat sifat allah takdir dan ilmu ilmu marifat yang sesuai dengan sunnah
2274577 dia allah di arah atas berada di atas arsy nya meliputi seluruh kerajaan nya ilmu nya meliputi segala sesuatu

2274581 intinya syeikh abdul qadir memiliki kedudukan yang agung tetapi terdapat kritikan kritikan terhadap sebagian perkataannya dan allah menjanjikan ampunan atas kesalahan kesalahan orang beriman namun sebagian perkataannya merupakan kedustaan atas nama beliau
2274582 tidak ada seorangpun para kibar masyayikh yang riwayat hidup dan karamahnya lebih banyak kisah hikayat kecuali syeikh abdul qadir al jailani dan banyak di antara riwayat riwayat itu yang tidak benar bahkan ada yang mustahil terjadi
2274583 aku telah mendapatkan aqidah beliau syeikh abdul qadir al jailani di dalam kitabnya yang bernama al ghunyah lihat kitab al ghunyah i 83 94 dan aku mengetahui bahwa dia sebagai seorang salafi beliau menetapkan nama nama dan sifat sifat allah dan aqidah aqidah lainnya di atas manhaj salaf beliau juga membantah kelompok kelompok salimiyah dan kelompok lainnya dengan manhaj salaf

2274604 the rush is away from it the young folks think that they must go to town as soon as they are grown everyone wonders why and how cousin anns three boys have stayed on farms
2274605 that one reason of that restless haste to leave the farm is owing to a neglect of making the farm and the farmhouse attractive
2274606 a great many people pile all the agreeable things they have into one or two rooms which they keep shut up for apocryphal visitors the family sitting room and the bedrooms are bare and forbidding
2274607 the young folks go to visit their neighbors or out into the streets and look at the store windows and so try to compensate themselves whether they know what they want or not all youth craves beauty it is a natural desire
2274608 that young folks should not find what they crave in the safety of their own homes what an anchorage for good faith and virtue is the love of an honest pure home what a stay to a child in all his life the memory of a home beautiful upright and loving and by beautiful i do not mean the beauty which is created by money in velvet carpets rosewood furniture fine ornaments and pictures those are all very well when they fall to our lot but the beauty which i mean can be created anywhere and out of almost anything by simple good taste i think that care to make the home attractive is the secret of the farming tastes of cousin anns boys and what a comfort those tastes have been to their parents reed and fred are on farms beside their fathers dick is with his father and little jack is not likely to wish to go away what an anxieties have they all been spared what temptations what losses by these home tastes
2274609 when reuben and cousin ann as young married people moved to that farm i use to think it was the barest looking place on earth an old broken down fence no paths no porch no shade no garden there was the land the barns and sheds a straight wooden house and some field fences they moved there in the fall cousin reuben as we all call him now spent a good deal of time that winter in his woodlot cutting and hauling wood for himself and for sale and on top of his loads we school boys saw him bringing home all manner of queer looking and shaped sticks the old yard fence was turned into kindling wood i remember how that place changed not by money outlay for they had a mortgage to pay off but by constant industry and good sense cousin reuben and ann worked away at that front yard and around the house every summer evening for years those queer sticks grew in two years into a handsome rustic fence reuben built with his own hands a porch an arbor and a summer house in the winter evenings he made bird houses and poles for creepers cousin ann got slips cuttings and seeds to give her a bit of good shrubbery was to give her a treasure and reuben carried from the field and wood promising young shade and ornamental trees look what a place they have now

2274738 it kind of just snowballed on him in the fifth inning
2274739 he got to two outs and was one pitch away and then blum hits a three run homer
2274740 i kept trying to make pitches and i wasnt really getting them where i wanted them to
2274741 quite frankly i was lucky to not give up nine runs with what i had going on
2274742 what in the hell did i just get myself into
2274743 it really is pretty incredible to make up five games this quickly
2274744 i think everybody wants to be up there late in the ballgame and have a chance to do something big for your team
2274745 in that situation i am just trying to get corey to third because its a big run for us i was just trying to hit a ground ball to second base and ended up hitting the bottom half of the ball for it to be a single
2274746 im pretty happy with what i did but its all washed away because of the loss
2274747 i wish we would have chipped in with another run or two we had some chances to really break the game open
2274748 my focus and you can focus on it all you want was to be within striking distance of the cubs when they came to town somehow find a way to get within a couple of games and we have accomplished that right now
2274749 business is not the same as it used to be
2274750 im told you charge as much as 1 200 for stitching a blouse
2274751 i charge that to people who are willing to pay
2274752 websites promoting hate content slander or defamation of others promoting gambling promoting racism violence and terrorism and other such material in addition to promoting pornography including child pornography and violent sex can easily be blocked since all such websites may not claim constitutional right of free speech blocking of such websites may be equated to balanced flow of information and not censorship
2274753 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
2274754 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
2274755 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
2274756 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
2274757 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
2274758 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure

2274764 we have moved from being a small insignificant and neutral country without any military importance to being considered an extremely active participant in a more militant western world
2274765 things have gotten out of control we must discuss whether we have to constantly get involved in places where we are most hated
2274766 the government knows that we are driving on the edge and will have to slow down
2274767 israeli on arab tv jlem was ours when moslems worshipped idols
2274768 jews were in jerusalem while your ancestors were drinking wine and blowing to idols
2274769 building in jerusalem is another nail in the coffin in negotiations with the palestinian authority
2274770 this was our capital 3 000 years ago and we were here when your forefathers were drinking wine burying girls alive and worshipping pre muslim idols this is our city and it will be our city forever
2274771 if you want to talk about history you cannot erase jerusalem from the koran and dont attack the muslim religion if we want to continue talking
2274772 jerusalem is not mentioned even once in the koran jerusalem is a jewish city
2274773 jerusalem is not mentioned in the koran even once you cant rewrite the koran on air on al jazeera
2274774 jerusalem will include all of the west bank judea and samaria
2274775 my friend israel is not counting the number of apartments that qatar is building on the qatar peninsula so why are you doing so in jerusalem
2274776 why are some types of footwear better than others for walking on ice

2274781 the short answer is ethanol is both good and bad for the environment
2274782 the benefits are that ethanol does reduce carbon monoxide when used in the winter time
2274783 we are more concerned about solving the smog problem than about solving the carbon monoxide problem
2274784 this will mean dirtier air and price hikes at the pumps in california
2274785 thus the use of ethanol plays an important role in smog reduction

2274842 man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god
2274843 all scripture is given by inspiration of god doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work
2274844 for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god
2274845 the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath therefore the son of man is also lord of the sabbath
2274846 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
2274847 then god said let us make man in our image according to our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
2274848 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had done and he rested then god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it he rested from all his work which god had created and made
2274849 the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for
2274850 now on the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread i e eat a meal paul ready to depart the next day spoke to them and continued his message until midnight
2274851 on the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside storing up as he may prosper that there be no collections when i come
2274852 i lords day and i heard behind me a loud voice as of a trumpet
2274853 the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord your god
2274854 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven does the will of my father in heaven
2274855 indeed if carlstadt one of the few that argued against sunday observance were to write further about the sabbath sunday would have to give way and the sabbath that is to say saturday must be kept holy
2274856 to avoid the unnecessary disturbance which an innovation would occasion the worship day should continue to be sunday
2274857 the protestant world at its birth found the christian sabbath sunday too strongly entrenched to run counter to its existence it was therefore placed under the necessity of acquiescing in the arrangement thus implying the churchs right to change the day for over 300 years the christian sabbath sunday is therefore to this day the acknowledged offspring of the catholic church without a word of protest from the protestant world

2274900 you are so lucky to live in this awesome neighborhood
2274901 i agree that it is a fantastic neighborhood but i am not lucky to live here i chose to live here

2274919 there are 600 microbreweries in the uk and 35 family brewers this sector of the market is very active
2274920 there are the supermarkets selling alcohol very cheaply while in the pubs it is relatively expensive and you can no longer smoke
2274921 then you have got an economic situation with everybody having to adapt to the lack of credit and spending power and a government which is upping the duty on alcohol and making it the new tobacco in terms of the damage they say it is causing to our health
2274922 it has provenance it can be organic it can be green it can be local all things that people are looking for these days
2274923 so for pubs its something that looks good to have on your bars and it can drive traffic
2274924 it fits in with the pressure that they are under to offer variety and to be more local
2274925 the market might be getting quieter overall but weve not noticed a downturn in business at all
2274926 there are pubs closing which is worrying but it tends to be the less well run pubs that do shut
2274927 and while the supermarkets sell drink cheaply its a different market if somebody wants a nice ale perhaps something different they will seek it out in a pub
2274928 its something different and people like the concept but it has to taste good
2274929 nobody is going to buy a beer just because it is organic it has to be organic and also be really nice
2274930 when magners advertise they dont just advertise magners they advertise cider and that has been great for us
2274931 certainly the cider producers that i know are not complaining about falling sales what we dont know yet is what effect any recession will have
2274932 i just called suppliers and asked them to get whatever they had onto lorries and driven up to london straight away we sorted out the invoices after it had all been drunk
2274933 it would be wrong to suggest that the market conditions over the foreseeable future will be anything other than tough
2274934 that means that we must remain very vigilant to managing risk
2274935 more or less every analyst on the planet expected barcap to be the pre eminent credit crunch victim
2274936 but to date barcap has not suffered credit losses anywhere near as big as merrill or ubs or even royal bank of scotland
2274937 due to expected market conditions accurate earnings predictions especially for banking are not feasible

2274939 the corporate structure is very complex but is designed to facilitate fundraising and the ultimate management of the home
2274940 the friends of the jesse james farm one of their main tasks is to help fundraise to find particular items that perhaps the organization itself or the home itself cant fund and so they do do fundraising in order to create gifts for the organization or for the farm itself
2274941 we anticipate youll see some of that very same thing with our friends organization as well

2274989 i was in my swimsuit and in the water and
2274990 i hope i still rock like him when im that old
2274991 i heard this coaster has a first drop over 160 feet and can go almost 70 mph
2274992 i dont think choosing the first car was such a good idea
2274993 look what they have done to me did u see it mummy
2274994 he got gassed he looked a lot faster than everybody else to begin with but he got tired very quick
2274995 we just got to get him going its an easy call for us because he understands what were doing and he knows the system so he can walk out here and go today hes got some talent there is an opportunity for him as we get chris brown healthy well just see how it goes
2274996 i was super nervous it was like going back to the combine
2274997 you have to try to impress some people you have guys watching and you just have to do your best i just know the average nfl players career is not that long so i have to do the best that i can when i get my opportunities
2274998 its part of camp youre always going to have things to deal with but for him to help his football team he has to be on the field
2274999 i would sure hope hes back today he is already a day behind and needs to get back out here
2275000 a lot of the guys up there in new england used to say all the time when id drop back in coverage keep that guy going forward
2275001 well have to see how he fits in what were doing and how were using him
2275002 we have to be smart hes not a big enough guy endwise to play down in and down out well have to pick our spots so i think its up to us coaches to find his niche
2275003 its a different situation as far as how i line up and learning different techniques
2275004 i hope its not as big of a transition as some people are expecting
2275005 its been mixed in here and there it shouldnt be that big a deal but i got a lot of work to do
2275006 you want them around guys that have great work ethic take care of themselves and love the game if theyre looking up to those type people theyre probably going to end up like that
2275007 the fact that he comes from championship teams gives him a lot of credibility with our guys and hes doing a good job
2275008 we got it done early this morning but it took some time for him to sign and stuff
2275009 hes the only guy ive ever seen sign a contract with his ankles taped but we got him out here and we had a portion of the practice with him it was a great job by gm rick smith and director of football administration chris olsen you know they got all those guys signed
2275010 we agreed sometime around maybe 6 15 in the morning and this thing started yesterday afternoon in earnest so relief was the biggest thing
2275011 hes a great kid and hes managed to take his skill and expertise to a new level nothing would surprise me hes a very accountable kid
2275012 last year is last year im looking for bigger and better things this year im competing my butt off and im working hard each day and im looking for better things than last year
2275013 this is the second year with matt schaub and obviously our chemistry is good on the field
2275014 hes gotten back and hes really gotten stronger and hes 100 percent and andre johnson is 100 percent we got an awful lot weapons out there so well be even better
2275015 he reminds me of a kid who played for me a long time ed mccaffrey
2275016 he reminds me of him a great deal what happens to guys like that who people say is like this or like that they find a way to make up for it kevin in his career has become such a technician at what he does that if hes like a tenth of a second slower here or there speedwise hell find a way to make it up
2275017 you have to let them know you believe in them
2275018 and it just wasnt me it was our whole team everybody was feeling the type of player he was
2275019 i feel im ready right now but in reality im not ready so ive just got to keep working to even be sitting here talking about being ready is a good situation
2275020 our plan all along is that were expecting him back at midseason
2275021 our football team is looking very forward to that hes been doing a great job with his rehab hes come a long long way
2275022 ive come a long way in this thing so i dont want to rush back
2275023 ive worked way too hard to come out here and get injured again
2275024 every year since i was seven years old ive been out on the football field
2275025 so to be sitting on the sideline watching its tough but i know what i got to get done to get back on the field and thats what i let drive me
2275026 i just felt it tighten up real tight on me when i felt that i just slowed down ill get treatment for a few days and ill be fine
2275027 well get in there and get him looked at and well keep our fingers crossed and hopefully its nothing
2275028 i knew id be able to run around out here this morning just taking those shots i feel like i did fine
2275029 you dont know until you start taking hits how its really going to react
2275030 no issues no flare up it didnt bother me at all
2275031 as long as were winning everybodys going to be happy with whatever role they have
2275032 ive played in running back by committee roles before whoever gets hot thats who its going to be
2275033 my dream since i was a little kid was to be an nfl player
2275034 so it felt very good to sign my contract with the texans and concentrate on just football now
2275035 you know i dont watch tv or read newspapers or magazines
2275036 i dont have to know that im just here to play ball and be part of the team
2275037 he finished the year strong which i think means more confidence and in turn i think hes going to have more success than he had a year ago im not just talking about sacks im talking about hurries on the quarterback and disruptive plays
2275038 the only thing i think about in the past is that it wasnt good enough no matter what i did
2275039 so i dont dwell on it so i just try to go out and be better than what i thought i was before
2275040 what weve also got to do is develop another rusher opposite of him so they cant have that
2275041 thats something im not going to say oh our division is so tough its not fair for us
2275042 no matter who we play weve got to do better thats it
2275043 i dont have to prove nothing to nobody except my teammates
2275044 as long as i know my guys are behind me im behind my all that matters
2275045 you are who you think you are and i think hes going to have a much better year than a year ago
2275046 duane got a little gassed but hes got to catch up with the football team
2275047 hes a little overweight he had a lot going on with the contract and all that so hes got to catch up
2275048 the first few days before camp i think he sat in the sauna for four days straight and i asked him what are you doing here he said trying to get down and i think we settled on what he should be he has done pretty good hes pretty well conditioned for as big of a person he is
2275049 he cant cook i cook i can barbecue cook maybe he can do some bakery type stuff make a pie or something
2275050 if you dont want that if you dont think you have that then youre in the wrong business because theyll run you out of here
2275051 the game is too hard thats definitely my goal and definitely my mind set and i think i have the ability to do it
2275052 hes pretty good dont get me wrong there but theres another level for frank weve got to keep pushing
2275053 my main goal that i want to take pride in is helping the team stop the run
2275054 i think if we can slow teams down in the run game it can definitely help us in the long run
2275055 the woman in the photos is one of the wives of his band members
2275056 to take a break from the tour it was a reward for them to get away and his way of saying thanks for all their hard work

2275071 very well then i think well go there today i wouldnt mind having a look at the nagar castle and the roerich art gallery
2275072 theres this village close by with a lot of foreigners
2275073 they say that its at manikaran right next to the gurudwara he said after consulting them
2275074 not that one theres one here in this godforsaken place
2275075 they say that there is a small temple down below close to the river
2275076 he says that you are the first foreigner hes seen in years he doesnt go to the village anymore and the only people who visit the temple are the locals
2275077 this person you were looking for madam anybody close to you
2275078 i wasnt looking for anybody its just that i wanted to see that temple
2275079 i need to tell you im a married man with two kids
2275080 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2275081 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2275082 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2275083 your mind just races with all we could do and it is just so exciting for us
2275084 will we have a show like that no will we have a show thats wholly canadian of course it will and it will inspire the world
2275085 but also if they can do that then i can do something as creative
2275086 the things were planning to do are on track and judging from what ive heard about the timing for beijing and where they were at certain times were in good shape
2275087 its not going to be a mad rush at the end
2275088 it reminds us that the next time our olympic athletes take part in the opening ceremony and the next time the drama of the olympic cauldron lighting stirs everyones hearts as it did tonight it will be at home in 2010

2275090 the regime of bashar seems incompatible with security and peace
2275091 thats about it nothing really major ill go in and get some treatment over the next two days and ill be fine i didnt tear anything or anything like that its hot out here sometimes those things happen you have little tweaks and stuff like that other than that im fine its no big deal i didnt tear anything i slowed down actually when i felt it tighten up on me that was a good thing other than that i dont think it will be a problem

2275093 i guess you can say the cpu scheduler is a steamroller that we as desktop users use to crack nuts with and they didnt want us to build a nutcracker into the kernel
2275094 if there is any one big problem with kernel development and linux it is the complete disconnection of the development process from normal users you know the ones who constitute 99 9 of the linux user base
2275095 the linux kernel mailing list is the way to communicate with the kernel developers to put it mildly the linux kernel mailing list lkml is about as scary a communication forum as they come most people are absolutely terrified of mailing the list lest they get flamed for their inexperience an inappropriate bug report being stupid or whatever and for the most part theyre absolutely right there is no friendly way to communicate normal users issues that are kernel related yes of course the kernel developers are fun loving happy go lucky friendly people just look at any interview with linus and see how he views himself
2275096 i think the kernel developers at large havent got the faintest idea just how big the problems in userspace are it is a very small brave minority that are happy to post to lkml and i keep getting users telling me on irc in person and via my own mailing list what their problems are and theyve even become fearful of me even though ive never viewed myself as a real kernel developer

2275110 getting situation data into the head of the busy warfighter
2275111 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2275112 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2275113 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2275114 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
2275115 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2275116 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 m p h it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2275117 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2275118 it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where its coming from
2275119 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2275120 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2275121 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2275122 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2275123 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2275124 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2275125 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2275126 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2275127 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2275128 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes
2275129 but i would say most of the races we have worked together and those were where we had our best races thats constantly a challenge obviously you have four drivers that want to win sometimes youve got to remind them that if they all work together that all four can get better
2275130 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2275131 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2275135 george had a toy tomahawk it was a tiny one he took it along when he played indian he also had a tepee an indian tent
2275136 i know how bad the aggies wanted him and sherman wanted him but i know that johnny likes the city of houston and is excited about what were doing and the guys that hes working with im lucky i didnt lose him hes been a wanted man and especially by a amp m here this past offseason
2275137 that was a really difficult decision for me and my family to make
2275138 i love a amp m i bleed maroon i always said that if there is a college i want to coach at it is a amp m
2275139 the one thing that made it difficult was i love being here with kubiak i believe in what he is doing here i like the type of coach he is and i like working with him and i made a commitment to him when i came here and i believe we are going to win here
2275140 everything stems down from him i feel fortunate to have a coach like johnny hes always positive but at the same time he knows how to motivate you
2275141 its tough for someone to always be positive all the time and still know how to motivate you we all know during this game not everything is going to be positive theres going to be some negatives to be able to stay positive all the time i just want to commend him for that i know that its all about his upbringing and what type of person and human being he is he just makes you want to do better because you have a coach like johnny holland
2275142 that job is a multi tasking job and johnny can do that hes a very smart guy
2275143 any player going down but a guy like him getting hurt its part of football unfortunately and theres not a play that you dont hold your breath in all honesty you just got to keep pushing through and hope for the best and hopefully its our time to stay healthy weve been pretty fortunate through this camp weve been pretty darn good keep our fingers crossed with him and see what happens
2275144 normally when you have a pull or something you can tell when youre running by the way it feels
2275145 i didnt feel anything pop or anything like that i just felt it tighten up real tight on me when i felt that i just slowed down i didnt feel a pop or anything like that afterward so like i said im fine ill get treatment for a few days and ill be fine
2275146 to be honest with you hes not in the shape the rest of our football team is and we found that out real fast
2275147 he got gassed the first night he was out here he got gassed earlier today and hes not up with our team unfortunately thats what happens when you bring guys in the middle of camp or stuff if theyre not in excellent shape they get exposed in a way very very quick i just dont think he was in very good condition
2275148 what we have to do is weve got to prepare that if we suit seven who are those seven
2275149 so were getting g mike brisiel some work at center because that could always be an option of course eslinger to me is really an improved player so well see how it pans out
2275150 for the players when you walk in camp its a long time before you actually get to walk into a stadium and play but now there is a little light at the end of the tunnel each week
2275151 we just hope we get a few of these kids back next week and get healthy and get ready to play next weekend
2275152 i wont rule out the possibility that i may work in this company again in the future
2275153 our goal is to become a playoff team and were going to have to be able to step to the plate against teams week in and week out and play good football if we expect to do that
2275154 mario was a different player last season i dont know if it being his second year in the league was the difference or if it was because he was healthy but whatever the reason he was a different player and a much better player
2275155 you could see on film he was more sure of himself much more confident
2275156 hes such an incredible physical specimen hes tall hes got long arms he gets off the ball fast hes developing a couple of moves but he needs to perfect them he should also develop a couple more sometimes he will let up on a play when hes beaten especially on a bull rush or if the tackle takes him to the outside
2275157 we kind of saw that there was a clear market inefficiency
2275158 the farmer would decide which market to travel to then would just sell to that market so there was no competition between markets

2275162 pat myers and i were best friends in high school and still are
2275163 pat and i talk two to three times a week nick who just took over at ohio state has been instrumental in me getting into coaching and i talk with him weekly i was in his wedding two summers ago if that helps to define how close we all are its nuts that three guys from little kennebunk have all made it to this level of division i athletics go figure
2275164 so much credit is owed to our high school coaches mine specifically being joe rafferty for football don hill and dustin black for hockey and charlie burch for lacrosse its very rare to see kids from one town who have experiences under these coaches to make it to the intercollegiate coaching level and there are a bunch more other than the myers brothers and myself it goes to show how good of a job they do preparing the student athletes for the next level and that is tough to come by these days which i have learned the past few years in the recruiting process they deserve a lot of credit for that and kennebunk is fortunate to have great coaches across the board in most sports

2275192 im not being invited to do these things because of my looks or my facility with language what theyre after is the thing youre saying i have to trade off

2275201 working under mike pressler has been an outstanding opportunity my role as the defensive and recruiting coordinator will certainly allow me to learn how to be successful at the highest level to prepare myself to make that move when the right opportunity comes along there is no question that the move to division i puts bryant mens lacrosse on the map nationally being a part of the transition that is happening right now is as good an opportunity a young coach could ask for combine that with working under arguably one of the most respected and accomplished coaches in the sport of lacrosse is an unreal opportunity
2275202 growing up you cant imagine not playing in the nba but things are changing really fast around the world
2275203 can i imagine leaving the nba yes its a possibility
2275204 it has certainly been one of the hot topics of our training camp over the last few weeks confirmed jason kidd the us teams point guard when asked if he could foresee a time when the best american born players would forsake their homeland
2275205 the rest of the world is getting better at basketball and the money is there that is why we have already seen some guys make the move overseas
2275206 i am sure there is a team that would be willing to do it pay james 50m a year that just shows that the game of basketball is global now and not just about the us hopefully we would be on the same team childress said
2275207 i dont want to say it is much ado about nothing but its not something we are losing sleep about he said although he might feel a little less confident today after james remarks not to mention those of us team members dwayne wade and carlos boozer
2275208 when you see josh childress getting all that money it makes you think said wade who plays for the miami heat

2275213 i hope you hang yourself with your h amp m scarf while jacking off listening to mozart
2275214 i dont think shes being homophobic i think she might be a bit dumb a bit un self aware the kind of behaviour you get from some privileged people oh i didnt realise perhaps she doesnt know any gay people who have suffered verbal or physical abuse
2275215 theyre not seriously homophobic but they can be read as implicitly demeaning gay people i am sure katy would get a critical reception if she expressed comparable sentiments in a song called ur so black jewish or disabled should there be different standards for lyrics about gay issues as opposed to race and disability issues i dont think so having said this the homophobia of some reggae rap and ragga music is far worse some of these songs explicitly incite the murder of lesbians and gays they are much more offensive than any lyrics sung by katy perry
2275216 the lyrics are slightly demeaning to gay people but it validates the reality of a lot of gay peoples lives
2275217 sometimes that degree of honesty is no bad thing and thats not for one moment to be taken as saying its acceptable for some of the more extreme rappers to justify themselves
2275218 i have to do what i think is right for america but i want to add very quickly i understand the pain people are going through i understand the challenges
2275219 i take stands on principle and i dont switch positions depending on what audience or what time it is in the electoral calendar
2275220 for me to give up my advocacy of free trade would be a betrayal of trust i think the most precious commodity i have with the american people is that they trust me

2275233 you cant criticize awarding the olympic games to china just because their rapacious coal building policy has now made them the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions by that standard america should never have been awarded the games but awarding the games to a city that is one of the most polluted in the world let alone in a country that has such a shameful record on human rights is simply unconscionable and quite unfair to the athletes consider this literally staggering story from the newshour

2275255 it was my hope that my book would be a bridge builder develop empathy for this other culture that we know so little about in this country

2275319 inflated pride the fusion of years of nationalistic propaganda with the economic powerhouse china has become has created a feeling that its now the centre of the world and that foreigners come to them with begging hands

2275321 but slowly especially in this last year theres been a change of mood and many people are beginning to feel as though they are pawns in a huge game that their lives have actually become less free more restricted theres this great feeling of nervousness
2275322 a country that relies on police on the military to retain control will find that in such a situation any underlying discontent will burst out
2275323 the government said this is nothing to do with the olympics but there is a feeling that there is some organised effort to make a stand
2275324 i feel that the general mood in the country is that theyre waiting theres almost an expectation of some sinister event and its not just the people who are feeling nervous its the whole nation including the authorities theres almost this feeling of impending doom you go on to the tube in beijing and youre checked as thoroughly as if youre boarding a plane tiananmen square that vast supposedly public plaza is riddled with plainclothes policemen who check your shoes and bags so one has to ask oneself what has this event given to china it was supposed to bring china into the west but all it has achieved is the demolition of great swathes of traditional chinese life all thats left now is the communist party and possibly 80 national leaders attending the opening ceremony and a few sportsmen fighting over gold medals

2275474 bolivia deja de ser mendigo y pasa a ser un estado con dignidad
2275475 no es plata de evo morales ni de los prefectos

2275478 no tengo ning n miedo al pueblo boliviano tampoco tengo miedo al imperio pero algunos no quieren someterse al pueblo s lo quieren someterse al imperio
2275479 el nico instrumento fiel del imperialismo internacional y servidor sumiso del presidente de venezuela hugo ch vez es evo morales
2275480 hasta que el gobierno nos devuelva los fondos del idh
2275481 para no dar motivos a un eventual enfrentamiento entre bolivianos que podr a terminar con graves consecuencias

2275484 el problema que tiene nuestro presidente evo morales es que no lo quieren en los departamentos de beni tarija y santa cruz pero resulta que morales ha realizado muchas obras mejor que otros presidentes y los que echan a perder las cosas son por intereses pol ticos
2275485 estoy de acuerdo que siga evo porque en los tantos a os de vida que tiene bolivia muchos hemos tenido que emigrar y ac nos han acogido muy bien y ahora vemos que l est sacando adelante el pa s
2275486 mucha gente que jam s hab a agarrado un tel fono o luz ahora lo tienen y soy feliz que mi gente progrese por eso voy a viajar a bolivia a darle mi voto
2275487 siento harto que bolivia en estos momentos est en una lucha entre hermanos porque al asumir morales se abri un problema como dividi ndose y no se ve una soluci n
2275488 la medialuna es la parte opositora que no est dejando gobernar al presidente elegido democr ticamente
2275489 espero que el domingo el pueblo tome conciencia de los cambios para los pueblos ind genas y nos vaya bien
2275490 para el prd el refer ndum del pr ximo domingo 10 de agosto tiene una gran importancia ya que el xito de este proceso propiciar mayor estabilidad en ese pa s y en la regi n sudamericana pues es una salida democr tica y constitucional a los conflictos que se han presentado en bolivia
2275491 lndudablemente el referendo revocatorio que se llevar a cabo este domingo 10 de agosto en la rep blica de bolivia es un hecho in dito en la historia democr tica de este pa s suramericano a trav s del cual el pueblo decidir si el presidente evo morales el vicepresidente de la rep blica y ocho prefectos pueden continuar o no en el cargo que el mismo pueblo les asign a os atr s
2275492 esta actitud de morales es la respuesta al ataque abierto que ejercieron los sectores oligarcas y la embajada de estados unidos en su pa s l mismo ha destacado que su gesti n siempre se regir por acciones democr ticas reales ejercidas en las urnas donde el pueblo puede hablar a trav s del voto
2275493 en principio los prefectos adversos al gobierno presionaron a favor del referendo creyendo en encuestas de ciertos organismo internacionales que aseguraban un rechazo rotundo del pueblo boliviano contra evo morales sin embargo ahora reconocen el amplio favoritismo del presidente y en los ltimos d as han presionado a favor de la cancelaci n del proceso
2275494 las exigencias econ micas de los prefectos discapacitados y de la cob son reales sin embargo su verdadera intenci n es conectar todos estos hechos a fin de originar una bien llamada guarimba que conlleve a la suspensi n del referendo
2275495 a pesar de esta norma legal morales expres que de usar ese poder lo har s lo para nombrar a un prefecto de manera provisional mientras se organiza un nuevo proceso electoral adelantado a trav s del cual el pueblo pueda elegir nuevamente al candidato de su preferencia
2275496 el pueblo boliviano al igual que el venezolano posee una gran paciencia y confianza en su gobierno por eso estoy seguro que los grupos de ultraderecha no podr n derrotar la fe de los bolivianos aun con el financiamiento de los estados unidos
2275497 cuente bolivia con que tendr un s lido aliado tendr un impulso y una mano amiga para la soluci n de sus problemas sociales internos y sus demandas internacionales en lo que tambi n podamos ayudar
2275498 utilizando medios distintos el futuro dir qui n puede solucionar m s prontamente la justicia social y el avance en los hogares pues la circunstancia pone una ecuaci n dif cil de equilibrar entre la inversi n y la distribuci n social
2275499 siempre y cuando tambi n los inversionistas respeten las normas y derechos de nuestros pueblos
2275500 estamos muy agradecidos por su visita y hubi ramos reclamado mayores horas
2275501 si fuera as cada a o vendr a a lima
2275502 se hicieron cambios que fortalecieron las estructuras de nuestro estado a fin de dar asistencia social efectiva
2275503 mucho menos complicados de lo que nos muestra la tele que pareciera que todo est en llamas y que est ardiendo el pa s
2275504 el pa s no est ardiendo los que est n ardiendo y est n muy asustados son los grupos privilegiados que en buena medida tienen la culpa de que hoy estemos ac viviendo en la argentina y tuvimos que salir de bolivia con una mano adelante y con otra atr s y emprender el dificil simo camino que es desarraigarse y radicarse en otro lugar
2275505 los grupos que se est n oponiendo a las intenciones del presidente evo morales de hacer un pa s m s justo lo que quiere l es que se termine la injusticia en bolivia pero el peque o grupo de privilegiados no m s de 18 o 20 familias controla todo incluso los medios de comunicaci n y es el que se opone a que los indios y pobres tengan una oportunidad
2275506 est n llevando adelante una pol tica de brazos abiertos
2275507 nunca pude sacar nunca el dni ni radicarme en la argentina que era muy complicado despu s de cinco a os desist dije no me radico ni tengo dni y cada tres meses ten a que presentarme en la polic a firmar un libro y decir que segu aviviendo en la argentina y as es muy dif cil
2275508 lamentablemente muchos hermanos cayeron en la trampa de gestores que les cobraron entre 600 y 1
2275509 hoy gracias a dios y a la generosidad de la presidenta cristina y n stor kirchner todos los hermanos que vivimos ac de manera sencilla podemos tener nuestra radicaci n y nuestros documentos es una oportunidad fant stica que tenemos que aprovechar
2275510 antes costaban entre 50 y 60 d lares hoy solo 9 50 pesos y es ese el valor que hay que pagar para tener los certificados de nacimiento antecedentes policiales y de nacionalidad
2275511 hemos venido a trabajar a la argentina no a robar ni delinquir sino a trabajar de manera honesta y sacrificada y por eso es importante completar todos los c rculos y ponernos en regla tener nuestros documentos ya que con stos vamos a poder votar que no significa necesariamente entrar en el juego pol tico no no sino que cuando tu votas los pol ticos se acuerden de ti
2275512 es muy importante que vengan al consulado que tengan confianza pero s que no es f cil porque personalmente tuve la peor impresi n del consulado porque las tres veces que fui cuando viv a en la argentina me maltrataron no le pude ver los ojos al c nsul me coimearon pero a pesar de todo segu teniendo confianza porque es la instituci n que siempre son buenas y nobles les pido si es que han perdido la confianza en su consulado que le den cr dito a juan carlos espinoza quintanilla el c nsul en la patagonia que le crean un cachito hagan una prueba
2275513 nuestras relaciones ahora son normales gracias a la voluntad de los dos presidentes y de nuestras canciller as las hemos ido construyendo
2275514 los d as 13 y 14 de agosto habr reuniones en la sede de la can en lima en la que se expresar de manera oficial nuestra posici n sobre este punto con la ue a trav s de nuestros equipos t cnicos
2275515 podemos ofrecer estabilidad jur dica puesto que se hicieron cambios que fortalecieran las estructuras de nuestro estado a fin de dar asistencia social efectiva
2275516 de los r ditos que nos da la nacionalizaci n de los hidrocarburos
2275517 que no perjudiquen al referendo que no atenten contra la democracia
2275518 queremos cambios en paz pero no le tememos al pueblo y nos sometemos a su mandato
2275519 no podemos pensar ni en la independencia interna ni en la separaci n
2275520 llamo a esos grupos privilegiados que se sumen a este proceso de cambios a esos que no aceptan que los sectores empobrecidos puedan aplicar pol ticas en beneficio de todos
2275521 el radicalismo del gobierno est llevando a la confrontaci n entre bolivianos y hace matar a los hermanos campesinos
2275522 son personas que nacieron bajo el mismo cielo en los marcos f sicos de la misma naci n son bolivianos
2275523 la ley es la ley y lo dem s son sugerencias
2275524 se someten al imperio pero no quieren someterse al pueblo
2275525 algunos antipatrias ego stas tratar n de frenar este proceso de cambio quiero decirles que la democracia se profundiza avanza
2275526 dec an refer ndum ahora no quieren no atenten contra el voto del pueblo nos someteremos al pueblo que nos juzgue
2275527 son las acciones de un dictador disfrazado de dem crata que lo nico que hace es alentar el enfrentamiento entre bolivianos me siento frustrado apenado y dolido por la muerte de esos mineros a manos de la polic a que obedece al presidente
2275528 esas fuerzas que estaban acostumbradas a operar en ausencia del estado y a usurpar el poder popular hoy se ven pr cticamente asediadas por una conciencia ciudadana que ha decidido rechazar la gesti n del prefecto su rez esta es la reacci n que se ha manifestado en trinidad con este atentado criminal
2275529 se autoatenta quiere hacer una cortina de humo para tapar sus asesinatos de oruro
2275530 fuerzas ocultas del modelo neoliberal conservador intentan frenar este refer ndum a trav s de comit s c vicos y la mal llamada media luna pero este proceso democr tico es imparable y se acerca el momento de la aprobaci n de la nueva constituci n
2275531 ahora somos un pa s viable confiable que tiene mucho y tiene esperanza
2275532 argentina lleva a ch vez sin aviso y frustra a lula
2275533 el presidente de venezuela insiste y consigue conversar con lula durante 40 minutos en la sede de la canciller a argentina
2275534 alentar la democracia en bolivia y se aplica para los bolivianos que desempe en funciones en entidades p blicas y privadas en argentina
2275535 se estableci que los ciudadanos de pa ses lim trofes radicados en la rep blica argentina que trabajen en relaci n de dependencia gozar n en sus empleos de hasta cuatro d as de licencia a los fines de que puedan concurrir a emitir su voto cuando se realicen elecciones en su pa s de origen
2275536 el gobierno nacional estima valioso alentar la participaci n democr tica
2275537 comunicar dicha circunstancia a su empleador con una anticipaci n no menor a diez d as corridos a la fecha del comicio
2275538 sabemos que el gobierno ha llevado libros de inscripci n a la argentina decenas y centenares de libros para inscribir a la gente en la argentina porque se podr a decir de qu vale que le den asueto si no est n en el padr n electoral
2275539 pero sabemos que han sido registrados de manera arbitraria ilegal y esa gente va a poder votar porque est registrada aunque no viva aqu es un poco otra de las ilegalidades del gobierno porque no hay una ley que le permita a los bolivianos votar en el extranjero
2275540 tampoco han sido inscritos ellos en los libros electorales en el territorio nacional ellos han llevado los libros all se han inventando sellos u otras cosas pero bueno a n as sabiendo que eso va a ocurrir en tarija asumimos este desaf o y por cuarta vez en tres a os vamos a volver a derrotar a evo morales
2275541 si no no tendr a ning n sentido que la gente venga a votar si no est empadronada ellos hicieron ese trabajo de manera ilegal
2275542 estoy en este momento en yacuiba incluso alguna gente est discutiendo la posibilidad de cerrar la frontera para que no puedan entrar pero nosotros les decimos que voten tambi n son bolivianos
2275543 las comunidades ind genas est n descontentas con este gobierno
2275544 evo morales y su radicalismo no han venido a sucre l no ha querido reconocer que ha cometido errores no quiere reconciliarse
2275545 las comunidades ind genas est n descontentas con este gobierno a l no lo reconocen como ind gena y ahora es peor ahora que se muestra como un militar como un dictador porque a esos tiempos ha vuelto as se ha manejado el presidente
2275546 porque somos ind genas originarios nacimos vivimos y sufrimos en el campo por esa misma experiencia no hay que discriminar ni tratar mal a la gente pero lamentablemente l y su gente discriminan hablan de oligarcas en la media luna regiones del suroriente eso no me gusta porque todos somos humanos estamos en democracia y todos tienen derecho a ser ricos o ser pobres
2275547 mucha gente perdi ojos manos y o dos en los enfrentamientos l morales deber a reconocer sus errores l ha mandado a sucre a sus ponchos rojos los ind genas radicales militares y francotiradores para matarnos por eso nuestro pueblo exige disculpas en chuquisaca somos respetuosos educados pac ficos pero lamentablemente el gobierno ha provocado y tenemos que reaccionar
2275548 evo pudo ser el primer presidente del cambio y decidi ser el ltimo de la podredumbre
2275549 lo que quiere el presidente es enfrentamiento es tomar el poder total
2275550 este refer ndum no va a solucionar nada al contrario conseguir el prop sito del presidente que haya m s luto m s enfrentamiento
2275551 la escasez de combustibles una inflaci n galopante la pobreza cada vez m s lamentable la migraci n de bolivianos
2275552 como sucedi en pa ses como chile o algunos de europa
2275553 en nuestro movimiento hay gente que no ha militado nunca en partidos pol ticos
2275554 fui opositor al gobierno de gonzalo s nchez de lozada
2275555 hay pobreza hay injusticia es cierto tambi n ha habido una partidocracia corrupta en gobiernos recientes que en su momento dio esperanza porque lamentablemente el presidente morales naci como una esperanza para todos l fue escogido con un hist rico 53 7 de los votos evo morales pudo haber sido el primer presidente del cambio verdadero y ha decidido ser el ltimo de la podredumbre
2275556 cu l es la diferencia entre los neoliberales y el actual gobierno hay menos corrupci n menos contrabando menos narcotr fico siguen y como nunca antes
2275557 c mo no vamos a hacer una huelga de hambre si se nos ha cercenado todos los recursos y no es un regalo
2275558 as como los neoliberales regalaron este pa s este neopopulismo est tratando de volver a centralizar todos los recursos pero con el manejo de los hidrocarburos ha ocurrido que en la segunda reserva de gas del cono sur bolivia no tengamos gas para cumplir con los contratos con brasil y argentina ni tengamos la posibilidad para ofrecerle gas a chile donde hay una econom a complementaria y lo que est sucediendo producto de esa nacionalizaci n que ahuyent capitales privados
2275559 el gobierno est haciendo una campa a medi tica parecida al nazismo tratando de debilitar a las regiones a los gobernadores diciendo que somos sediciosos que estamos conspirando que somos producto del neoliberalismo pasado
2275560 la inserci n de ir n en am rica latina
2275561 la inserci n de ir n en am rica latina lamentablemente a manos de venezuela nos sigue preocupando
2275562 es muy importante mostrar el compromiso de toda la sociedad de toda la gente en la lucha contra la discriminaci n y el antisemitismo
2275563 la sociedad argentina y las autoridades conocen tratan el tema y est n concientes y quieren luchar contra el antisemitismo
2275564 tiene suficientes problemas sin eso y espero que no se siga agregando m s dolores de cabeza
2275565 en general para am rica latina hay que tener cuidado de no introducir esta cultura de odio esta cultura de resentimiento que puede traer problemas y enfrentamientos
2275566 en la actualidad el antisemitismo es cada vez m s violento y m s venenoso hay que luchar contra eso
2275567 decenas de vascas y vascos han salido o saldr n en las pr ximas fechas con la doble intenci n de conocer pueblos en lucha por su liberaci n social y o nacional y de dar a conocer en esos pueblos la existencia de un peque o pueblo a ambos lados de los pirineos que lucha por construir el socialismo en un territorio euskal herria
2275568 los brigadistas dan a conocer la situaci n de negaci n y falta de derechos b sicos que vive euskal herria su historia su lengua y cultura y su lucha por el reconocimiento del derecho de autodeterminaci n y por el proyecto pol tico de la izquierda vasca el socialismo
2275569 es el continente en el cual se encuentra euskal herria y en el que se encuentran un mont n de naciones sin estado en las cuales hay gentes que luchan por sus derechos nacionales
2275570 de los pueblos originarios por la autodeterminaci n por la recuperaci n de su lengua y cultura por desarrollar su propio modelo pol tico comunitario por la tierra

2275676 we didnt know each other at all the four of us before we made the first preliminary
2275677 we had no idea whether there was going to be a sequel or what was going to happen in the future but we did create this bond very early on so we stayed friends in the in between time between the two films when the second one came around we were like great they want to take us to greece and put us up and we get to work and be together so it was a good time
2275678 weve been there for each other through the changes in our careers
2275679 we really are friends thankfully amber and alexis have both been through the unique experience of being on a television show and being the title character and knowing what that schedule is like so i really leaned on them for a lot of support the first year with betty and then blake started with gossip girl we said this is what you have to do get someone now to help you do these things we stayed in touch we really are as close as you can be when youve got crazy schedules
2275680 she manages to stay confident i think in ways that is a very general lesson but the characters are so different betty doesnt let anything get to her for carmen especially in the first movie and this movie she leans on her friends very heavily
2275681 i dont think any of my self esteem issues started with anything to do with my career i think it started when youre wanting to fit in with the cool kids in 2nd grade i think thats where it all begins when i went away to college i had a very similar experience to carmen and i could really relate to going away and being away from everything thats familiar and i was outgoing and made friends easily and thought college will be a breeze ill fit right in it will be fine and then i got there and the first year was really difficult because nothing is familiar
2275682 i think whats important is there continues to be diverse representations of what it means to be latina
2275683 growing up i saw representations of latino culture but nothing that i related to and i dont think there is one experience that can say this is what it means to be latina in this country i think there are so many experiences bettys experiences and family that is only one representation of it

2275763 although those wont make lich king theyll probably be in our first content patch because weve been looking at the ui mods like questhelper and carbonite

2275816 we thought that brown with his calvinistic background and his dyed in the wool socialism which he certainly projected would make a difference he could have brought the party back to the grassroots which he hasnt done when he got in he was talking about change but has a change occurred between the blair government and his government i cant say ive noticed it

2275981 los grupos que protestan saben que el gobierno necesita apoyo en la coyuntura actual entonces saben que es el momento de presionar
2275982 no es casual que esto ocurra ahora el gobierno necesita ser ratificado y la cob sabe eso el gobierno tiene que terminar cediendo a sus pedidos
2275983 las marchas de hoy suman un problema al conflicto existente
2275984 una de las causas centrales de la ca da de gonzalo s nchez de losada en 2003 fue el d ficit fiscal creado por la modificaci n del sistema de pensiones de 1996 que hoy sigue en pie

2275987 la lucha por la autonom a en bolivia gira en torno a la distribuci n de los ingresos por el gas natural y la tierra

2276027 kesukaran si ibu mengadaptasikan sistem tubuh mereka dengan perubahan perubahan ini menyebabkan berlakunya komplikasi sepanjang kehamilan ini namun demikian rawatan yang awal akan dapat menyelamatkan ibu dan kandungannya
2276028 kadangkala komplikasi ini teriadi kerana rahim si ibu itu sendiri tidak dalam keadaan yang normal misalnya seperti kes pintu rahim terbuka jarang berlaku tetapi memang ada kes pintu rahim yang tidak boleh ditutup dan menyebabkan berlakunya pendarahan
2276029 jika ada salah seorang ahli keluarga si ibu yang mengidap penyakit ini kemungkinan menghadapi tekanan darah tinggi semasa hamil lebih tinggi
2276030 serangan sawan semasa hamil sangat merbahaya kerana ia boleh menyebabkan kedua bayi dan ibu meninggal jika tidak dirawat dengan sempurna
2276031 masalah ini perlu di kesan awal kerana ia boleh menyebabkan bayi dalam kandungan cacat jika ia dapat dikesan dengan lebih awal kandungan gula dalam air kencing akan dapat di stabilkan oleh yang demikian perlu bagi siibu mengandung mengawasi diet mereka untuk mengelakan komplikasi kencing manis semasa hamil
2276032 dokter saya baru hamil untuk pertama kalinya usia saya 22 tahun saya menikah bulan maret yang lalu dan saat ini hamil enam minggu beberapa hari yang lalu saya periksa kehamilan dokter mengatakan bahwa kandungan saya lemah selain disarankan minum obat penguat saya juga tidak boleh bekerja berat atau terlalu lelah karena katanya saya bisa mengalami keguguran memang dokter tidak bilang bahwa saya harus istirahat total hanya tidak boleh kelelahan karena itu saya memutuskan untuk pulang kembali ke rumah orangtua sebab mengurus rumah sendiri akan bikin saya kelelahan yang ingin saya tanyakan 1 sebetulnya apa yang dimaksud kandungan lemah apakah ini sama dengan kondisi tubuh saya tidak kuat dalam arti stamina jelek 2 apa yang merjadi penyebab seseorang disebut memiliki kandungan lemah 3 apa yang harus diantisipasi dan dijalanit jika seseorang divonis kandungannya lemah 4 adakah obat atau terapi khusus untuk kandungan lemah jika makan obat apakah tidak berdampak buruk bagi si janin setahu saya selama hamil kita tidak boleh makan obat karena berarti janin juga akan ikut memakannya 5 jika kandungan saya lemah apa dampaknya bagi kesehatan janin jika kelak dilahirkan 6 apakah saya boleh minum ramuan obat tradisional cina yang kandungannya colla corniasini radix rehmanniae dan fructus crataegi yang berkhasiat menambah energi dan darah selain meningkatkan daya imun terima kasih atas perhatian dan penjelasan dokter

2276034 tight monetary measures will tame inflation in three to six months
2276035 what we are trying to do given the price hike is to moderate aggregate demand by using tight monetary measures by sacrificing a bit of growth
2276036 there are signs of moderation commodities and oil prices but i cannot say whether the trend will continue
2276037 we are doing our best to overcome inflation it is driven by crude oil and commodities prices over which we have no control
2276038 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2276039 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2276040 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2276041 despite restraint orders penalties and prosecutions launched by sebi against him he has not refrained from luring the public committing fraud and operating as an unregistered portfolio manager
2276042 we think that the general market is being moved along by the surprising strength of the dollar which is exacerbating the slide in oil prices so all positive for stocks
2276043 and i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2276044 they want us to believe that there is nothing that unites us as americans there is only what divides us
2276045 theyll seek out the narrowest and most divisive ground that is the strategy to always argue small instead of looking at the big picture
2276046 they will stand in the way of any attempt to find common ground their days are growing dark it is time to turn the page
2276047 the first thing id do as president would be to sign the freedom of choice act
2276048 but as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness
2276049 any catholic who takes the abortion issue seriously will not vote for obama
2276050 based on his record he appears to be the most pro abortion candidate ever to seek the presidency
2276051 its hard to be more pro abortion than hillary clinton but he seems to have managed to do that
2276052 the most important thing facing america is to promote abortion
2276053 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a 9 month old child that was delivered to term
2276054 that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place
2276055 thats pretty doctrinaire thats about as pro death as you can get on the abortion issue
2276056 hes a candidate who is not just for abortion but also for infanticide in order to protect the right to abortion
2276057 look ive got two daughters nine years old and six years old
2276058 i am going to teach them first of all about values and morals but if they make a mistake i dont want them punished with a baby
2276059 to view a child as a punishment under any circumstances to me shows that this is not a man who values life who respects the dignity of human life
2276060 a child is not something owed to one but is a gift a child may not be considered a piece of property an idea to which an alleged right to a child would lead in this area only the child possesses genuine rights including the right to be respected as a person from the moment of his conception
2276061 somehow by sen obamas standard even judge roberts didnt measure up and neither did justice samuel alito apparently nobody quite fits the bill except for an elite group of activist judges lawyers and law professors who think they know wisdom when they see it and they see it only in each other
2276062 whats truly elitist is to appoint judges who will protect the powerful and leave ordinary americans to fend for themselves
2276063 his support is among the secularist wing of the democratic party
2276064 hes beholden to that wing of the party the most extreme wing of the party the

2276075 el per no puede arreglar esta diferencia con bolivia con presiones ni reclamos sino con argumentos convincentes y eso es lo que parece que no quiere nuestro gobierno el presidente garc a debi haber anunciado que esto se iba a arreglar por la v a diplom tica y no con terquedades

2276108 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life
2276109 the sliding trend in oil prices in the past week coupled with some positives cues from the political circles boosted confidence of the investors it will take some time before we see any clear cut direction as investors are booking profits on every opportunity we might see some stock specific action in the day to come as the reforms from the government slowly starts to pan out

2276120 came back with six pages of notes on future strategy
2276121 the following excerpt was from the wsj on the ebay acquisition the acquisition is ebays latest effort to reignite its growth particularly in mature markets such as the u s and germany the authors had the data needed to understand the real reason for the acquitition when they said shopping com for example relies on google to place advertisements on its site those ads accounted for 44 of the brisbane calif companys revenue of 28 9 million in the first quarter according to the companys quarterly filing with the securities and exchange commission ebay officials declined to address the future of the relationship between shopping com and google which also declined to comment but they missed the point ebay is googles largest customer as they buy ads on google to redirect traffic to their own auctions shopping com competes with ebay for supply of words on google this competition drives up the price of words on google reducing the roi on marketing spend for both companies by acquiring shopping com ebay will be able to reduce their marketing spend to google by paying less for ad words because they can integrate shopping coms demand rather than compete with it in an acution ebay bought shopping com to reduce their cost and improve margins the rationale for the acquisition was not motivated by growth the wall street analysts missed the point too as the subsequent quotes in the article point out there appears to be a substantial amount of interest from buyers and sellers away from ebay said derek brown an analyst at pacific growth equities it seems to be a way for ebay to reach a new pool of potential buyers and sellers if the price of google ad words goes down googles revenue growth rate will slow given the time it will take ebay to integrate the shopping com acquisition look for this to happen around the time ebays margins begin to expand late this year

2276172 the al aqsa martyrs brigades claimed responsibility tuesday evening for the stabbing of a female israel defense forces soldier in the face by a palestinian woman at a checkpoint outside the west bank city of nablus earlier in the day
2276173 the murder of females in the middle east is an ancient tradition prior to the arrival of islam in ad 622 arabs occasionally buried infant daughters to avoid the possibility that they would later bring shame to the family this practice continued through the centuries it may still occur today among bedouins who consider girls most likely to sully the family honor
2276174 several thousand women a year are victims of honor killings numerous murders are ruled an accident suicide or family dispute if theyre reported at all police and government officials are often bribed to ignore crimes and hinder investigations a woman beaten burned strangled shot or stabbed to death is often ruled a suicide even when there are multiple wounds
2276175 honor killings occur for a variety of offenses including allegations of premarital or extramarital sex refusing an arranged marriage attempting to obtain a divorce or simply talking with a man
2276176 in the palestinian communities of the west bank gaza strip israel and jordan women are executed in their homes in open fields and occasionally in public sometimes before crowds of cheering onlookers honor killings account for virtually all of the murders of palestinian women in these areas
2276177 women whose social standing is problematic including women who have acquired a bad name due to assumed promiscuity or extra marital relationships have often been convinced to take part in terrorist operations as a means of rehabilitating their status and character in palestinian society included among these operations are suicide bombings
2276178 reliable palestinian sources well informed of events in the bethlehem area have shed important light on the modus operandi of the fatah tanzim in their recruitment of one such young woman to carry out a suicide attack the report of the palestinian sources to israeli officials described the recruitment as follows a the target for recruitment a 20 year old woman a resident of bethlehem was recruited by fatah tanzim during the course of october 2002 in order to carry out a suicide attack within israel c the method of recruitment the young woman was blackmailed into recruitment for a suicide operation by use of social and psychological coercion after she had become involved in an illicit personal relationship this method of coercion often used by fatah tanzim is characterized by the seduction of young women into illicit relationships or the arrangement of their rape subsequently overwhelming emotional pressure is brought to bear on the women in order to convince them to commit suicide in an admirable manner since the public revelation of their impropriety would in palestinian society constitute an intolerable disgrace to the honor of their families

2276210 i knew that the end of september was the last period of time before the explosion but when sharon reached the al aqsa mosque this was the most appropriate moment for the outbreak of the intifada the night prior to sharons visit i participated in a panel on a local television station and i seized the opportunity to call on the public to go to the al aqsa mosque in the morning for it was not possible that sharon would reach al haram al sharif just so and walk away peacefully i finished and went to al aqsa in the morning we tried to create clashes without success because of the differences of opinion that emerged with others in the al aqsa compound at the time

2276245 although ive been aware from the start that my books might offend some people ive never been afraid of physical harm because of them i wrote these books because i felt called to write them after researching aisha for my own purposes my passion for her story trumps the fear factor ive expected controversy yes but never terrorism
2276246 all i did was try to portray aisha muhammads child bride believed by most historians to have married muhammad at age nine and consummated the marriage at age 11 in the context of her times

2276274 what needs to be challenged are preconceptions and biased evaluations of women and other groups newer to the professional workplace
2276275 what i was impressed with really was how effective the women in these meetings were
2276276 women speaking up getting and using turns in workplace meetings
2276277 given that i could see that women were doing a good job and
2276278 im not seeing that women are significantly different from men
2276279 women questioned more rather than saying things for certain so it was a reflection of womens uncertainty or insecurity
2276280 what i found remarkable given the research thats been done on women and language over the last three decades was the power that i could see that questions had for getting someone the chance to speak perhaps even at length
2276281 when they really had something to say they thought was going to make a difference
2276282 for instance saying something like this may be stating the obvious prefacing what you say by a little bit of a downplaying
2276283 its actually an effective thing to do it probably disarms people men do it and women do it

2276303 that provided a wonderful opportunity for us to get these books to those poeple who wanted them and keep in business
2276304 were very happy with the response were getting it only comprises maybe 10 per cent of our business but its a 10 per cent that we maybe would not otherwise get because of the uniqueness of some of these books
2276305 it was time for us as a couple and as a family it was time for us to move on and do other things

2276321 we dont think he was physically quite with the rest of the team
2276322 he had a little tweak he has had it before we worked him back and probably could have went back on the field this morning

2276371 cooperation is necessary but plan mexico or the accord should pass through the mexican senate
2276372 if this is overseen by the u s congress without the involvement of the mexican congress the program will not reflect the wishes of the mexican public

2276376 particularly in demanding times of significant market correction and turbulences it is the responsibility of the central bank to solidly anchor inflation expectations to avoid additional volatility
2276377 they dont have the philosophy we do in terms of activism

2276379 these men were indifferent to the carnage that would ensue

2276381 the authorities would be unable to prevent the other flights from meeting a similar fate as they would already be in midair and carrying their deadly cargo
2276382 our own government prioritises profit for nz companies above the lives of innocent people and refuses to challenge the chinese government on their appalling suppression of the tibetan people
2276383 we will remember beijing housing activist ye guozhu and the thousands of other community organisers and pro democracy activists who have been killed or still languish in chinese prisons simply for speaking out and challenging the state

2276387 whoso judgeth not by that which allah hath revealed such are disbelievers kafiroon
2276388 say o muslims we believe in allah and that which is revealed is unto us and that which was revealed unto abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes and that add that which the prophets received from their lord we make no distinction between any of them and unto him we have surrendered
2276389 and remember when allah said o jesus lo i am gathering thee and causing thee to ascend unto me and am cleansing thee of those who disbelieve until the day of resurrection then unto me ye will all return and i shall judge between you as to that wherein ye used to differ
2276390 and zachariah and john and jesus and elias each one of them was of the righteous
2276391 believe ye in part of the scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof and what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world and on the day of resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom for allah is not unaware of what ye do
2276392 and say lo i even i am a plain warner such as we send down for those who make division those who break the quran into parts them by thy lord we shall question every one of what they used to do
2276393 stereotypes are very very resistant to change but as a scientist i have to challenge them with data
2276394 so parents and teachers need to revise their thoughts about this
2276395 because if your mom or your teacher thinks you cant do math that can have a big impact on your math self concept
2276396 boys did a teeny bit better in some states and girls did a teeny bit better in others
2276397 but when you average them all you essentially get no difference
2276398 but we need to motivate teachers to do so by including those items on the tests
2276399 so youre dipping farther down into the distribution of female talent which brings down the average score
2276400 that may be the explanation for the results rather than girls arent as good as math
2276401 but as a scientist i have to challenge them with data

2276408 the mayor has ensured the number of staff travelling to the games is kept to the absolute minimum he will personally only be present for the last few days of the olympics and will travel with just three members of his team

2276428 the only ice i saw this year was in my cup at the cafeteria
2276429 it was a big glaring clue that something not natural was happening

2276431 we have evidence complaints from candidates who were kidnapped or intimidated or who received threats intended to influence the results of an election and the behavior of candidates

2276434 it doesnt look too good more than half say theyre voting for clinton
2276435 hillarys got the advantage over obama especially since shell probably get a good chunk of the hispanic vote
2276436 the clintons are known here to many hispanics obama is a new face thats attractive to many people and risky to many others
2276437 what were seeing here is the maturation of the hispanic vote you have hispanic parents many of them immigrants many not who have lived through the clinton years which are synonymous with economic prosperity and stability hispanic culture is matriarchal and the idea of a woman president is very appealing then you have their kids who identify with obama and see him as a minority who came from nothing whose african father was an immigrant
2276438 theres an actual fight for the hispanic vote a historical line has been crossed in the past the hispanic vote has never been a priority for the democratic party but clinton has long made it one of her priorities and now you have obama gaining ground
2276439 yes obama may be attracting a lot of young voters but we older voters have been more reliable than them
2276440 we have immediately taken action on bisphenol a because we believe it is our responsibility to ensure families canadians and our environment are not exposed to a potentially harmful chemical
2276441 its pretty clear that the highest risk is for newborns and young infants
2276442 we cannot wait to act if there is any serious risk at all posed by this chemical it is simply unacceptable to allow americans especially vulnerable infants to come into contact with it

2276449 it is my duty to make a respectful but firm call to the candidates of the various political parties in the united states for them to stop using mexicans in that country as thematic hostages of their speeches and their strategies

2276508 if we are going to break the cycle of violence that sees a third of all women in wales suffering from some sort of violence then we need to start by challenging attitudes towards violence against women amongst students and the population at large
2276509 the welsh assembly government should consider a comprehensive campaign aimed at preventing violence making it far less acceptable on our campuses and in our communities

2276577 las crisis le resbalan cual aceite en una sart n de tefl n
2276578 las crisis se les resbalan cual aceite en una sart n de tefl n
2276579 advertimos que todas estas razones que se aducen son intr nsecas y aluden a su persona pero esa especie de efervescencia anal tica del fen meno evo olvida el gigantesco peso de las razones extr nsecas en muchos casos se olvida el contexto y se olvida sobre todo el peso de las herencias
2276580 su xito es directamente proporcional a los errores cometidos durante los ltimos a os por el conjunto de partidos pol ticos que se convirtieron en simples m quinas electorales sin programas e ideas diferenciadas los unos de los otros aquellos que hablaban de democracia hacia fuera pero nunca practicaron una democracia interna
2276581 por eso los bolivianos tienen temor de dejar de creer en evo
2276582 y por sobre todas las cosas no quieren que alguien les diga que el presidente probablemente se equivoca con las pol ticas de nacionalizaci n y que tal vez estemos desperdiciando el mejor momento de crecimiento sostenido del pa s
2276583 hecho de miedo y de cansancio un tefl n hecho de la inmensa sensaci n de fracaso que han dejado los gobiernos anteriores la prueba est en los desastrosos resultados que tiene hoy en d a la imagen de la oposici n carente de recursos pol ticos y de estrategias
2276584 los bolivianos aunque no se den cuenta quieren a evo por defecto
2276585 y qu n ufrago acepta que se le pregunte qu le parece la calidad del madero al que se abraza en medio del oleaje por supuesto prefiere no saber
2276586 si fu ramos bolivianas y bolivianos votar amos por evo morales el 10 de agosto
2276587 mario coss o qui n era era presidente de la c mara de diputados por lo tanto diputado de s nchez de lozada leopoldo fern ndez era senador ministro de tuto quiroga diputado de adn y ahora prefecto de podemos qui n era manfred reyes villa aliado de go i de b nzer su hermano era ministro de go i de b nzer y de tuto era parte del equipo neoliberal
2276588 es muy preocupante lo que est pasando ahora en bolivia hay que respaldar al presidente para que pueda seguir con su camino de cambios
2276589 evo es soberbio no le gusta el di logo foment el odio que ahora divide a los bolivianos tengo miedo de que si es revocado vengan los campesinos a tomar la ciudad
2276590 la cosa ven a tranquilita pero con los dos mineros muertos del martes pasado se calde el asunto
2276591 cuando digo que voto por el no me acusan de capitalista de traidor
2276592 voy a votar por el s porque est todo mejor desde que lleg el evo
2276593 ah estamos todos con el evo que hizo mucho por nosotros
2276594 esto no va a resolver nada es m s lo va a empeorar
2276595 viviendo una aguda polarizaci n pol tica con una crisis de estado bastante pronunciada debido a que existen en bolivia dos visiones contrapuestas ambas con una base social bastante amplia ambas legitimidades todav a no han logrado ser integradas armonizadas y conciliadas en el proyecto de constituci n
2276596 se ratifique al mandatario as como a algunos prefectos opositores sobre todo en la regi n de la media luna
2276597 es seguramente la mejor para morales pero puede ser el escenario m s peligroso para el pa s porque podr a inducir en el equipo de gobierno la tentaci n de aprobar el proyecto constitucional tal como est redactado si esto sucediera el pa s virtualmente se podr a poner al borde de la divisi n poniendo en riesgo la integridad del territorio
2276598 lo considere como un cheque en blanco para imponer su constituci n sin modificarle una coma
2276599 tambi n puede darse el otro escenario que se d cuenta de que hay un nuevo empate
2276600 deben interpretarse los resultados como la necesidad de abrir mesas de di logo y acuerdo en aquellas reas donde evidentemente haya grados de conflicto que no permitan llevar adelante las pol ticas del gobierno
2276601 eso contribuir a a un escenario de concertaci n donde estos actores pol ticos acepten de una vez por todas ir a una mesa de negociaci n para modificar a fondo tanto el proyecto de carta magna como los proyectos de estatutos auton micos departamentales
2276602 lo que va a primar pol ticamente es lo que decida la cne le guste al gobierno o no le guste a algunos miembros de la oposici n o no
2276603 la resoluci n de la corte ver infograf a beneficia a los prefectos porque no ha variado el porcentaje que requiere la ratificaci n del presidente sobre la revocaci n de un prefecto de la oposici n quiero ver a mis colegas bregando en el parlamento para que se aplique la ley de convocatoria no lo van a hacer porque van a terminar respaldando la resoluci n de la cne porque les conviene
2276604 en ninguna parte del mundo tampoco en bolivia se le exige forzosamente al presidente que gane en todo el territorio
2276605 todos por el s a evo al cambio a la revoluci n
2276606 el proceso de cambio en bolivia y en am rica latina es al continuidad de las luchas anticolonialistas lideradas entre otros por tupac amaru
2276607 cesen las amenazas las agresiones y las humillaciones de los pueblos originarios
2276608 la propiedad privada sobre la vida y sobre la tierra
2276609 nos sentimos realmente agradecidos con todo el pueblo ecuatoriano con las instituciones con las organizaciones por toda esta muestra de solidaridad y eso evidencia que nuestros pa ses realmente son uno solo
2276610 en este refer ndum adem s de hacer participar a nuestra gente lo que nosotros queremos es hacer un reclamo y hacerle saber a la comunidad internacional y a la opini n p blica de nuestro pa s que los bolivianos que residen en el exterior queremos votar y participar en las decisiones electorales
2276611 las dictaduras de los 60 y 70 est n siendo sustituidas por algunos grupos que toman aeropuertos cortes departamentales electorales y que balean autos de ministros
2276612 faltando unos d as para el revocatorio quiero alertarlos y pedirles que defiendan este proceso no s lo estructural y social sino tambi n democr tico donde el pueblo boliviano decida a trav s de su voto
2276613 pido a las fuerzas armadas tumbar al presidente de la rep blica
2276614 siempre dispuestos al di logo y a facilitar el mismo cuando sea necesario
2276615 esto es algo a tomar en cuenta por el consejo supremo electoral sobre todo porque la invitaci n viene de un gobierno de izquierda progresista con evidente apertura en cuanto a la observaci n y con una clara intenci n de que los resultados se den a conocer lo m s pronto posible
2276616 nosotros por principio y responsabilidad no nos debemos involucrar en ese tipo de actividades lo mismo le decimos al presidente y magistrados del consejo supremo electoral que no participen en actividades partidarias porque ponen en riesgo su credibilidad
2276617 pero lo m s sospechoso es la habilidad de los partidos pol ticos de estar movilizando simpatizantes hacia determinado sector en b squeda de aumentar su votos esto se puede convertir en delito el estar moviendo ciudadanos sin que lo hayan solicitado nicamente con el objeto de votar en un sector determinado
2276618 a mi s lo me matar n pero ma ana volver y ser millones
2276619 estamos en el umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
2276620 este es un montaje de golpe de estado al t pico estilo de las dictaduras
2276621 lo que hoy d a est n haciendo los prefectos dos de ellos en huelga de hambre por demandas locales no es nada m s que un acto de sedici n de desacato de organizaci n de fuerzas ilegales paramilitares para atentar contra todas las libertades p blicas
2276622 anoche revisaba una encuesta dec a que el presidente ser ratificado con el 59 de los votos
2276623 lamento mucho que ahora que las dictaduras del 60 y 70 est n siendo sustituidas por algunos grupos que toman aeropuertos
2276624 el refer ndum es para que el pueblo boliviano con su voto defina la pol tica econ mica
2276625 los prefectos hacen dictadura civil tomando los aeropuertos esas logias intentan frenar este proceso de cambio al pueblo s lo le salvar el pueblo
2276626 hay familias ricas que no aceptan la igualdad entre los bolivianos todos los bolivianos debemos tener los mismos deberes y derechos
2276627 no est n en huelga de hambre por los impuestos est n contra el refer ndum contra el pueblo y la democracia pero el domingo los prefectos neoliberales ser n derrotados
2276628 ahora las encuestas dicen que vamos a ser ratificados con 59 yo estoy seguro que sobre ese 59 vamos a aumentar 15 o 20 y la derecha lo sabe
2276629 nunca antes un presidente fue tan amable tan considerado con nosotros cuando asegura que a este proceso de cambio no lo para nadie que estar por los pobres me emociona realmente
2276630 el 80 est ac con el presidente lo quieren mucho
2276631 lo que hoy d a est n haciendo los prefectos no es nada m s que un acto de sedici n de desacato de organizaci n de fuerzas ilegales paramilitares para atentar contra todas las libertades p blicas
2276632 llamo al pueblo a defender la democracia defender nuestras instituciones a profundizar la democracia para decidir el destino del pa s y de sus autoridades
2276633 pido a las fuerzas armadas tumbar al presidente de la rep blica
2276634 los gobiernos militares de los 70 fueron sustituidos por algunos grupos que toman cortes electorales aeropuertos balean autos de ministros hago un llamado al pueblo boliviano a defender la democracia y participar del refer ndum revocatorio quien sirve al pueblo no tiene miedo al pueblo
2276635 una estrategia ya no dirigida a impedir el refer ndum sino que busca la desestabilizaci n del orden constitucional desplomar la democracia
2276636 tuto quiroga me ha decepcionado por su falta de patriotismo y por haber demostrado que no es un gran estadista podemos ha perdido un seguidor
2276637 pido a las fuerzas armadas tumbar al presidente de la rep blica
2276638 hay ministros que no coordinan no tienen una relaci n de afinidad y eso lo debe entender el presidente creemos que despu s del 10 de agosto debe existir una reestructuraci n los ind genas podemos conducir este gobierno
2276639 a la autonom a ind gena no la vamos a negociar vamos a marchar por la aprobaci n de una ley de refer ndum para poner en vigencia la nueva constituci n de otra forma no nos van a respetar la autonom a departamental no se va a imponer ser la autonom a ind gena en igualdad con los otros tres tipos de autonom a seg n la nueva constituci n
2276640 estamos en el umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
2276641 lamento mucho que ahora las dictaduras del 60 y 70 est n siendo sustituidas por algunos grupos que toman aeropuertos
2276642 tenemos los bolivianos que defender este proceso de profundas transformaciones democr ticas ante la presencia de una dictadura civil que est atentando contra la democracia por encima de cualquier reivindicaci n social econ mica y regional primero est la unidad de bolivia
2276643 este es un montaje de golpe de estado al t pico estilo de las dictaduras lo que hoy en d a est n haciendo los prefectos tres de ellos en huelga de hambre por demandas locales no es nada m s que un acto de sedici n
2276644 queremos reemplazar el actual sistema privado de jubilaciones por uno de reparto con aporte de una cuota patronal como en argentina
2276645 nuestro paro es por reivindicaciones docentes y en apoyo a la jubilaci n de los mineros
2276646 pero no perjudican a morales quieren que vuelvan los liberales que ustedes detestan
2276647 morales replic gobierna para los empresarios s lo se aplasta a la derecha con la lucha popular y las movilizaciones en lugar de expulsar a las empresas dialoga y les da contratos
2276648 pero si evo hace eso lo tachan de radical y comunista
2276649 evo no es comunista ni radical el defiende la propiedad privada y debemos ir a la colectivizaci n
2276650 bolivia se encuentra en el umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
2276651 la estrategia ya no es frenar el referendo sino derrocar al presidente de la rep blica y desplomar el orden democr tico
2276652 las manifestaciones contra el gobierno en varios departamentos opositores con el uso de recursos de las prefecturas para movilizar a grupos de personas que protagonizan hechos de violencia constituyen el preludio del golpe
2276653 lamento mucho c mo algunos en este momento faltan al respeto al pueblo y aplican esta especie de una dictadura civil atentando contra la democracia
2276654 estamos ac porque queremos una mejor manera de administrar el pa s que son las autonom as por eso estamos por el no al presidente en el referendo revocatorio y por el s al prefecto de cruce o que significa el cambio hacia una mayor independencia
2276655 de qu golpe de estado estamos hablando decir eso es una provocaci n lo nico que deseamos es vivir en libertad
2276656 son especulaciones que surgen porque evidentemente hay algunos aprestos igualmente no creo que tengan ning n xito sin apoyo de estados unidos
2276657 es de un extremo cinismo decir que bolivia es viable porque no hay inversiones y el dinero se malgasta con el apoyo de ch vez
2276658 frente a este clima de tensi n que se manifiesta tambi n en otras regiones del pa s naciones unidas hace un llamado a todos los actores pol ticos y a la sociedad boliviana en su conjunto para que contribuyan a generar un ambiente de tolerancia y para que toda diferencia sea resuelta mediante el di logo y en el marco del respeto a los derechos humanos
2276659 alertamos al pa s que los ideales de democracia se hallan en peligro por la divisi n intolerancia descalificaci n mutua desconfianza inter s ego sta racismo ilegalidad crisis institucional e imposiciones partidarias sectoriales e ideol gicas
2276660 por encima de lo jur dico est lo pol tico
2276661 tal afirmaci n explica la causa de la crisis institucional pol tica econ mica y regional que empuja al pa s al borde de la divisi n la confrontaci n y el caos
2276662 un alarmante deterioro de las instituciones nos dice que hecha la trampa luego hago la ley
2276663 confiesa que a sabiendas procede al margen de la legalidad
2276664 seg n confiesa l mismo el presidente morales hace lo que le da la gana para lograr los cambios que quiere sin importar si es legal o no adem s en su originaria c smica e infinita ignorancia despu s de que no cumple la ley exige a sus asesores jur dicos que arreguen sus desaguisados
2276665 con esto el presidente da luz verde a los bolivianos para ser evasores de impuestos contrabandistas narcos falsificadores cacos piratas y dem s lindezas seamos honestos evo con esta apolog a del desprecio a la legalidad no ha descubierto la am rica lo cierto y lo tr gico es que en realidad nos estamos enfrentando ante la variante m s burda de lo que es la pol tica boliviana de los ltimos tiempos evo es presidente de bolivia porque las mayor as se sienten identificadas con l evo va a ganar el refer ndum por el mismo motivo
2276666 me quieren sacar para poner a un hombre del presidente
2276667 me pidieron que no fuera a las celebraciones parece que el presidente tem a que lo opacara le gusta s lo brillar a l y no compartir el cari o de la gente lamento que sea as eso no es democracia
2276668 esa es la idea el presidente quiere sacarnos para tener un pleno dominio de la paz ya tiene los dos alcaldes de las ciudades m s grandes del departamento el alto y la paz y la nica vos discordante es el prefecto as es que sac ndolo tendr a pleno poder
2276669 hay una pugna interna sobre qui n me reemplazar sus aliados el partido de gobierno dan por descontado que perder este domingo
2276670 eso es falso es parte de la guerra sucia hemos demostrado a trav s de auditor as que ning n centavo ha salido con destino raro tenemos toda la documentaci n en orden y no hay una sola prueba
2276671 est destrozando la institucionalidad del estado ha abandonado el manejo de la econom a y ha logrado confrontar a los bolivianos como nunca antes existen tendencias racistas regionalistas y ha sembrado odio en el alma misma de los bolivianos un verdadero retroceso
2276672 todos sabemos que no ha sido f cil avanzar en la negociaci n con europa pero tal y como se dijo en la cumbre del alc ue el acuerdo llegar en 2009 y no ser en base al ritmo de los m s lentos en clara alusi n a bolivia sino de los m s comprensivos
2276673 con brasil estamos inaugurando una etapa para darle mayor contenido a la relaci n
2276674 espero que bolivia tenga una posici n que nos permita la negociaci n y eso puede ser o que acepte negociar los tres componentes del acuerdo de asociaci n o que como dicen los mismos europeos participe en dos de esos tres componentes
2276675 es decir si bolivia no quiere participar del acuerdo de libre comercio uno de los tres componentes del acuerdo de asociaci n pues se excluya de eso y m s bien participe de los otros componentes
2276676 cuerdas separadas en aquellos temas de discrepancia o diferenciaci n

2276682 reclaman legitimidades pero est n procediendo en forma irracional y se debe a la falta de instrucci n c vica y cultura porque no fueron educados para actuar mediante los resortes legales que brindan las instituciones democr ticas
2276683 va a ser tan tranquilo como agua de pozo hay mucho ruido y pocas nueces la gente est cansada de la presi n pol tica permanente que se vive en el medio con el ambiente tan tenso que no es bueno para nadie porque no se puede desarrollar plenamente ninguna actividad cualquiera que esta fuese y eso perjudica a todos

2276749 did you see them pull up onto the pavement and park outside costcutters and open fire

2276768 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
2276769 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way

2276771 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the babys butt
2276772 but the doctor understood thats just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they dont have any doubts

2276849 most did not know whether their medical school had a policy for dealing with complaints and the majority did not think there was adequate support for whistleblowers many commented that they did not know who to report problems to or thought that the mechanisms for reporting problems such as sexual harassment and discrimination were ineffective

2276885 industrial terrorists robertson quite properly implied that the industrial dispute had not been directed at the pope or the catholic religious festival but was dictated by industrial necessity he went on to welcome the pope and the religious festival but he used the occasion to invoke his interpretation of catholic social doctrine and the implicitly pro working class aspects of it and served up this interpretation gently but firmly to the visiting pope the pilgrims and by implication to cardinal george pell the subtlety of robertsons approach in this article impressed me mightily and it is in stark contrast to the peculiar antics of some alleged socialists who seem to think there is something leftist about dredging up from the primitive past the anglo australian ascendancys traditional bigoted slogan of no popery getting back to the electricity privatisation struggle richards repeats the story pioneered by the anti socialist so called world socialist web site that the struggle against electricity privatisation will inevitably be defeated he is prepared to countenance an outside possibility gee whiz thanks owen that we might defeat it this time by more conservative methods of struggle but of course the ruling class will try again and eventually win it was jm keynes who said in the long run we are all dead that throwaway line from keynes has a certain application to the class struggle in all its forms it is worth considering that electricity privatisation was defeated 10 years ago in a quite non revolutionary way by the normal methods of mobilising a majority of the state conference of the alp against it it took the ruling class 10 full years to cajole a compliant labor ministry to try again if we defeat it on this occasion as is beginning to look increasingly likely the reactionary forces peddling the privatisation are likely to be so bruised by the experience that they will be cautious about trying it again for quite a while the by product of that situation will be to increase the self confidence of the alp rank and file and of any class conscious or liberal elements in society that such things as further privatisations can more easily be defeated by some sort of mobilisation the dark third period reactionary pessimism of comrade richards on this question underlines is a complete dead end in developing this sectarian moralizing and presenting it as socialist principles the comrades of direct action are bit like the bourbon kings who are said to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing in fact they are a bit worse than the bourbon kings because they seem to have forgotten what they ever knew about the labour movement the working class and the class struggle i own a bound set of the first 60 or so copies of the old direct action which the old dsp produced after they split with me and my supporters back in the early 1970s those first 60 issues were in fact pretty good papers because they took up the day to day questions of the class struggle in a fairly concrete way from a broadly marxist point of view even after we split apart way back then we shared a pretty well common view of not adopting an ignorant doctrinaire approach to the workers movement the new direct action has largely abandoned all that in favour of what the french marxist leader daniel bensaid described as moralising sectarianism which he said was the besetting sin of some marxist groups bensaid was obviously right about that and his striking phrase still applies a further consideration is that i am completely baffled by is the question of who the producers of the new direct action think will respond to this moralising sectarianism where is the working class or left leaning audience for that stuff it doesnt exist because in so far as people resist the reactionary neoliberal forces that are rampaging in society they are looking for concrete and scientific solutions to their problems telling the people who are rebelling of whom there is an increasing number despite the conservative nature of the period that they have to hang around waiting til a new socialist leadership establishes itself as the dominant force in the workers movement was always nonsense from a marxist point of view it is a formula for sterile hopeless isolation followed by disillusionment in the current difficult circumstances the worst aspect of this approach is that it is a formula for abstention in most important spheres of current working class struggle for instance i have made a point of letting a couple of people in the direct action group know about meetings of the electricity privatisation agitation and i have said that even allowing for the fact that they are getting their organisation up and running some of them should come along to participate in the agitation well they have never turned up and now the political reason for that is a little clearer they are developing what is implicitly a theory of abstention prettied up by left talk about the need for a real socialist leadership ie them the difficulty with that is no socialist leadership in recorded history has ever been constructed seriously such abstentionism why should the working class or any leftward leaning people pay the slightest attention to you when all you do is lecture them in a very grand way and attack their existing organisatoins even when the leadership of those organisation is are doing partially good things the notion of training your supporters in the actual struggle learning from the struggle and adopting a united front strategy is completely alien to this kind of political approach it has nothing to do with the mature marxist politics of past socialist leaders people like lenin and trotsky james p cannon and james connolly would turn in their graves at such doctrinaire nonsense being peddled as marxism this entry was posted on july 14 2008 at 11 33 am and is filed under bob gould you can follow any responses to this entry through the its pretty clear that by far the best clearest most incisive convincing and useful marxist or marxist influenced people today whether activists intellectuals theoreticians writers or all of the above are people who live and work outside of the organisational framework of the far left sects like either the dsp rsp socialist alternative wsws etc and their equivalents internationally this is a neat piece by bob but it begs the question how come the dsp was incapable of to this day explaining in such a clear pedagogical marxist fashion as bob has done here exactly how the rsp were going off the rails they never ever came close to doing so to non dsp members july 15 2008 at 7 17 am to antigone the rsps direction only existed as a potential it was not guaranteed that they would go off into sectarian la la land the dsp majority were reluctant to predict that they would do so as this would merely have fanned the flames and mirrored the rsps ranting about degeneration besides the whole thing scared the hell out of us lets face it any of us could in theory have succumbed to this batshit craziness a further reason why the dsp hasnt tried too hard to criticise the rsp actions speak louder than words jacobite

2276940 we strive to bring baseball back to the olympic programme and the beijing olympic games are our last opportunity to collectively impress ioc members on the field
2276941 we must demonstrate to the international olympic committee that not only does our game belong alongside the other great sports of the world but our sport is manageable from a television and operational standpoint

2276945 this is much more twisty you are always on the turn and all on a line to the fences so the ground could get very chewed up
2276946 its a shame the class is being divided like this because its the last olympics for the tornado
2276947 what could happen is that it is someone wins with a technical advantage rather than a sailing advantage
2276948 it will be interesting to see if they can pull it off
2276949 he should stand up and say there is something wrong we have to do something its not really fair from him i dont want really to race against a different boat
2276950 frankly if all the races are sailed in four to seven knots wed expect the dutch and americans to be 1st and 2nd overall so that everyone else would be racing for the bronze
2276951 we did look at the wind for the next two weeks we had a lot of input from our meteorologist

2276956 if i get there fit and in good shape i know i have got the ability to jump as far as anyone in the world

2276961 my kids are big fans of youtube usually the cats on skateboard kind of clips
2276962 i came to realize that its not just a great medium for skateboarding cats starting an online conversation was an excellent way to reach out to a huge audience largely youth that i dont normally connect with
2276963 youtube is primarily an entertainment network so i did wonder if people would engage in a serious discussion
2276964 it was a leap into the unknown for me but to be honest everything has exceeded my expectations the good and the bad theres more misunderstanding than i had appreciated more anger more bias but also more interest more support and more engagement
2276965 my favorite response is still one of the earliest ones i received are you michael jordans wife my husband found that one very funny
2276966 we have found in our polling that there is a new generation of global citizens developing people because of the internet because of opportunities for travel who have a global sensibility and greater appreciation for other people and other cultures
2276967 whats important here is that theres a direct correlation between those with global sensibilities and those who are networked via facebook and youtube and so on
2276968 these network facilities really enhance those kinds of global mentalities
2276969 theyre a nontraditional generation and we need nontraditional means to reach out and engage them their creativity energy and optimism can foster greater understanding and closer ties between people of different cultures and move us past these present hurdles
2276970 each particular variable is simple and obvious but it turns out that they interact in complicated ways

2276975 we are here to voice our opinion and to speak out and to let the world know that china is using the olympics for propaganda and they are trying to whitewash their worsening human rights record
2276976 it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me and i think thats pretty important
2276977 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

2276987 the markets are more focused on the dollar and its newfound strength oil is less looking at geopolitical risk and slowing demand risk mr flynn said
2276988 a few weeks ago when the markets mood was bullish oil would have soared on that pipeline news but supply worries have less impact when the focus and the mood is based on slowing demand
2276989 instead of being born again why not just grow up
2276990 but in shooting we call it the home venue curse
2276991 mother tongue interference and home venue pressure are the biggest obstacles
2276992 but because its the first medal its going to be a stressful situation for everyone
2276993 sonja wont go to the opening ceremonies it wont be easy sleeping though because shes lives near the stadium and there will be lots of fireworks maybe shell have a beer to relax
2276994 cristiano has four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully he will extend it
2276995 he is happy at manchester united and hopefully as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more
2276996 it does happen to players at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2276997 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club
2276998 it is no different leaving london for manchester than portugal you come north you come to a colder climate you come to a wetter climate
2276999 but you also come to a real football city there are very few cities like that
2277000 ronaldo is happy to be a manchester united player he always has been it is just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him however the matter is now closed
2277001 i love playing for my country this is the olympics it doesnt get any bigger and from all my trophies my gold medal is my favourite for me this is as big as the us open
2277002 to win any grand slam would be huge and also the same with the olympics a gold medal in the olympics is something that i think if you look at it over all sports is a big deal for everybody
2277003 within tennis circles i guess winning wimbledon and the us open would be bigger but as an achievement in any sport id say the olympics is right up there
2277004 you look at the field that are here if there was a stage when there was five or six or seven of the top players who werent competing in it then you could say its obviously not too important but as of right now within sport a gold medal is huge
2277005 roger federer is one of the greatest players of all time and hes desperate to win a gold medal if it wasnt such a big deal for tennis players then the top players wouldnt be here its clearly very important to us and thats why all the top guys are here
2277006 ive played really well in the last few months and if i continue to do that then im sure that ill win through a few rounds once you get into the third round quarter final stages anything can happen
2277007 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
2277008 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
2277009 social security numbers credit card numbers and pins are examples of data that should never be compromised today there is an abundance of sensitive and eyes only information that needs to be contained within a secure it environment now more than ever linux system security should be at the top of every business and government agency it checklist
2277010 security blanket is the most comprehensive lock down tool available to help organizations throughout different vertical industries increase their security posture and become compliant and maintain compliancy
2277011 dear yan yan is admitted to xxx hospital i just came back from visiting her
2277012 she has been in high fever for about a week shes suspected to be infected with dengue

2277022 i feel very honored and think its a pleasure to be a volunteer i feel very proud to offer my contribution to the country
2277023 its such an exciting event and its such a big event maybe its the biggest event i have in my life
2277024 the volunteers work very hard and i was moved very deeply the only thing they get is a certificate to prove their identity or a bus card they dont earn salary they dont get paid but they devote themselves to volunteer work
2277025 i taught young children very small children english for half a summer i enjoyed it
2277026 every one of us can be a volunteer if we have the heart of a volunteer
2277027 we should try to do our best to improve the conditions of other people thats our responsibility
2277028 i think we have the heritage from our ancestors and we have the good will to do things for others and not ask for payback and i think thats the essence of community work
2277029 we are professional sailors so we treated it as part of our training programme and feel that we made a clear progression it has been a fantastic regatta and we are really pleased to have won
2277030 this was not in the plan at all but it is very exciting
2277031 if they win tomorrow and we come second we win overall if they win and we come third they win overall
2277032 human trafficking his bangin bod okay really this is mostly what we discussed
2277033 he hung himself and the shower stall was so small he had to squat to get the job done
2277034 the aggressor us army and the central intelligence agency are terrorists and also nurture terror
2277035 tor lets you see what the world looks like from someone elses net connection
2277036 observers could look at the tor servers end to end exit points you have to connect to tor and it downloads a list of the possible tor nodes that you could connect to
2277037 tor is getting really tricky for the chinese to stop because getting a list of all the bridges is almost impossible
2277038 so our wish is that people out there who can spare the bandwidth for open exit and middle nodes will contribute its not something that we can entirely do alone
2277039 when those organisations put out their news what effort are they taking to ensure that other people in china could get access to it
2277040 south ossetia if this isnt war i dont know what is
2277041 russia has always had a strong thirst for power and it is no surprise
2277042 we are pleased to announce today that after more than 75 years of excellent service the planned parenthood rhode island board of directors begins a new chapter of providing reproductive health care in partnership with planned parenthood of connecticut
2277043 the world was watching and i hope they loved it too
2277044 i strongly believe societies that allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2277045 the chinese government and people have seriously implemented the solemn commitments made to the international society since beijing won the olympic bid in 2001
2277046 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2277047 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2277048 we are a freedom loving nation right now under attack
2277049 we urge all the parties including georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate and avoid conflict
2277050 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire
2277051 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2277052 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2277053 there is a threat of even more large scale russian aggression against georgia georgia faces an existential threat amid russian aggression
2277054 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2277055 there should be only one ossetia we want to live with our brothers
2277056 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2277057 we want to give the millions of people who will watch the opening as well as the hundreds of athletes taking part the message that there are no human rights in tibet
2277058 president bush is paving the way for the chinese authorities to further clamp down on religious freedom instead of fostering it as he claims
2277059 the world was watching and i hope they loved it too
2277060 i strongly believe societies that allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2277061 the chinese government and people have seriously implemented the solemn commitments made to the international society since beijing won the olympic bid in 2001
2277062 its completely untrue ridiculous ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2277065 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
2277066 there may be a tightening of belts everywhere but our research suggests that shoppers continue to invest in looking and feeling good
2277067 jeans are the perfect antidote to the credit crunch as they never go out of style and are hard wearing
2277068 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
2277069 if you are experiencing difficulties the advice would be to contact your lender at the earliest opportunity
2277070 our departments have maintained their good performance in terms of responding to requests for information on time and in disclosing information
2277071 this steady flow of information about the business of government will be balanced against the need to protect personal information entrusted to us by the public
2277072 crucial role in ensuring that information about the work of the executive is disseminated proactively
2277073 we are well pleased given the disadvantage that general area has suffered over the decades
2277074 i think its also accessible to everybody and think and hope very much that the southern authorities will make full use of the college and may in due course contribute to its running costs
2277075 he drank in the local pub paddys he just joined in at the bar like a local he didnt want to be seen as a big hollywood star

2277079 hes very good at it he doesnt go too far wrong at any time
2277080 the biggest storm cell i ever saw drifted in over the sperrin mountains and positioned itself over the northern end of the town
2277081 this cell turned the sky dark and developed a powerful rotating updraught called a mesocyclone
2277082 the base of this meso could be seen rotating over the country for 1 5 hours the area of rotation was at least as long as two football pitches
2277083 you may have won this battle windows boy but youll never win the war
2277084 never mind your blind allegiance to the dark empire will be your undoing in the end
2277085 thats right my precious they dont understand you like i do they dont
2277086 instead of being born again why not just grow up

2277088 im from another part of china and ive been sent here to help
2277089 we are all trying to do our best to make this province a better place than before
2277090 i dont know how we could have done it without operation blessing the money that would have gone into building a new home can now go into taking care of my family and children
2277091 when you go into the dining hall and stuff its kind of like being back at a massive school
2277092 i have never seen a village like this it is outstanding
2277093 we dont intend to make a whole lot of friends here the olympic spirit is beating people not living with them
2277094 quite a few of the tennis players are staying in hotels but i dont understand why theyre doing that
2277095 i think youve got to try and get involved with all of the other athletes if you stay in a hotel itll be more like playing the tennis tour whereas i think the olympics is something a bit bigger than that and i was always planning on staying in the village
2277096 we believe that through partnership and open dialogue we can work together to educate children about staying safer online and we look forward to working with organizations like xanga that share our commitment
2277097 xanga has long supported safety measures to help protect its members
2277098 we are taking an approach that empowers the online community to help police the site and protect their privacy this ratings system is yet another innovation like protected posting xanga footprints and xanga lock that gives our users the tools they need to stay safe online
2277099 these conferences give us a chance to listen to law enforcement industry experts families and the social network community about xangas safety features as well as educate them about the importance of responsible behavior by our members
2277100 the united states believe the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2277101 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2277102 im glad i have broad base of support for this campaign
2277103 g eorgia is about coming together working together for all of our diversity for the common good
2277104 i dont think anyone is really surprised that jim martin won but i dont think very many people expected that large of a margin
2277105 im honored that people understand my position and support me because they know my record of trying to make sure that society is fair for all people
2277106 we stood behind him for his long term goals he has had for the glbt community
2277107 he stood with the hiv aids community when we were in the early days of the aids crisis he stood by us during the early days of the defense of marriage act and he will be a wonderful proponent for us in the senate
2277108 the thing about that race is that saxby chambliss is a fairly popular incumbent
2277109 the way ive seen that race is that the candidates the democrats have in the field they dont really have chance of beating chambliss and i still feel that way martin is a nice accomplished solid fellow but i dont think anyone realistically expects him to beat chambliss
2277110 vernon jones politically has been seen as damaged goods for many people for a while
2277111 i think its going to mean a lot barack obamas influence on the race with jim martin in the senate
2277112 even though chambliss has a lot of money barack obama is going to help us with that push for change a lot of voters want change as far as saxby chambliss is concerned too
2277113 she finished fifth in athens and that says she was in the hunt for a medal thats all you can ask for
2277114 shes not a massive climber but i would put my money on nicole to come through that part of the course with a gutsy show she will definitely be in the hunt for a medal
2277115 she had to learn not to be afraid of a man the way in your childhood you learned not to be afraid of an earthworm or a bug often when she spoke to men at parties she rushed things in her mind as the man politely blathered on she would fall in love marry then find herself in a bitter custody battle with him for the kids and hoping for reconciliation so that despite all his betrayals she might no longer despise him and in the few minute remaining learn perhaps what his last name was and what he did for a living though probably there was already too much history between them
2277116 this was a serious vicious and unprovoked assault which resulted in quite serious injury to the victim
2277117 this kind of crime is totally unacceptable and we are making every effort to track down those responsible
2277118 i was in a shop in berlin and this woman refused to serve me when she heard my accent was russian i think they dont like us
2277119 warm salad of cut bulls testicles cooked according to all the rules of russian cuisine
2277120 support for the economic policies of russias vladmir putin are quite strong among older odessans
2277121 putin has improved russias economic development the old people here who grew up being cared for by the state are fearful of the consequences of eu membership and how it will affect their cost of living
2277122 we survived the turks the romanians the poles the war with the nazis the collapse of the soviet union now we have our independence i am optimistic it is the only way we can be
2277123 it appears a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout that contributed to the accident
2277124 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2277125 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2277126 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2277127 so it is probably a good idea to remind users of the dangers of the almighty click
2277128 cybercrooks have already taken advantage of the worlds attention on the beijing games with malware and data thieving phishing attacks
2277129 with the official launch of the olympic games today the number of attacks is likely to increase and continue as the event progresses
2277130 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive

2277139 eliminates right of same sex couples to marry initiative constitutional amendment
2277140 limit on marriage amends the california constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is recognized in california
2277141 uses a strongly negative active tense verb to characterize the effect of the measure and focuses too narrowly on the measures effect on same sex couples
2277142 is an accurate statement of the primary purpose and effect of the measure it is not argumentative or inherently prejudicial
2277143 this argument fails because the attorney general is not required to distinguish between a measures intended consequences purpose and its actual consequences effects
2277144 petitioner admits that the initiative is intended to ensure that same sex couples will not have the right to marry in california thus the court fails to see how it is prejudicial for the attorney general to inform voters of this purpose
2277145 no child can be forced against the will of their sic parents to be taught anything about health and family issues
2277146 its a great thing that ive had the advisors that ive had from the beginning as part of whartons venture initiation program

2277149 what were finding is that human beings are probably driven tremendously by comparison unless you understand those comparisons youre not going to understand the rate of obesity
2277150 understanding the sociology of obesity is much more important than understanding the biology
2277151 they may not be aware of it our computers can trace out these patterns without the individual necessarily knowing them
2277152 their parents got on fine in their life at similar ages weighing many pounds less
2277153 xanga is an industry leader because of its innovative approach and strong commitment to safety
2277154 im looking forward to working with both the xanga team and law enforcement in order to continue to offer xanga users a safe place to express themselves
2277155 what makes this so exciting is that stephen is a real innovator
2277156 his work with the new york attorney generals office was on the cutting edge of internet law were hugely excited to have an innovator like stephen focused 100 percent on the safety of our users
2277157 im thrilled that xanga made such a great choice stephens been involved for many years as a groundbreaker in the cybercrimes and prevention fields hes one of the few who can balance an understanding of legal compliance safety and privacy and the needs of internet users we look forward to working with him
2277158 online risks to children continue to change and require diligent attention to safety precautions xangas hiring of a chief safety officer shows this is a priority area for the company and that they take these issues seriously in june of this year we worked with xanga and others to hold a dialogue on social networking web sites to focus on safety concerns we look forward to building upon that relationship and working with their chief safety officer towards our common goal of keeping online experiences safe and enjoyable for our kids
2277159 its great to see social networking leaders taking the kind of responsibility this development at xanga represents
2277160 there is a bitter fight going on and the significant damage is inflicted on the enemy
2277161 the separatists late thursday evening began intensive firing on georgian villages
2277162 in these conditions in order to guarantee the security of the tskhinvali regions population georgia was forced to take adequate measures
2277163 the actions by georgia in south ossetia bear witness to the fact that the leadership of that country can no longer be trusted
2277164 i sent my beautiful kind loving son to leeds university medical school as a 19 year old teenager they had a basic duty to look after his academic and personal welfare while he studied to become a doctor six years later they sent him home in a body bag
2277165 we aim to provide an environment which fosters education knowledge generation career development and the application of research into clinical practice to improve the quality of life of our students staff and patients
2277166 we aim to provide a unsupportive environment that does not foster education knowledge generation or career development and we aim to destroy our students by protecting tutors who are racist and who bully students this will happen to ensure students toughen up and if they dont toughen up they can just throw themselves out of a window and die when they are sent in a body bag home we can then blame the victim because that is what all institutions do in the uk we know we can get away with this because no one will question or hold us accountable thats because if we just deny anything happened no one will question the internal evidence we will just say its another asian life what does that matter
2277167 the inquest took place on 28 th july 2008 at leeds coroners court despite overwhelming evidence the coroner ruled against the family due to rule 42 which procludes him by law to rule against an institution leading to a pre determined verdict and unfair trial

2277190 the effect is that of a william burroughs situation comedy
2277191 he hated george bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head

2277219 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2277220 weve found that under extreme conditions elite athletes are able to draw on cognitive reserves which allow them to counter the effects of heat stress
2277221 their mental acuity is actually seen to improve a result that is of enormous benefit to competitors in field sports such as hockey
2277222 our findings have been able to offer reassurance to the gb players that their brain functions will not be affected by heat stress
2277223 every games location brings with it its own set of special challenges
2277224 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
2277225 here we found a mutation which affects only the eyes suggesting this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
2277226 it is a wide spectrum of conditions not just one
2277227 the problem is that there is a wide range of underlying defects and we havent got a magic bullet which can target these all at once
2277228 this research is really exciting as it helps our understanding of the genetic basis of cone rod dystrophies in humans
2277229 for the majority of companies if somebody really wants to hack into your system they still can
2277230 but anybody in your network can bring in a wireless access point and plug it in and companies arent able to monitor that as extensively as they should
2277231 youre dealing with hundreds or thousands of machines and applications with dependencies across each other
2277232 this outcome was predetermined not by the court but by the government well before the trial even began
2277233 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2277234 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully

2277236 nothing special about this day and 8230 nothing to worry if something bad has to happen it will happen no matter what the date is
2277237 08 08 08 is eight days after the solar eclipse and eight days before the lunar eclipse people should go about their normal chores but should not do anything auspicious such as starting a new venture or getting engaged or married today
2277238 number 8 is governed by lord shani saturn and his benign influence gives us power independence ambition and organisation 08 08 2008 26 also adding up to 8 which is again influenced by saturn the planet that rules judgement hard work and strong determination
2277239 the triple 8 date has a nice ring to it i dont believe in superstitions but if we do something nice on this day itll be memorable if i get off early today i can take my girlfriend out for a date and the day becomes auspicious for me
2277240 ive always been scared of dates like these when numbers get repeated
2277241 we as the chinese community are really excited about it as the olympics after a very long time is being held in beijing since our ancestors are from there we would hope to see more about it
2277242 may have been akin to those expressed by winston churchill centuries later
2277243 you seem to be willing to dismiss all of conservatism here
2277244 if this were a liberal guy saying he hated conservatives
2277245 this very post seems to endorse the idea that we should blame ann coulter and sean hannity or the fox news channel for the actions of a lunatic
2277246 they arent saying to shoot unitarians or homosexuals or anyone else
2277247 this very post seems to endorse the idea that we should blame ann coulter and sean hannity or the fox news channel for the actions of a lunatic

2277249 gp is interesting to biologists because it can tell us which strategies animals use when foraging the approach works well for very different animals from bees and bats to great white sharks
2277250 he should stand up and say there is something wrong we have to do something its not really fair from him i dont want really to race against a different boat
2277251 frankly if all the races are sailed in four to seven knots wed expect the dutch and americans to be first and second overall so that everyone else would be racing for the bronze
2277252 we were a bit surprised when peacock asked us to use the by catch fish wrappers in the shop but were delighted to be part of the project
2277253 its important for local people to understand a little about the fishing industry
2277254 based on that information we can extract how much force the soldier has received
2277255 we welcome any new initiatives that may help doctors to diagnose and treat brain injuries sustained by soldiers
2277256 however the practical benefits of this research may not be seen for many years if at all
2277257 in the meantime it is vital that every effort is made to accurately diagnose and treat brain injuries sustained from bomb blasts
2277258 our results show both the left and right sides of the rowers hearts are larger and function at an enhanced capacity compared with those of controls
2277259 the causes of this are not completely clear it could be due to the production of growth factors such as igf 1 during training
2277260 people do have different levels of igf 1 naturally although elite athletes do tend to have higher levels
2277261 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2277262 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2277263 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2277264 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2277265 it is important the world recognize that this is justice and not revenge
2277266 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2277267 zealously represented by his defense team the jury made their decision based on the law and the facts presented in court we respect that decision
2277268 we have to be the party of sams club not just the country club
2277269 its meant to be expansive its meant to be inclusive
2277270 people deserve and expect a more effective government at a better price
2277271 one of the greatest leaders the world has ever known
2277272 ideas matter and you have to have ideas that are relevant for these times
2277273 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2277274 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2277275 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
2277276 i just dont think he did it and i dont think the evidence exists
2277277 a good case for continuing the investigation but i think theyre done with it i think theyre burnt and theyve got nowhere to go with it
2277278 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2277279 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2277280 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2277281 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2277282 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2277283 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2277284 are you truly supporting sen obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2277285 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2277286 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2277287 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2277288 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2277289 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
2277290 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2277291 i think its the most extreme measure he can take i dont agree with him
2277292 ze roberto is brilliant he truly shines when given the opportunity its pretty easy to see why he decided not to retire
2277293 i really really want it and i can afford 25 bucks
2277294 we probably had 80 percent of those that were angry
2277295 but i was and am willing to lose the business in order to not be a part of something i dont agree with

2277308 with the introduction of solamet pv159 dupont has again raised the bar for frontside pv cell metallization and were continuing to maximize performance improvements at each account
2277309 they are normally shy and back away so we dont know what happened in this incident
2277310 taking a weird guy and convicting him of mass murder
2277311 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
2277312 they didnt talk about one thing that they got as result of all those searches
2277313 i just dont think he did it and i dont think the evidence exists
2277314 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
2277315 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
2277316 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
2277317 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2277318 we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
2277319 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2277320 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2277321 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2277322 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2277323 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2277324 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2277325 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2277326 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2277327 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2277328 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2277329 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2277330 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2277331 women often are interested in story true emotions and rounded characters
2277332 and often we find action flicks less interesting because they lack those elements
2277333 whats the one thing you need to be successful in your business

2277350 i have the pleasure to send to the host country to the organizers to the participants and most of all to the athletes my cordial regards with the desire that they all give the best of themselves in the genuine olympic spirit
2277351 peace like a river fills my soul when chaos like ocean waves are breaking all around me
2277352 he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed
2277353 he is a manchester united player hes happy to be a manchester united player and hes always been happy here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life that has made it difficult for him
2277354 the important thing is that we have ended all this stuff about real madrid and he will as he gets older appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here they never want to leave
2277355 its unusual for anyone to really want to leave united and i think that cristiano realises that
2277356 we had a good meeting in portugal we clarified a lot of things and thats why i was confident everything was going to be all right
2277357 i think they real now know they are dealing with a different animal and i think cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2277358 he has got four years left on his contract and hopefully at some point we would like to extend it
2277359 i could feel the tiredness invading my bones bleaching my retina and raising a mist on the horizon of my mind

2277363 turbulent storms on the sun generate extremely bright auroral displays but even in quieter times smaller events known as substorms still generate the lights
2277364 the earths environment stores energy then all of a sudden it releases it each substorm generates a current of about one million to two million amps over one to two hours or a total energy equivalent to a magnitude 5 or magnitude 6 earthquake dr angelopoulos said

2277367 i found this better than the male condom or other female contraceptives there is no pain or discomfort in using this
2277368 at first my husband was not sure about it but now even hes come around
2277369 at first these women found the concept of a female condom amusing
2277370 they even laughed at it but now they like it they keep asking me to give them more and more of these
2277371 ive told them that it not only prevents aids but is better for their sexual health
2277372 weve got a sense of freedom of being liberated we feel completely in control
2277373 we first began marketing the female condom primarily among sex workers three years ago
2277374 we then decided to introduce this among rural women since they are also a vulnerable group with little access to public health services
2277375 initially we thought the response would be poor but in fact its been very very good
2277376 itll really help us because the existing ones are not effective
2277377 on the one hand a government body is promoting sexual health among us but on the other we are penalised for expressing our sexuality
2277378 since homosexuality is illegal in the eyes of the law we are frequently harassed by the police
2277379 its all very well to come out with a gay condom but why not change the law
2277380 even companies that already make similar condoms available through the retail network do not brand them as gay condoms they call them super strong condom or powerful condom or stud condoms

2277388 many thinkers however have erroneously equated all human motives with motives found in the animal kingdom this is a mistake because intelligence breeds complexity
2277389 it is easy to understand the mental stimuli in two alley cats squabbling over a scrap of food but it would be a mistake to attribute as simple a state of mind to a terrorist planting a bomb in an airport
2277390 the custodians god clearly did not want mankind to begin traveling the road to spiritual recovery
2277391 god said let us make man in our image after our likeness
2277392 and god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
2277393 the factors responsible for the disappearance of the neanderthal peoples are an important problem to which there is still no clear solution
2277394 god said let us make men in our image after our likeness
2277395 the powerful human drives for spiritual integrity and immortality were twisted into an obsessive quest to preserve bodies
2277396 they came to earth millions of years ago to spread the poison of hatred war and catastrophe
2277397 it crossed a boundary because it said forget the monarchy and that is a political statement why not say forget the republicans
2277398 we are on the watch for these types of things it could be said to be humorous but we felt it was more political than humorous and thats something that we have to protest
2277399 immediate stoppage of work by all members across the industry if the sell off legislation is passed by the lower house of nsw parliament
2277400 some 85 per cent of residents in nsw do not want our energy generators and retailers to be sold off
2277401 we say that he should listen to the public put the sell off to the public let democracy prevail
2277402 the socialist alliance supports the power industry workers who know that some of their work mates will be out of a job if this sale goes ahead we also support their calls for action if anyone is sacked or if the energy bills go through with the support liberal national and shooters
2277403 like many others we dont think that a sale will help shift energy production away from its main power base polluting coal towards the sustainable energy sector to do this requires a political commitment to finding real and lasting solutions to the climate crisis something that this government doesnt have
2277404 if you expect to be a net saver during the next five years should you hope for a higher or lower stock market during that period
2277405 think of it this way even the most devout efficient marketeers rebalance trimming a portfolio back to policy is nothing more and nothing less than a bet on mean reversion

2277412 like countless other central floridians stofko is hunkering down to ride out the economic crisis rather than taking a risk looking for work elsewhere similar decisions to stay put have led to a slowdown in orange countys growth even as central floridas largest county continued to change its complexion and inch toward becoming an area where minorities are the majority

2277424 i assume the u s economy might hit bottom in the second quarter of next year and before we see a recovery we are cautious
2277425 there have been some good catches leading into the olympics its great its showing that it cant be done and other countries are realising it
2277426 youve still got the old guard a lot of the coaches these days are from the era when it was prolific in the sport
2277427 its a matter of changing the morals and the values of these coaches
2277428 i can do the best that i can do knowing that im a clean athlete
2277429 you have to be happy with that to know that you can foot it on the same stage as people that might not be is a great feeling anyway you just take that as part of the sport

2277437 when we have good nose tackles were really really good
2277438 its like someone coming up and slapping you in the face
2277439 when guys were working out i had to sit back and watch
2277440 theyre looking at you like youre getting a break but youre not you want to be out there
2277441 their techniques the way they play the run and their pass rushes
2277442 im trying to steal whatever they have so i can play at their level
2277443 it could be just one thing how vicious they do the rip or how quick their first step was then ill come out the next day and say this is my first step day or my vicious rip day
2277444 he set the example of what a usc nose tackle was really supposed to be all about
2277445 say the center doesnt try to block me i have to get a hand on him to slow him up from getting to the linebacker
2277446 but i dont have to take that block for the next guy i just have to give them a chance to beat the center and i get freed up as well
2277447 i dont think were going to need to because i think averell spicer and christian tupou or one of those other guys are going to be just fine
2277448 ever since ive been here my philosophy is i cant let anybody younger beat me out
2277449 now im the oldest nose tackle so i plan not to let that happen
2277450 based on what statistics you say that a reliable mail hosting should cost more than 70 year
2277451 were just going to use that for our motivation this year weve got like a chip on our shoulder were the big question on the offense
2277452 i remember last year i had to get a shot during training camp to ease the pain
2277453 me and turner are taking a leadership role with the younger guys

2277457 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area
2277458 he took his goal really well and that wont do him any harm

2277465 we have a very simple principle if it doesnt take we stop selling it
2277466 since world war ii america has given the world burger king kfc mcdonalds and pizza hut
2277467 nobody has ever gone to america the home of fast food with a concept that turned out to be a successful national chain we think we can do that
2277468 we have a strong focus on food and a strong entrepreneurial spirit
2277469 some of this stuff goes against the grain of what we do
2277470 how likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague
2277471 single most reliable indicator of a companys ability to grow
2277472 step 1 buy a mac now what were we talking about oh yeah could i get onion rings with that instead of fries
2277473 yeah i swept the floors at a radio station while i was in high school even
2277474 goed zo dat hoort ook met mamas die moet je nat maken en in het water gooien
2277475 en ben je nog heel diep het water in geweest
2277476 maar dat is hartstikke gevaarlijk apie dat mag niet hoor
2277477 echt wel dat geeft wel wat dat geeft heel veel
2277478 nee want dan kan ik als een zombie uit het graf komen
2277479 maar luister apie papa en mama willen gewoon dat je sam blijft en niet een zombie uit een graf
2277480 maar als zombie kun je zo rondlopen en hersens drinken
2277481 apie dat vinden alleen zombies lekker en jij bent toch geen zombie
2277482 en dat rietje stoppen ze zo in je hoofd en dan drinken ze je hersens
2277483 nog 3 nachtjes slapen dan kom je weer bij papa logeren he
2277484 i have not thought about the expectation much on the day i am going out there to perform
2277485 i am looking forward to fighting and we will see how things go hopefully i can put in a good performance
2277486 i am not putting any expectation on myself i know what judo is like it is an unpredictable sport i am going to just take one round at a time and see how it goes
2277487 when i have been on the first day in europeans and i have done well then the rest of the team has done well it would be nice to kick start the judo
2277488 it is a good team everyone has got medals in european and world events but for some reason the olympics have been one of the events we have struggled in
2277489 i dont know why because sometimes the worlds are harder than the games because everyone is there at the worlds at the games it has already been seeded down and people have not made the qualification
2277490 we have video analysis but the only thing i am concentrating on is my own judo i am hoping all my reactions are fast enough
2277491 i know the basics on each person if they are left handed or right handed but i dont sit up watching hours and hours of video on each person thinking what am i going to do to combat this and what i am going to do to combat that
2277492 i prefer to focus on what i am going to do when i get on the mat all i want to be thinking is what i am going to do not what he is going to do otherwise it is going to throw me off too much
2277493 judo is a reaction sport the best players can react to what the opponent is throwing if you are just waiting for him then you are not going to be able to produce your own judo attack is the best form of defence
2277494 its going to be really tough if we come up against an asian fighter
2277495 ive fought in japan before in front of a big crowd but the japanese they appreciate the judo so if youre doing good judo theyll even support you
2277496 we are not really happy about this years olympic program
2277497 the funding from the department of health is hugely significant because it gives a stamp of approval to our approach to providing the best extra care we can and provide people with a life rather than a service

2277506 look into strategic options for the unit notably the entry of funds or strategic partners in its capital
2277507 all the works of man have their origin in creative fantasy what right have we then to depreciate imagination
2277508 a place where the collision of nature and spirit became a reality
2277509 sat in my car looked at the disc and then listened to it song by song making sure there is nothing hidden in it
2277510 what we perceive is not god but his effects rays of light in the first instance and the thick darkness beyond being in the second
2277511 unto this darkness which is beyond light we pray that we may come and may attain unto vision through the loss of sight and knowledge and that in ceasing thus to see or to know that is beyond all perception and all understanding for this emptying of our faculties is true sight and true knowledge and that we may offer him that which transcends all things the praises of a transcendent hymnody
2277512 in proper truth we do but use the elements and syllables and phrases and written terms and words as an aid to our sense inasmuch as when our soul is moved by spiritual energies unto spiritual things our senses together with the thing which they perceive are superfluous when our soul becoming god like meets in the blind embraces of an incomprehensible union the rays of unapproachable light
2277513 alone has immortality and that he dwells in unapproachable light whom no man has seen or can see
2277514 i am the light of the world he who follows me shall not walk in darkness but have the light of life
2277515 you cannot see my face for no man shall see me and live
2277516 here is a place by me and you shall stand on the rock so it shall be while my glory passes by that i will put you in the cleft of the rock and will cover you with my hand while i pass by then i will take away my hand and you shall see my back but my face shall not be seen
2277517 one more thing thank you oh lord for the white blind light thank you oh lord for the white blind light a city rises from the sea i had a splitting headache from which the futures made
2277518 theres no doubt this is a living organism the fact that it can get sick makes it more alive
2277519 the issues statement should not be seen as implying that the cc has identified any competition concerns the cc has yet to reach any conclusions on this inquiry
2277520 one objective is to drive people to our broadcasts but the other is to satisfy the interest and the appetite of the olympic fan who simply cant get enough
2277521 we thought about making the experience as simple as engaging and dynamic as possible
2277522 a turning point in the way that people experience live events and sports in particular online
2277523 definitely its a big pr stunt for microsoft to be able to claim an event like this
2277524 see how popular this guy is he just a celeb with no substance
2277525 huu heb ik iets gemist wat is er morgen dan
2277526 the most unfortunate news we could get for maurice and for his family we feel sorry for everything they have to go through
2277527 weve had some heavily credentialed people with every certificate you can imagine go up on the wall
2277528 the best of the best are at this conference so if theyre getting hit whats happening to the average users
2277529 i dont really care if my system is hijacked and used for a dos attack
2277530 it doesnt really command the same amount of attention as winning a national championship
2277531 we were meant to liaise closely with south west ambulance to develop this role safely
2277532 this has never occurred which makes a mockery of this joint project
2277533 we dont have to try and build it up because its so obvious its crazy
2277534 i think davids got a medal chance in both races but he could be stronger outside the pool
2277535 he could catch a few people by surprise although hes showed hes world class at it the 10k
2277536 in the pool the 1500m is going to be a really hard race there are a lot of guys over eight people who can go under 15 minutes and its going to be a real scrap
2277537 whereas the open water i mean grant hackett wasnt good enough to qualify for it david qualified for it and hackett didnt even though he went for it
2277538 je gaat me toch niet vertellen dat je 5 minuten van je huis vandaan vakantie aan het vieren bent h
2277539 u weet toch dat het zo niet meer werkt op het einpunt dient u de zuil in te vullen met de klacht en dan gaat de monteur kijken of ie vandaag nog tijd heeft
2277540 dat dat ek gezeik eindelijk voorbij is kunnen we weer over leuke dingen praten
2277541 neeeee holy sweet mama als ik ergens een hekel aan heb is het wel aan alles en aan de tour de france in het bijzonder
2277542 niet er is niks moois aan voorovergebukte mannen met een sponsje tussen hun billen en dat nog op een fiets ook bah
2277543 ja gewoon individueel tegen elkaar meppen met die dingen en als je ook maar 1 keer verliest lig je eruit helemaal goed
2277544 had je nog gehoord wat die krajicek de mafkees toen een keer zei
2277545 ja echt lachen he dat zei die toen een keer per ongeluk op televisie terwijl ie chef van de abn amro cup ofzoiets was mooi man
2277546 en is een vrouwelijke tennisser niet eigenlijk een vent met vrouwelijke trekjes
2277547 man bijt taalpurist hij bedoelde vast tennissende vrouwen oftewel tennisters
2277548 en hij had zeker nog nooit van maria sharapova gehoord
2277549 jezus man wie is maria sharapova zon beetje de lekkerste tennister of all time
2277550 hij is stoer omdat ie wimbledon ooit gewonnen heeft ja dat maakt je absoluut 100 stoer voor de rest van je leven maar echt snugger is ie toch echt niet met zulke uitspraken
2277551 hij heeft ten minste een mening ik mag dat wel
2277552 jezus hee je hebt gelijk hoor adolf hitler was niet stoer ondanks dat ie een mening had
2277553 en krajicek ook niet maar weer wel omdat ie wimbledon gewonnen heeft
2277554 en nu ben ik het zat om met jou over sport te praten
2277555 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the ice cream has been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced it and they fell through the baskin administration and the robbins administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these cones are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to sprinkles or crushed butterfingers or antipathy to cones who arent like them or anti cupcake sentiment or anti chocolate sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
2277556 brian and myself have been talking and taking a look at things come november well take a good look at it and see how things are
2277557 i think its important he gets a chance to concentrate on his own game hes been shouldering things for the last five years well see how things go
2277558 you dont win three triple crowns and throw that away too easily at the same time you want to give him a small bit of space it wouldnt be usual to name a captain at the start of a set up
2277559 the delegation is well prepared for the competition as this tournament is definitely the best chance for wushu to display its unique value and charm
2277560 i want to put on a perfect show for the spectators
2277561 in fact my biggest rival in the competition is myself
2277562 at one rehearsal in the birds nest we had 16 players injured in one evening
2277563 one player fell on his head and lost consciousness but his fellow players helped him up and he sustained to the end all of the players stayed at the rehearsal and did not go for medical treatment until they finished the training
2277564 during rainy and foggy weather visibility is not very good this doesnt mean that the air quality is not good
2277565 ik heb een taak op mij genomen een taak uit liefde voor de wereld en om nobele harten te troosten zij die mij dierbaar zijn en de wereld waarnaar mijn hart uitgaat ik bedoel niet de gewone wereld van hen die naar ik gehoord heb geen smart en verlangen kunnen verdragen om in gelukzaligheid te baden moge god hen in gelukzaligheid laten wonen mijn verhaal heeft geen betrekking op hun wereld en manier van leven het leven daarin en het mijne liggen ver uiteen ik denk aan een andere wereld die in n hart de bittere zoetheid en lieve smart de verrukking van het hart en zijn pijn van verlangen dierbaar leven en verdrietige dood dierbare dood en verdrietig leven tezamen brengt laat mij in deze wereld mijn wereld hebben om erdoor te worden verdoemd of gered
2277566 the research indicates that transformation not information drives financial support
2277567 many described the ability to expand their horizons as the heart of the librarys value p 5 6 participants recounted how they discovered a passion for a topic that formed the start of a new career or hobby and ultimately helped them achieve their potential they credited the library with helping form who they are and what they have achieved as adults many credited poignant interactions with their childhood librarians as impacting the direction of their lives some indicated that the library gave them the vision to do better and go further than they might otherwise have been destined for
2277568 the union has made possible progress not only for the working people but advancement in many other directions morally socially and intellectually is traceable to the existence of the organisation of the workers
2277569 morris iemma gave undertakings to a number of electricity unions before the 2007 election that he was not going to privatise the electricity industry and that he was going to provide better services and more services
2277570 now he is privatising an essential service people rely on affordable electricity they rely on electricity that is reliable and they rely on it being available in such a way that they are not paying to prop up the profits of big business and multinationals but that is what we are going to see
2277571 well see price increases that are not going back into the government coffers to provide additional services to the people of nsw but price increases to repay the debt that the private sector takes on to buy or lease these assets
2277572 they are desperately running an ideological agenda being pushed by michael costa to privatise electricity
2277573 but there is still time to convince mps to vote in support of the labor party conference decision they are not in parliament because they are morris iemma or michael costa but because they carry the labor party badge
2277574 i am still hopeful that the government will not be able to push this selloff through
2277575 we have had fantastic support numerous letters emails and telephone calls from our members and from the community against privatisation and in support of our campaign
2277576 the your rights at work groups which were established to take on the howard government are taking on iemma and costa just as strongly which is fantastic all of you should be credited for your enthusiasm commitment and activism
2277577 what the nsw government is proposing is just bad policy privatisation will lead to higher prices and jobs going offshore the proposal does not even look at meeting the shortages in electricity supply that we will face in the future in nsw
2277578 i urge everyone when you leave tonight to contact your member of parliament by email fax or phone put on the pressure and tell them to vote against this legislation it is really important because we need to keep the power industry in our hands
2277579 in the period leading up to the recent alp conference we contacted people from numerous branches and state electorate councils trying to get through anti privatisation motions and trying to get delegates to conference to oppose privatisation
2277580 that campaign was overwhelmingly effective the conference vote was 702 to 107 against privatisation the union delegations voted against privatisation but so did the delegates from electorate councils
2277581 there is no economic sense in selling off this industry
2277582 any guarantees that they are attempting to make around jobs and prices by regulation cannot last because this will not be a service any more if it is privatised it will be a business run for the purposes of profit
2277583 labor members of parliament are in a situation where the caucus has unfortunately voted to proceed with the sale but its our view in the power to the people group that the principle of caucus solidarity does not apply in this situation because the party conference is the supreme body
2277584 electricity is an essential service and it is also essential for the future that we produce electricity in a way that is environmentally sustainable clearly the best way to do that is for public ownership to remain and not for it to be owned by a corporation with an interest solely in profit
2277585 i will continue to oppose the transfer of assets in the parliament and will uphold the labor party platform
2277586 instead of another bass ale how bout i make you a nice swiss miss instant cocoa
2277587 dit is niet echt een slechte eigenschap maar ik kan totaal niet liegen je hebt het gelijk door als ik lieg ik ben er echt sl cht in

2277589 roy kom op we kunnen morgen ook naar het strand dit heb ik er niet voor over
2277590 dat is het niet waard dat is het echt niet waard
2277591 gewoon soms doe je dat om ergens overheen te komen vind je het leuk
2277592 wat zou je doen als hij jou niet leuk vond
2277593 nee roy vind je niet leuk niet op die manier en ook al is er wat gebeurd het is beter dat je niet meer ik dacht het is beter als je het weet
2277594 ik geloof niet in types maar ik denk dat je gelijk hebt
2277595 ik geloof er wel in en je ziet het ook zo duidelijk en hij kent je ook nog maar net
2277596 sorry dat ik jullie onderbreek ik ben zo weer weg

2277600 i cant imagine adidas will be too happy at paying all that money to sponsor the games only to see a rival stepping up to light the olympic flame
2277601 through sports we inspire in people the desire and power to make breakthroughs
2277602 now that we are in different countries we agree more times
2277603 it is always interesting before the season starts to measure yourselves with the top teams in other countries because it gives you a little bit of a view of how well you can do in europe if you qualify
2277604 i think it is very important to play against different philosophies of football and tactics to make things difficult for ourselves in pre season i do not like to win 10 0 i like friendly matches against good teams and to make it difficult for ourselves it is a pit we dont play arsenal
2277605 is he feeling the pressure you have to ask him scolari

2277620 the january 2005 inauguration was marred by the exclusion of thousands of people who were denied access because the national park service had attempted to turn pennsylvania avenue into the private domain of the bush cheney presidential inaugural committee as a result of our lawsuit people may have additional opportunities to access the inaugural parade including those who hold an anti war view but this is an unfinished struggle and the litigation is still ongoing
2277621 the national park service has operated as a political entity and has eagerly violated the constitution repeatedly in its attempts to limit visible dissent at this historic event that belongs to the public at large including those who dissent from u s war policy

2277671 ons leven in arolsen was zeer eenvoudig dat is gelukkig voor kinderen we leerden uitstekend handwerken ook tekenen ik herinner me toen we in cannes logeerden kreeg ik daar goede tekenlessen en franse literatuur van een fransman onze opvoeding was breed voor die tijd vader las veel vooral wetenschappelijke werken daaruit vertelde hij ons maar de praktijk van de opvoeding berustte bij onze moeder heel jong al hielpen we mee in haar liefdadigheidswerk als we op reis waren schreven we brieven voor moeder was er wel aan gedacht om hier soep te brengen daar kinderkleertjes thuis gingen we naar de mensen toe informeerden en brachten nodige dingen
2277672 ze voelde zeer sociaal ze sprak met ons over arbeidsverhoudingen sociale instellingen het leven van de fabrieksarbeiders toen meestal nog zeer treurig ze gaf niet alleen lessen ze schiep ook een sfeer om ons onderwijs daar is een kind nog het meest gevoelig voor de indrukken die men in zijn jeugd opneemt worden zeer waarschijnlijk later tot je richtsnoer
2277673 een groot voorrecht een groot gezin een natuurlijke hulp bij de opvoeding je voedt elkaar op je leert toegeven niet je wil doordrijven achterstaan ter wille van een ander we gingen niet zo heel veel met anderen om dat hoeft ook niet als je zelf een grote kring vormt aan tafel met de gouvernante de gouverneur de kinderjuffrouw moeders twee hofdames waarvan n ons meisjes chaperonneerde als we uitgingen mijn broers vriendje dat met hem opgevoed werd waren we zo toch iedere dag met veertien personen samen dat brengt gezellige conversatie mee

2277683 a congressional committee notified the food and drug administration yesterday that as a result of a recall by medtronic of a product linked to patient deaths it was reviewing how rigorously the agency required heart device components to be tested in a letter to the agency representative henry a waxman democrat of california and chairman of the committee on oversight and government reform asked agency officials a series of questions about its oversight of leads the wires that carry electrical information between an implanted defibrillator and the heart among other issues mr waxman asked the agency to provide information about how it determines how much to test leads before marketing and why the agency does not give leads the same scrutiny that it has given in recent years to defibrillators

2277706 i have always stayed away from doping and that is why i was selected to represent my country everyone knows there are various international tests for catching dope cheats and no sensible athlete will ever do it
2277707 i am ready to go to beijing and face the dope test if i fail there shoot me in public
2277708 i had no clue about the test result it was only revealed to me a couple of hours before i was to board the flight it is a premeditated move by those who are trying to make a case for pujari due to regional allegiance
2277709 i dont know which tests they are talking about these tests are invalid and we are firmly behind devi
2277710 even from the beginning i was taller and heavier and thats how we picked our positions
2277711 its one boat and a pair of people so it doesnt matter as much that were brothers it always has to be a team to co operate and to be friends
2277712 its been extremely hot and that probably played a part
2277713 wed noticed in training he was not sweating the way he should
2277714 when trying to make weight these kids sometimes cut corners we believe he did not increase his fluid intake the way we had told him to
2277715 the bush administration responding to a wave of recent food and product recalls is set to announce today its most aggressive regulatory proposals yet on policing imports but much of their success depends on congressional action and some lawmakers and outside experts already contend they are inadequate the initiative aims to steer the nation toward a prevention based regulatory system that targets the riskiest products it calls for giving more authority to agencies that regulate food and consumer goods improving data gathering on imports and increasing cooperation between agencies and with u s trading partners the food and drug administration for example would be granted power to require manufacturers and importers of high risk products to take steps to prevent contamination and other problems the fda could require producers and importers of such goods to certify they comply with fda standards the fda could bar imports if it is given no access or only limited access to production records the agency would also be able to mandate recalls on tainted products something it cant do now
2277716 the post registers real intent was to smear the scouts good name and take away what the scouts value most their honor
2277717 im not bashing the choice to republish or asking for a doctrinal reason for it
2277718 if the only perfect man who ever lived even jesus of nazareth was called upon to endure great suffering how can we who are less than perfect expect to be free of such challenges

2277720 f rom an address given by president benson at the ground breaking service for a chapel in hyrum ohio 22 march 1986
2277721 this important address was published in the july 1978 ensign at the direction of the president it is reprinted for renewed individual and family study
2277722 this important address was delivered at the april 1978 general conference at the direction of the president it is reprinted for renewed individual and family study
2277723 this message is reprinted from previous addresses by president kimball with his permission and blessing
2277724 due to the dishonesty and shady sales tactics that i saw take place day in and day out
2277725 when a single guy comes in you focus solely on engine performance power how much of a lady magnet it is or how much mud you can sling with it
2277726 with a lone female you want to hit on the safety factors options available roominess and how much fun it would be to haul the girls around in it
2277727 for younger married couples most of the time you focus on any rebates and savings available and its worth mentioning a family type of vehicle for future plans when a salesman is up against two people its always a bit more difficult because of the hero factor whenever two people come in one of them is usually designated the hero because their sole purpose is to try to beat the salesman
2277728 automatically on the salesmans team because they are just as determined to drive off the lot in a new car as the salesman is
2277729 the promise of a bargain price is designed to create a sense of urgency the feeling that if you dont grab this special sale price right now it will forever disappear lots of buyers fall for that
2277730 analytical buyers pay less for their new cars than emotionally charged buyers
2277731 if a salesperson is truly dedicated to customer service then the customers will eventually buy from that salesperson
2277732 een aantal saunasessies geleden vroeg ik aan hem hoe hij heette terwijl ik dat eigenlijk al wist maar nog nooit uit zijn mond had gehoord hij noemde zijn naam en hetgeen wat al wist werd bevestigd ik noemde mijn naam en vanaf die dag noemen waren we mensen die elkaars naam kenden
2277733 vandaag kwam ik niet opgang na vijf minuten wilde ik de handdoek al in de ring gooien
2277734 jij schrijft toch af en toe wat schrijf je voor iets
2277735 we need to allow local property owners to decide what type of business they have rather than have the social elite professional do gooders and what i refer to as behavior nazis decide for us how we are going to live and this is what is happening right now
2277736 mevrouw vind u het verstandig om hier stil te blijven staan

2277738 wat opvalt aan de eerste tekeningen met de manifestatiehal is het futuristische karakter
2277739 what was the most amount of money you ever spent on something
2277740 they come back to life because their cosmos are just too big to be believed i guess
2277741 it couldnt have stormed any harder than it did during our ceremony
2277742 theres a huge crack of thunder like you better think twice about that
2277743 i never would have thought that having a terrible thunderstorm during the wedding would be a good thing
2277744 dan was laughing about it after he got back from the e r thanks to the pain medication but it took me a few days to see the humor in it
2277745 you have the image in your head but nothings exactly as you imagine it to be
2277746 its my job to make sure they dont know what goes wrong
2277747 you have to change the way you look at things
2277748 you cant look at problems as disasters but as humorous incidents
2277749 if people go into the day with that perspective they can have a good time
2277750 if people spent as much time on their marriages as they do planning their wedding the divorce rate would be much lower
2277751 i thought things are going to happen no matter how well you plan some things are going to happen that you have no control over
2277752 as long as we end up married at the end of this day thats what counts
2277753 looking back on this i would not change a thing about it
2277754 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2277755 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
2277756 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2277757 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
2277758 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
2277759 everyone feels secure in their jobs until they get handed a pink slip
2277760 but putting the job aside what if their furnace or ac unit breaks big costs like that are always a possibility
2277761 wed be through our savings before the month was out if one of us lost a job
2277762 after my outburst a male engineer reiterated my point and everyone listened to him of course
2277763 we found that the women on the tapes who were judged as angry lost out in every category
2277764 when women express anger at work no matter what they do on the job they can be seen as out of control or are viewed in a negative light
2277765 i went off and as my rant proceeded i moved farther and farther across the table until i was stretched out about as far as i could without lying on the table
2277766 i walked out into the newsroom which was dead quiet and hurled the tape cartridge as hard as i could against the wall screaming when is someone going to fix the cart machines
2277767 where i used to work women were almost rewarded for their ability to stand up for themselves showing the moxie to work in a fast paced tight deadline newsroom
2277768 when i am brought in to coach someone on the job i think of them as a blank slate
2277769 there are many reasons why people get angry on the job or react to situations or colleagues
2277770 i like to think i was given a little bit of a pass because this incident notwithstanding i was a friendly easygoing coworker
2277771 when you make a statement like women who get angry at work are seen as less competent or men are allowed to be angry at work i think it just reinforces negative stereotypes
2277772 i dont think there is a kind of behavior solely exhibited by men or women
2277773 the power of a good fight how to embrace conflict to drive productivity creativity and innovation
2277774 i always tell women on the job kill them with kindness
2277775 we have to reach out to those we need and who may need us yet we strive for self reliance
2277776 how do we solve these complex challenges the answer is special care and attention in this great hour of need we have to have targeted strategies to target price increases less energy dependence self sustainability self independence and self reliance
2277777 we have our disagreements but we are one nation with one fate as your president i care too much for this nation to let anyone stand in the way of the peoples well being i will let no one threaten our nations survival we must be there for them now
2277778 the philippines is truly diverse yet united by a strong leap of faith in the future
2277779 we are not victims of life we can learn to remove ourselves as victims of life letting go
2277780 it was impossible in my mind that osama bin laden would be behind it
2277781 my view and my thinking had changed completely it was big shock for me when someone had treated you with respect and regard and then you realize what they were up to
2277782 it was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed i dont know what could be given or presented to these innocent people who were killed in the u s
2277783 i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
2277784 he is free with his family right now with his children
2277785 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2277786 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2277787 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2277788 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2277789 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2277790 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2277791 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2277792 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2277793 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue
2277794 a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular hard working people
2277795 dat heeft alles te maken met de belastingen in nederland
2277796 als we de belastingaangifte in de bus krijgen worden wij rood van woede
2277797 als we vervolgens het te betalen bedrag lezen trekken we wit weg
2277798 om ons dan ook nog een keer blauw te betalen
2277799 bij ons is dat precies hetzelfde alleen zien wij er nog sterretjes bij

2277805 onze subsidieaanvraag voor het wad en dollardcentrum wordt door het waddenfonds als ontvankelijk beschouwd de brief is binnen een kopie heb ik vrijdag naar winschoten gestuurd
2277806 de zorgen zijn de wereld nog niet uit maar toch het lijkt erop dat het licht op groen komt
2277807 het is onderdeel van onze plannen voor een watereducatiecentrum daar is ook zaalruimte aan toegevoegd
2277808 winschoten had mee kunnen liften jammer dat het zo gaat de discussie over de bouw van een evenementenhal is te zeer op winschoten zelf gericht maar goed dit gaat om het wad en dollardcentrum en niet om de manifestatiehal
2277809 why are we painting the walls the colors of pee and poo
2277810 ik ben vol vertrouwen dat dit ook de gedachte van mijn mening versterkt ehhh ook dat zo denk ik dit mij veel oplevert voor ook de popu poll misschien haal ik wel 43 procent
2277811 great commentary jim dont worry about those who lack a discerning irish or british sense of humour your wit is lost on them im really enjoying your observations
2277812 its nice to see a bit of tongue in cheek humour much better than the beijing broadcasting coporations coverage
2277813 everything you have written are either negative or are very very prejudiced
2277814 im watching the ceremony online yes im in america the networks dont own the net your negative views about the event is no way a representation of the art and powerful display of the chinese people no where in the western world would a show like this be possible it is the most amazing thing i have seen and display of technology and human performance
2277815 your political views are very obvious and quite valid even if they are not expressed but all the sarcastic and jaded comments cannot in any way diminish what is a fantastic and almost unbelievable spectacle that the chinese have put on for the opening ceremony do i detect a large element of jealousy do make sure to remember all your sarcastic comments as they will certainly be needed for the english attempt at an olympic ceremony in a few years the words
2277816 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2277817 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2277818 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2277819 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
2277820 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2277821 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2277822 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it
2277823 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2277824 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2277825 maybe youre a gruff looking guy but a softy on the inside as evidenced by your fluffy poodle or pampered yorkshire and youre perfectly comfortable with your dogs demeanor and secure about your preference
2277826 perhaps your refined elegance and business pedigree doesnt quite match up with your scruffy looking terrier or rowdy jack russell so you cant always judge a book by its cover but the type of dog certainly may reveal who the person is within or what they aspire to be
2277827 while many women will contend that they simply enjoy putting a cute coat on their dog many men will view that woman as high maintenance
2277828 now not every man will be scared off by that but to many men that screams that the woman will spend spend spend their money and that they prefer designer brands over generic
2277829 even though dogs have 220 million smell receptors to our 5 million im not talking literally sniff ing you a good date but trust your dogs instincts
2277830 look for the receptiveness of your dog being comfortable around your potential date
2277831 so take your dog with you everywhere you can in order to meet people and pause when in view of a potential date to make yourself available for small talk
2277832 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
2277833 i think it would be premature to jump out there and say exactly what may have happened
2277834 we know one contributing factor would be that it appears that a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout and that certainly contributed to the accident
2277835 i was sitting right below the tv and i felt like somebody was laying on my leg right next to me there was a lady who got her arm really crushed up
2277836 on top of her there was another lady she could not move

2277840 haremos el pastel para que pap sepa que lo queremos
2277841 tuve que decidirlo sola har una tarta de cordero usted est muy ocupada con su escritura nadie me dio instrucciones
2277842 hay que mirar la vida de frente y conocerla por lo que es amarla por lo que es es el derecho de todo ser humano
2277843 la misma frase que su madre ya pronunciara en el coche para tranquilizarlo justo el d a en el que seg n la conmovedora confesi n de la escena final sta ha decidido ya la estrategia de su huida es decir de su desaparici n muerte como figura materna
2277844 t u decidiste que yo pod a ser feliz en esta tranquilidad a m me han robado la vida yo tambi n vivo la amenaza de mi extinci n vivo una vida que no deseo llevar no se puede encontrar la paz evitando la vida desear a ser feliz por ti
2277845 tengo que enfrentarme a las horas y despu s a las horas que siguen a stas debes dejar que me vaya he seguido vivo por ti tendr s que pensar en ti misma cuando me muera
2277846 tengo que enfrentarme a las horas y despu s a las horas que siguen a stas
2277847 tu t a es muy afortunada por que tiene dos vidas la que vive y la que escribe
2277848 creer en la muerte es un alivio porque se sabe que el dolor puede terminar es posible morir
2277849 hay veces en las que uno no encaja y piensa que se va a matar pero no se atreve
2277850 hay que mirar la vida de frente siempre mirarla de frente y conocerla por lo que es amarla por lo que es y luego ponerla en su sitio
2277851 bij een ironische situatie vindt het tegenovergestelde plaats van wat verwacht zou worden leg uit wat er ironisch is aan het feit dat er in een straatarm land als roemenie veel beren voorkomen dankzij de jacht
2277852 go into all the world and preach the good news to everyone everywhere
2277853 if it is to be it is up to me
2277854 ja ik wil nee wij willen gezellig met een stel vrienden vriendinnen een hapje eten en een drankje drinken en dan neem ik mn beste humeur mee en ik kom graag naar st willebrord om te kijken hoe klein en bescheiden onze jos en diane tegenwoordig wonen
2277855 u heeft een acute darmontsteking nee we kunnen nu niet opereren nederland speelt
2277856 dit is de voicemail van 112 momenteel zitten wij voetballen te kijken maar probeer het gerust nog eens na de nabeschouwing
2277857 boodschappen ja ik weet dat het koopavond is maar alle caissi res zijn voetballen aan het kijken net als de vakkenvullers
2277858 koken voor de bewoners van het verzorgingstehuis kom nou er is voetbal op tv en een mens kan best een dagje zonder eten
2277859 gij zult tijdens de dwaze dagen niet zeggen maar je hebt toch al vul hier een kledingstuk in
2277860 het schandaal van de kerk is dat wat christus heeft gedaan niet meer levensveranderend is maar levensverbeterend we hebben de kracht en vreugde verloren die echte discipelen voortbrengt en we zijn verworden tot religieconsumenten
2277861 de duivel zei tegen haar we moesten op jouw morele gevoelens inwerken om je angst weg te nemen
2277862 maar dat kan niet want er staat helemaal niet zoveel geld op de rekening van deze mevrouw
2277863 dan storten wij het verschuldigde bedrag eerst op rekening van de mevrouw en dan moet de nota vervolgens betaald worden
2277864 zullen we een stukje gaan fietsen ergens waar we normaal nooit komen
2277865 er zit wel vreemd veel ijzer in deze wijn ik hoop dat je daar van houdt
2277866 als jullie je aan mijn geboden houden blijven jullie in mijn liefde
2277867 want de wet van de geest die het leven brengt door de eenheid met christus jezus heeft u bevrijd van de wet die zonde en dood brengt
2277868 technisch gezien zijn we als christenen niet meer onder de wet van mozes maar onder de genade de wet van christus toch zie je dat paulus de wet van mozes aanhaalt waarom doet hij dat onder beide zijn veel dezelfde dingen toepasbaar als voorbeeld
2277869 tijden het oude verbond wet van mozes was de straf van een overtreding de dood ef 18 20 met lijden als resultaat nu we niet meer onder de wet van mozes leven maar onder de genade worden we niet gestrafd als we een overtreding maken
2277870 the fate of musharraf now lies in the hands of chief of army staff general ashfaq kiyani
2277871 they will have their concerns but having concerns is one thing and sending in the tanks is quite another
2277872 he does not have the courage to face the elected representatives
2277873 as the country is facing a critical situation it would be inappropriate to impeach the president
2277874 we are seven senators in the group and would decide a joint course over the issue soon
2277875 it is a step towards democracy and parliamentary sovereignty we are just implementing the mandate given to us by the public on february 18
2277876 during the whole day russian jet planes have been continuously attacking georgian towns
2277877 they have been continuously attacking the town of gori in the middle of georgia which has nothing to do with south ossetia
2277878 russia cannot allow georgia to solve the south ossetia problem by military means
2277879 of course the deaths of russian peacekeepers and the destruction caused by the invading georgians is an important reason why medvedev has ordered russian forces to intervene in the conflict but there are bigger strategic reasons behind that moscow cannot let saakashvili succeed in his gamble
2277880 it happened so fast i didnt have time to be scared
2277881 it is absolutely clear that this was a long planned offensive by georgia against south ossetia not a spontaneous action
2277882 but the entry of russian forces into the conflict is a worst nightmare scenario georgian leaders may have thought they could achieve a quick fait accompli but now we are looking at the specter of a long conflict with much destruction and many victims
2277883 we call on all sides including georgians south ossetians and russians to bring tensions down to avoid bringing about a conflict
2277884 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia he said
2277885 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armored vehicles started to cross the georgian border
2277886 and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2277887 it is my duty as president of the russian federation to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they may be
2277888 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2277889 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2277890 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2277891 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2277892 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2277893 to stop the ball on that green when theres a lot of breeze from behind that was good
2277894 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
2277895 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
2277896 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
2277897 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
2277898 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
2277899 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure
2277900 can win a stage race for clean production capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy
2277901 the project is under progress we do not yet have any timeframe for launch
2277902 do you think somebody would actually put millions of dollars into making a car that will not pass safety regulations theres no point in doing that
2277903 i dont think we should discount this advance if it happens
2277904 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous

2277908 de eigenheden van architectuur op mimetische wijze inzetten om een kritische omgang te ontwikkelen met verleden heden en toekomst
2277909 because i had to fast i cant do anything else
2277910 because i couldnt find a food which i enjoyed if i had found that believe me i would not have made a spectacle of myself and would have eaten to my hearts content like you and everyone else
2277911 not just in commerce but in the world of ideas too our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid
2277912 i can go sit in a garage all day and it wont make me a car so going and sitting in church every sunday isnt going to make me a christian
2277913 de eigenheden van architectuur op mimetische wijze inzetten om een kritische omgang te ontwikkelen met verleden heden en toekomst
2277914 onvermijdelijk spelen tegenstrijdige inzichten en belangen een rol in elke architecturale verwezenlijking het gehalte van een ontwerp kan slechts worden afgemeten aan de mate waarin het erin slaagt te bemiddelen tussen al deze tegenstrijdigheden in de mimetische vormgeving van het project zonder deze spanningen te loochenen door ze op te lossen in grijze middelmatigheid
2277915 i have dont have much of a routine with god but i get by
2277916 is this really what the debate has already degenerated to the question obama already has to answer is some have suggested that you may be the anti christ is this true or just politics as usual

2277928 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2277929 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2277930 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2277931 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2277932 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2277933 i put about 20 films in development at lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2277934 i really dont want to be doing this i dont want to hold his mans testicles and i dont want to be near his anus and im not sure how i got to this point in my life where this is actually my job this is what i get paid for i have chosen to do this
2277935 na vier jaar stond ik voor de lastige keus om terug te keren naar de pati ntenzorg of verder te gaan met medische geschiedenis uiteindelijk heb ik gekozen voor een baan als universitair docent bij cultuurwetenschappen in maastricht en sinds 1998 ben ik hoogleraar geschiedenis der geneeskunde bij het vu medisch centrum ik heb geen moment spijt gehad van mijn keus
2277936 ik raakte zo verstrikt in het biochemisch onderzoek dat de stap terug naar de medische praktijk te groot was maar in die tijd heb ik ook mijn interesse in de geschiedenis van de geneeskunde met name van de zeventiende eeuw en de introductie van de westerse geneeskunde in azi verder verdiept
2277937 ik kreeg een aanstelling als student assistent en een budget om nieuwe aanschaffen te doen ik heb nog wel wat co schappen gelopen en mijn doctoraal gehaald maar kon in 1978 al op mijn 26ste hoogleraar medische geschiedenis lindeboom opvolgen aan de vu
2277938 die hebben een heel andere manier van kijken en denken dan wij drie n niet minder waardevol maar je kunt hen geen college laten geven over de geschiedenis van het hart wel bijvoorbeeld over de sociale positie van de vroedvrouw in de middeleeuwen
2277939 wij zitten er in de eerste plaats voor studenten die arts willen worden en er niet voor gekozen hebben om met geschiedenis geconfronteerd te worden ik zal de eisen van mijn vak dan ook nooit overdrijven als het me lukt om even dat historische antennetje uit te trekken bij een student is mijn missie geslaagd
2277940 omdat ik de huidige fysiologie anatomie en pathologie ken kan ik bepaalde zaken toch makkelijker uitleggen aan studenten en door de biochemie ben ik getraind in een striktere vorm van wetenschappelijk denken het is ook heel handig om een tijdje te hebben rondgesnuffeld in een laboratorium daardoor begrijp ik beter hoe in de negentiende en begin twintigste eeuw allerlei ontwikkelingen in de geneeskunde vanuit de labsetting plaatsvonden
2277941 het scheelt enorm als je begrijpt wat er omgaat in het hoofd van een dokter in de spreekkamer artsen zijn heel praktische mensen die gericht zijn op het oplossen van een probleem dat doen ze met in hun achterhoofd wat wetenschappelijke noties en verder een groot aantal vaardigheden voorgeschreven handelingsscenarios die ze in hun opleiding hebben meegekregen daar groeien ze in op en houden ze ook het grootste deel van hun leven aan vast vernieuwingen sijpelen daardoor maar langzaam door daar gaat vaak een generatie overheen
2277942 ik merk vaak dat historici koudwatervrees hebben om in die medische praktijk te treden om te kijken wat een dokter doet en waarom welke technieken hij inzet hoe hij een diagnose stelt en juist die ene therapie kiest daardoor blijft de geneeskunst een soort black box in veel geschiedschrijving ik heb juist wel de neiging om daar in te duiken
2277943 voor de komst van de ecg bestond het hartinfarct niet als klinisch beeld men had angina pectoris of men ging dood aan hartzwakte het infarct als ziektebeeld waarbij de arteria coronaria worden afgesloten zuurstofgebrek ontstaat en necrose van het hartweefsel met fatale afloop dat syndroom kende niemand rondom de ecg heeft zich een heel specialismeontwikkeld zon soort verhaal kun je over bijna elke nieuwe techniek vertellen
2277944 sommige gynaecologen waren daar zeer bedreven in nu verstaan hooguit vroedvrouwen die kunst nog
2277945 met de komst van de stethoscoop de bloeddrukmeter en de ecg is dat helemaal verdwenen in mijn opleiding kreeg je dit niet meer vernieuwing levert dus niet alleen winst op maar ook verlies
2277946 het is beslist geen rariteitenkabinet dat wel gemist kan worden in het computertijdperk wel moetje de collectie zo tentoonstellen dat die uitnodigt om ernaar te kijken
2277947 aan die oude stukken kun je toch meer zien dan op een plaatje of een beeldscherm neem zon ingewikkeld proces als de embryologie van het centrale zenuwstelsel dat kun je het beste driedimensionaal aanschouwelijk maken de basisvakken zoals anatomie embryologie en fysiologie staan toch al onder druk in het huidige onderwijscurriculum het inzicht dat de bouwen de werking van het lichaam algemene wetmatigheden en samenhang kent gaat verloren als je het onderwijs opsplitst in drie weken maag darm drie weken long enzovoorts beukers is niet gerust op de toekomst van zijn vakgebied in leiden
2277948 mijn positie is slechter dan vroeger de raad van bestuur wilde de leerstoel medische geschiedenis een tijd geleden zelfs opheffen
2277949 het gaat er maar net om welke visie je hebt op het onderwijs of je medisch technici wilt opleiden of mensen met een wat bredere visie
2277950 we denken wel dat de ontwikkelingen in de geneeskunde allemaal zo dynamisch verlopen maar vooruitgang kan soms hard tegenvallen we zijn altijd onderweg dat wil ik laten zien aan studenten beukers ergert zich aan vooringenomenheid bijvoorbeeld als het gaat om alternatieve geneeskunde
2277951 studenten willen daar terecht meer over weten want daar krijgen ze straks vragen over van pati nten je moet ze leren om daar een fatsoenlijk standpunt over in te nemen dat ze niet zomaar roepen dat het allemaal onzin is je hoopt dat mensen met een universitaire opleiding wat opener staan ten opzichte van de wereld en niet te veel vanuit a priori standpunten redeneren die openheid aankweken is mijn ideaal als docent soms neem ik bij colleges met opzet een extreem standpunt in en doe ik stellige uitspraken om die dan een week later onderuit te halen
2277952 beukers beseft dat de tijdgeest wat dat betreft ongunstig is
2277953 er is een desintegratieproces gaande binnen de universiteit de samenhang van de universiteit als geheel is geleidelijk aan het oplossen en je ziet ook dat faculteitsleden zich steeds minder verantwoordelijk gaan voelen voor hun faculteit
2277954 het onderwijs aan studenten geneeskunde en gezondheidswetenschappen in het basiscurriculum is van hoge kwaliteit en we hebben veelonderzoeksprojecten gefinancierd uit de tweede en derde geldstroom maar het is wel zo dat een afdeling als de onze altijd extra moet opletten en haar bestaansrecht moet verduidelijken
2277955 voor de eerste cursus die dit voorjaar van start is gegaan hebben we vooral geworven onder studenten geneeskunde gezondheidswetenschappen en letteren met succes we hebben zelfs enkele studenten moeten afwijzen omdat de limiet van vijftien al bereikt was
2277956 ze denken dat ze klaar zijn als ze de feiten op een rijtje hebben gezet terwijl de problematisering daarvan en de compositie van het verhaal net zo belangrijk zijn
2277957 we moesten te veel tijd steken in het bijbrengen van basis beginselen daarom is promoveren voortaan alleen nog mogelijk met een masterdiploma op zak
2277958 ik heb hier bijna alle nederlandse medische proefschriften staan alle jaargangen van het nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde een portrettencatalogus van alle nederlandse medici
2277959 boeken te veel om op te noemen en er is voortdurend nieuwe aanwas bijvoorbeeld via ziekenhuizen die verdwijnen en hun bibliotheek aan mij afstaan er staan hier nog zes pallets met boeken die ik moet invoeren
2277960 het vak medische geschiedenis is in nederland heel lang bedreven door ge nteresseerde clinici zoals lindeboom de moulin en luyendijk die hebben heel verdienstelijk werk gedaan maar publiceerden toch vooral over hun hobbys er zat geen systematiek in als lindeboom een bepaald feit niet direct kon naslaan in zijn bibliotheek liet hij het veelal gewoon zitten
2277961 ik heb er van meet af aan voor gekozen om het vak van de instrumenten te voorzien waarmee je gedegen historisch onderzoek kunt doen ik heb een documentatiecomplex mijn onderzoek heeft een sterk empirisch karakter gericht op bronnen een beetje duits
2277962 surprised by hope evangelism in response to readers comments part 1 5
2277963 t is dat we al geen wissels hebben anders zou het wel anders zijn
2277964 de kerk is de voorloper van een verzoening die kosmis en universeel is de wereldwijde gemeenschap van gelovigen is bedoeld als een microkosmos in welke het goddelijke doel van het terugwinnen van de volledige schepping al zichtbaar is en door welke het doel verder komt als dit de taak van de kerk is dan is het belangrijk dat christenen helpen de kerk te maken tot een plek van heling van gebroken relaties waar verschillen tussen klassen ras rijkdom intellect leeftijd sekse nationaliteit of religieuze tradities zijn overwonnen de kerk is zo een agent van vrede en rechtvaardigheid in situaties van conflict

2277978 ik heb heel erg lang hoop gehouden doordat ik in deze lang periode geen communicatie met haar had werd zij voor mij een mythe
2277979 het heftigst had ik de pijn gedurende een maand maar nu na 4 jaar denk ik nog steeds aan haar zij zit zowel voor wat betreft de mooiste als voor de minste momenten in mijn ziel
2277980 ik wist dat het niet meer goed zou komen juist het gebrek aan hoop maakte dat ik zoverdrietig was hoop is vaak de tegenhanger van rouw dan ontduik je dat nog enigszins
2277981 het heftigst had ik de pijn gedurende een maand maar nu na 4 jaar denk ik nog steeds aan haar zij zit zowel voor wat betreft de mooiste als voor de minste momenten in mijn ziel

2277998 hey so i saw this thing on the news this morning something about a dow its low or something i mean whatever it is it must be obscure because i havent even heard of it
2277999 de belangrijkste redenen hiervoor zijn de afwezigheid van een goede en beoefende procedure vermissing eigen personeel en het feit dat brandweerofficieren niet geselecteerd opgeleid en geoefend zijn om juist in een dergelijke situatie als brandtechnisch manager het verschil te maken

2278007 hoe weet jij dat je de ziekte van huntington zult krijgen
2278008 in plaats van een wetenschappelijke uitleg te geven over het aantal cag herhalingen repeats zeg je eenvoudig dat de dokter een bloedtest heeft gedaan en heeft gevonden dat je het ziekmakende gen hebt
2278009 er bestaat een kans dat jij deze ziekte krijgt maar er is ook kans dat jij het niet krijgt
2278010 wel toen ik het destijds hoorde over huntington maakte ik me echt wel zorgen en dat is normaal we kunnen de ziekte nog niet genezen maar we kunnen iedereen die bang is ondersteunen mocht je je dus ooit zorgen maken kom dan met me praten

2278024 maar ik heb beloofd om in ieder geval tot half mei bij het hof te blijven
2278025 dit is toch een geweldige kans dit moet je gewoon accepteren mits je het zelf wilt natuurlijk
2278026 joh als zij je niet meer willen zetten je ze ook zo buiten de deur
2278027 nu wil ik graag dat je over 2 weken begint hoe ga je dat doen
2278028 ik heb een afspraak gemaakt bij het hof en daar wil ik me graag aan houden ik heb tot minimaal half mei toegezegd en ik vind dat ik ze dat verplicht ben sorry maar het hof is me t dierbaar en ik hou er niet van om dit soort afspraken op deze manier te verbreken als u snel iemand nodig heeft zult u naar iemand anders op zoek moeten

2278031 eh laten we er in ieder geval morgen op terugkomen
2278032 dan kan wondelgijn er over nadenken we overvallen haar tenminste met dit voorstel denk ik en wij kunnen dan ook nog even overleggen of wij met deze voorwaarden overeen komen
2278033 het zijn nog maar kinderen ze hebben recht op een onbezorgde jeugd

2278035 we laten ze er beter zoveel mogelijk buiten en ook de anderen want anders worden ze misschien uitgelachen door hun vriendjes en in de buurt
2278036 we doen best zo lang mogelijk of er niets aan de hand is ze zullen het uiteindelijk zelf wel merken en als ze dan iets willen weten zullen ze er wel om vragen
2278037 we hebben het recht niet om hen te informeren omtrent dragerschap als ze er niet zelf om vragen
2278038 oh wat is papa weer aan het knoeien h en dat gaat nog wel wat erger worden

2278052 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial rollercoaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election
2278053 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
2278054 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2278055 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2278056 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen
2278057 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2278058 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2278059 hes been very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview while he was on his trip i couldnt ask for him to be any more gracious than hes been and supportive since the campaign ended
2278060 in almost 20 years as a prosecutor and now as attorney general i cannot recall one case where someone has assaulted a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena

2278304 as i say below in horribly confused prose danahs presentation of her research on teen networking practices made me question whether teens are as impressed by the potential of global collaboration as we rightly are ive gone through two of them now and am fairly certain that once the unit was over so were any connections that those teens made with other teens flung wide around the globe during that unit

2278307 dit jaar was het thema nacht de inspiratiebron waar dichters die deelnamen aan de selexys scheltema almere po zieprijs 2008 mee aan de slag zijn gegaan een thema wat op diverse manieren po tisch belicht werd opvallend hierbij was vaak toch een wat sombere invalshoek in de categorie volwassenen zijn sic er dit jaar een record aantal inzendingen binnen gekomen hadden we vorig jaar een record van 189 gedichten van volwassenen dit jaar waren het er 221 de jongeren bleven dit jaar echter wat achter qua aantal inzendingen nl 51 gedichten hierbij moet wel opgemerkt worden dat de kwaliteit van de gedichten van de jongeren wel van een zodanig hoog niveau was dat het de jury verrast heeft ook dit jaar heeft de almere po zieprijs buiten de grenzen van de provincie flevoland zijn weg weer gevonden onze zuiderburen uit belgi waren weer goed vertegenwoordigd zowel in de categorie jongeren als volwassenen maar de verste inzending kwam dit jaar ut curacao 3e prijs categorie volwassenen ex aequo mulisch baby ich habe angst van max lerou ik ben vannacht jouw toevluchtsoord van bert deben voor de eerste keer in de geschiedenis van de almere po zieprijs zijn twee dichters op de derde plaats ge indigd qua puntentelling kwamen zij gelijk uit en ook de motivatie voor de keuze van het gedicht bracht geen duidelijke winnaar dus de eerlijkste manier is dan om de 3e prijs twee keer uit te reiken mulisch baby ich habe angst van max lerou is kort en krachtig de sfeer is hard en pakkend het is een rauw gedicht dat vragen oproept net zoals de titel wat gebeurt er wat is de context ik ben vannacht jouw toevluchtsoord van bert deben beschrijft in mooie zinnen de one night stand het gedicht toont in de eerste strofen een zekere geborgenheid om daarna met een mooie uitsmijter te komen in de laatste twee zinnen die het beeld doen kantelen en het gedicht ook een tikkeltje weemoedig maken

2278347 ive never heard you be so explicit about your political views
2278348 i like to think of myself as socially liberal and fiscally conservative
2278349 youre talking about something like what the french call terroir
2278350 it has to do with the way that the soil and climate in a given region contribute to the flavor of the food thats because the soils mineral content the amount of sun and rain it gets the local vegetation and so on all that is different in each region so lets say youre going to make cheese or wine using the same recipe in two different places the animals in one place will be grazing on different vegetation from those in the other and the grape vines will be growing in different soil and getting different amounts of sun and rain because the terroir is different the cheese will be different and the wine will be different even if you follow the same process for making them and thats true you can taste the difference its the same with some businesses every community has its own character which is sort of a spiritual terroir if youre really rooted in that community its going to have a big impact on the way you are

2278357 we have the frys com open coming up in a couple months and a couple other things on the forefront so im sure well somehow leverage that into youtube as well
2278358 we still want to keep it different which is why we have videos like how to make a margarita and a video featuring our beverage cart girl

2278386 de woonmaatschappij is begonnen met een onderzoek naar de volledige afsluiting van het senioren complex inhoudende het geheel afsluiten van de onderdoorgangen het voor niet bewoners ontoegankelijk maken van de portieken daarvoor moeten een hallofoon installatie en electrische deuropeners worden ge nstalleerd en moeten de brievenbussen worden verplaatst bij het onderzoek zullen de bewoners worden betrokken je mag verwachten dat er dan ook gekeken wordt naar de gevolgen voor rolstoelgebruikers als het onderzoek niet op onoverkomelijke bezwaren bv van bewoners stuit is het uiteindelijk een financi le kwestie de voorzieningen zullen niet leiden tot verhoging van de servicevergoeding van bewoners
2278387 dit is n van de grootste vraagstukken waarmee het nederland van nu kampt

2278408 zeg heb jij niets beters te doen ga boeven vangen of kom koffie brengen
2278409 maar dit ei heb ik opgegeten om je aandacht te trekken ik doe geen kwaad k niet maar ik vind het meer dan belangrijk om je te laten weten dat iemand je kwaad wil doen let dus op wat je doet mijn naam zet ik hier niet onder ik loop zo al gevaar genoeg
2278410 ik zou niks meer achterlaten h maar dit lijkt me toch wel heel erg belangrijk belangrijk genoeg om heel even een risico te nemen ga niet naar het politiebureau ze doen daar niks als er iets gebeurd is doen ze wat en geef ze eens ongelijk er gebeurt gewoon teveel je brengt jezelf en mij in groot gevaar zorg liever dat jullie groep sterk is en ga zelf op zoek het is maar een tip
2278411 sorry ik vond dat ik nog even in mijn rol moest blijven ik zat er net lekker in

2278426 ik zou maar niet naar school gaan als ik jullie was
2278427 tja simone heeft een oudtante die dit zeker nu moet horen
2278428 we hebben geen flauw idee wie de dader is dus nemen we maar het zekere voor het onzekere
2278429 voor het profiel open de bijlage ik heb geprobeerd zoveel mogelijk uit de informatie die jullie gaven te krijgen en ik heb daarbij misschien risicos genomen dingen die heel aannemelijk zijn maar niet altijd het geval zijn niet alles hoeft dus te kloppen veel heel veel sterkte en succes met het vinden van de dader en beterschap voor alle gewonden
2278430 een man blank onder de twintig jaar kan ook iets boven de twintig jaar zijn hij is snel bang en doet als of hij heel wat is maar stelt in werkelijkheid niks voor moord nee niet eens een poging dat is ook duidelijk te merken aan dat er na de moord van mariska een tijdje geen moord werd gepleegd maar een brand werd gesticht op klaarlichte dag in een huis waar de mensen z uit waren hij is doodsbang voor straf kijk maar naar alle perfect geregelde maatregeltjes zoals de vervormde stem en het onbekende telefoonnummer ik denk dat hij op zichzelf niet slecht is maar door omstandigheden gedwongen is z slecht te handelen en daar kunnen de meeste mensen zich toch wel tegen verzetten hij dus niet ik zie de dader niet als een bendetype hij is denk ik niet gewend aan groepen mensen hij vermoordt de mensen daarom ook individueel terwijl hij met een mes ook een hele groep kan neerhalen daarom denk ik niet dat de dader uit de stad komt hij is een dorpsmens
2278431 o ik ben echt kanker goed ik had natuurlijk als eerste die nieuwe aftershave nu ben ik echt zo geweldig

2278434 i can hardly name an area where choice is needed more
2278435 its no big secret that the client side of the it environment is one of the last bastions of proprietary technology disproportionately dominated by one vendor
2278436 we have long believed that helping to bring openness and choice to the client desktop is one of the next things to explode in this whole march for linux
2278437 the problem is for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
2278438 windows is not a huge cost when you get it on a new pc and the annual cost to get a supported version of linux with seven years of security fix support could end up costing you more than youre paying for windows windows has at least 10 years of security support and its free
2278439 and that does not even address access database apps or excel macros which may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
2278440 for a greenfield environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is apple mac
2278441 but for the typical environments windows apps are too pervasive and entrenched for a switch to make economic sense
2278442 were going to do something that the iau did not which is discuss what we know about planetary bodies in the solar system and around other stars and discuss the value of different ways of defining objects as planets and what that means
2278443 if a new consensus emerges it will easily overturn the iau this is not an issue
2278444 if not theyll stick with what theyve got until something better comes along
2278445 ive been arguing pluto for eight years so its another occasion where im arguing pluto this one happens to be a little more formal in its construct so i see it as another day of just trying to tell people teach people about what we now know about the solar system
2278446 when you bring a lot of creative talented people together new solutions can arise that might not have arisen from any one individual
2278447 the collaboration the intersection of ideas has its own way of creating new understanding
2278448 this topic provides the perfect opportunity to teach science as a process not a collection of facts
2278449 we also need to stress the importance of incorporating new discoveries to continually improve our understanding of the diverse objects within planetary systems
2278450 no votes will be taken at this conference to put specific objects in or out of the family of planets
2278451 but we will have advocates of the iau definition and proponents of alternative definitions presenting their cases
2278452 theres a lot of emotion still a lot of room for opinion
2278453 but its conferences like this that are hoping to settle the dust and see what remains standing and see if a consensus can emerge
2278454 everyone sings kumbaya at the end with a brand new classification scheme for everything that orbits a star that would be really cool

2278458 veel te vroeg of laat maar dat gaf niet want je hebt op het station van die oranje kastjes waar je prima in kunt zitten
2278459 we weten niet waar we aan toe zijn ons werd verteld dat de moskee twee jaar geleden af zou zijn het lijkt er nu nog niet op dat we volgend jaar in het nieuwe gebouw kunnen bidden
2278460 ons oude bestuur bestaat niet meer en over de financiering van de nieuwe moskee bestaat veel onduidelijkheid onze vragen worden door het bestuur niet beantwoord

2278579 what most people dont realise is that the codes are made up of a series of contractual relationships between the company and its staff the company and its suppliers etc
2278580 and these contractual relationships should be committed to writing to protect all the parties concerned

2278654 bob jones iii march 3 2000 interview on larry king live responding to questions regarding the basis for bjus interracial dating marriage ban
2278655 students never hear it preached there have been four five six generations of students that graduated from there have never heard this preached in our chapel or taught in our school

2278663 in spite of lengthy finding of fact in the district court that bob jones university was like a church and pervasively religious the supreme court saw fit to separate its religious purpose from its educational function
2278664 unquestionably our doctrine is not held universally but whose is
2278665 bob jones university does not discriminate on the basis of race it holds the doctrine that interracial marriage is contrary to principles set forth in gods word students who do not wish to subscribe to the universitys rules prohibiting interracial dating and marriage do not have to attend this institution
2278666 our right to be bible believing is the issue this is religious freedom in a nutshell
2278667 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men
2278668 do not wish to subscribe to the universitys rules prohibiting interracial dating and marriage do not have to attend this institution
2278669 there is no difference between the sacred and the secular
2278670 bob jones university stands without apology for the absolute authority of the bible
2278671 i dont care who votes i only care who counts the votes
2278672 we dont care what the bible teaches so long as we can interpret it the way most beneficial to ourselves and formulate bible policies that are in line with what we want
2278673 now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
2278674 its that same type of girlie princess stuff you always try to recommend to us

2278685 i am hoping to intrigue those who want wines that truly have a story to tell once people experience these wines and winemakers once they know that wine truly does have soul and character it will be difficult for them to cozy up to wines made by the numbers and not from the heart
2278686 the taste of biodynamic and organic and natural is one that appeals to a whole slew of people the taste of the other kind of wine one that i view more as a beverage than an art appeals to another group shouldnt both kinds of winemaking be taught
2278687 you cant be accepted to the yale drama school if you dont have some sort of inner artistic fire
2278688 every other winery i had visited had finished fermentation but here fermentation stopped when the wine wanted it to not when the winemaker stopped it

2278721 if a nonprofit organization has a membership structure the members have certain rights principally to elect or remove the directors to amend the bylaws and to approve organic changes initiated by the board such as dissolution or merger in dealing with an organizations members the board must act fairly it can curtail or abolish certain members rights or even decide to convert the nonprofit into a non membership organization but the membership must have adequate notice information and the right to vote upon such changes the corporation may not subvert corporate democracy to perpetuate itself in office
2278722 the subcommittee on the model nonprofit corporation law rejected the idea of requiring all mutual benefit corporations to have members who could elect directors and therefor have statutory rights consequently some mutual benefit corporations may have individuals who are called members but who do not have statutory membership rights under the revised act the rights of these individuals are left to development on a state by state basis

2278728 thanks be to god we have a pope who has decided to fight the devil head on
2278729 to emphasize what is called the communal mass to the disparagement of masses celebrated in private
2278730 to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism which all certainly admit in the eucharist expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of christs presence in this sacrament
2278731 to propose and act upon the opinion according to which in the consecrated hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the mass christ our lord is no longer present
2278732 these and similar opinions do great harm to the faith and devotion to the divine eucharist and therefore so that the hope aroused by the council that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole church be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions
2278733 people suffer and think that turning to the devil can help solve their problems we are being bombarded by requests for exorcisms

2278780 sec did not have effective internal control over financial reporting
2278781 this cant be right surely the organisation that is charged with ensuring reporting accuracy cant make mistakes or at least if they do make them presumably theyre not material theyre probably just itsy bitsy little errors
2278782 during this years audit we found control deficiencies in secs period end financial reporting process in its calculation of accounts receivable for disgorgements and penalties in its accounting for transaction fee revenue and in preparing its financial statement disclosures we believe these control deficiencies collectively constitute a material weakness
2278783 material theres a terminological inexactitude here these terms have always been confusing isnt material less significant than significant
2278784 but for the layperson who can only stand in wonder as the big beasts with deep pockets wrestle with the agonies of the sox taxonomy let me quote the gaos definition from page 4
2278785 a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected
2278786 i think we all recognize that effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to help ensure that companies provide investors with accurate financial statements our regulatory scheme which is based on full and accurate disclosure provides transparency which fosters the success of the financial markets if investors lose faith in the accuracy and completeness of companies financial statements and other disclosures they will be less willing to invest and our financial markets will suffer
2278787 we also identified three control deficiencies that adversely affect secs ability to meet its internal control objectives these conditions concern deficiencies in controls over 1 information security 2 property and equipment and 3 accounting for budgetary resources
2278788 who in their right mind would want to ipo a young high potential fast growing but unpredictable company on a market regulated by a body whose passion for enforcement is equalled only by their own failure to comply
2278789 in our review of secs year end draft financial statement disclosures we noted numerous errors including misstated amounts improper break out of line items and amounts from fiscal year end 2006 incorrectly brought forward as beginning balances for fiscal year 2007 for example in its disclosure for custodial revenues and liabilities sec improperly excluded approximately 320 million in collections in another example for its disclosure on fund balance with treasury sec misclassified approximately 90 million into incorrect line items
2278790 in addition the cumbersome and complicated nature of secs financial reporting process discussed above did not allow sec finance staff sufficient time to carry out thorough and complete reviews of the disclosures in light of the november 15 reporting deadline
2278791 who in their right mind would want to ipo a young high potential fast growing but unpredictable company on a market regulated by a body whose passion for enforcement is equalled only by their own failure to comply
2278792 in boston or silicon valley you dont need entities like jumpstart but here in the midwest you need a little goosing and cardioinsight is a good example of a company that would not have existed if a group of organizations had not proactively worked to pull the pieces together to form it

2278802 almost one in four men try to impress friends or dates by pretending to be wine buffs reveals a new survey however most risk being exposed as buffoons according to the poll which found knowledge of the drink is low despite soaring popularity the yougov poll of 2 396 adults revealed more than two thirds of people 69 per cent do not feel they know enough about wine although many attempting to disguise their ignorance by pretending to be experts

2278823 nu wil ik dat jullie deze pot zien als jullie eigen leven deze pot gevuld met golfballetjes kralen zand en koffie stelt namelijk het leven van een mens voor
2278824 de golfballetjes zijn de belangrijke dingen in het leven je familie je kinderen je geloof je gezondheid en je favoriete bezigheden dingen die ervoor zorgen dat als er niets meer op de wereld was dan deze dingen je leven toch gevuld zou zijn
2278825 de kralen zijn de andere dingen die belangrijk zijn je werk je huis je auto het zand dat staat voor de kleine dingetjes die belangrijk voor je zijn
2278826 als je het zand als eerste in de pot kiept en hem hiermee vult is er geen plek meer voor de kralen of voor de golfballetjes
2278827 zorg eerst voor de golfballetjes de dingen die echt het allerbelangrijkste voor je zijn stel je prioriteiten de rest is maar zand

2278832 it will become best practice to reconcile forfeiture experience quarterly based upon individual option grants and therefore any incremental changes in estimates will consistently be re amortized over the requisite service period during interim periods this approach will lend to less volatile financial statements comparatively against less frequent reconciliations

2278834 intellectual victory of john maynard keynes of john kenneth galbraith of hyman minsky
2278835 the completeness of his victory is something of a curiosity and a mystery it must have been due to a complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was projected that it reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect added i suppose to its intellectual prestige that its teaching translated into practice was austere and often unpalatable lent it virtue that it was adapted to carry a vast and consistent logical superstructure gave it beauty that it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress and the attempt to change such things as likely to do more harm than good commended it to authority that it afforded a measure of justification to the free activities of the individual capitalist attracted to it the support of the dominant social force behind authority
2278836 the use of quantity of money as a target has not been a success im not sure i would as of today push it as hard as i once did
2278837 the main monetarist message was vindicated monetary policy alone could reduce inflation permanently at a cost to output and employment that while substantial was far less than in common keynesian scenarios
2278838 second a determined independent central bank can acquire credibility for low inflation without an institutional mandate from the government
2278839 third a well timed aggressive interest rate tightening can reduce inflation expectations and preempt a resurgence of inflation without creating a recession
2278840 this line of argument implies that inflation targeting yields the best cyclical behavior of employment and output that monetary policy alone can deliver thus and here is the revolutionary point delivered by the modern theoretical consensus even those who care mainly about the stabilization of the real economy can support a low inflation objective for monetary policy m onetary policy should therefore not try to counteract fluctuations in employment and output due to real business cycles
2278841 the recent rise in inflation is of concern to the fomc the federal reserve must guard against the emergence of an inflationary psychology that could impart greater persistence to what would otherwise be a transitory increase in inflation
2278842 the fomc again indicated that its predominant policy concern is the risk that inflation will fail to ease as expected
2278843 with the level of resource utilization relatively high and with a sustained moderation in inflation pressures yet to be convincingly demonstrated the fomc has consistently stated that upside risks to inflation are its predominant policy concern
2278844 technological advances have dramatically transformed the provision of financial services in our economy notably increasingly sophisticated information technologies enable lenders to collect and process data necessary to evaluate and price risk much more efficiently than in the past
2278845 market competition among financial providers for the business of informed consumers is in my judgment the best mechanism for promoting the provision of better lowercost financial products
2278846 one study that analyzed nearly 40 000 affordable mortgage loans targeted to lower income borrowers found that counseling before the purchase of a home reduced ninety day delinquency rates by 19 percent on average
2278847 despite the ongoing adjustments in the housing sector overall economic prospects remain good
2278848 overall the u s economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace this year and next with growth strengthening somewhat as the drag from housing diminishes
2278849 delinquency rates on variable interest loans to subprime borrowers which account for a bit less than 10 percent of all mortgages outstanding have climbed sharply in recent months
2278850 at this juncture however the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained
2278851 in recent weeks we have also seen increased concerns about credit risks on some other types of financial instruments
2278852 in a community which is so organized that a veil of money is as i have said interposed over a wide field between the actual asset and the wealth owner the ostensible proprietor of the actual asset has financed it by borrowing money from the actual owner of wealth furthermore it is largely through the banking system that all this has been arranged that is to say the banks have for a consideration interposed their guarantee they stand between the real borrower and the real lender it is for this reason that a decline in money values so severe as that which we are now experiencing threatens the solidarity of the whole financial structure banks and bankers are by nature blind they have not seen what was coming some of them have even welcomed the fall of prices towards what in their innocence they have deemed the just and natural and inevitable level that is to say to the level of prices to which their minds became accustomed in their formative years in the united states some of them employ so called economists who tell us even today that our troubles are due to the fact that the prices of some commodities and some services have not yet fallen enough a sound banker alas is not one who foresees danger and avoids it but one who when he is ruined is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way along with his fellows so that no one can really blame him
2278853 t here were no reasons for expecting disaster no one could foresee that production prices incomes and all other indicators would continue to shrink for three long and dismal years only after the market crash were there plausible grounds to suppose that things might now for a long while get a lot worse
2278854 there seems little question that in 1929 modifying a famous clich the economy was fundamentally unsound many things were wrong including the bad distribution of income the bad corporate structure the bad banking structure the dubious state of the foreign balance and the poor state of economic intelligence
2278855 to regard the people of any time as particularly obtuse seems vaguely improper and it also establishes a precedent which members of this generation might regret yet it seems certain that the economists and those who offered economic counsel in the late twenties and early thirties were almost uniquely perverse
2278856 as everyone here knows in their monetary history friedman and schwartz made the case that the economic collapse of 1929 33 was the product of the nations monetary mechanism gone wrong
2278857 let me end my talk by slightly abusing my status as an official representative of the federal reserve i would like to say to milton and anna regarding the great depression youre right we did it were very sorry but thanks to you we wont do it again
2278858 in conjunction with the failure to regulate sub prime loans with the permissive attitude to securitization with the repeal of glass steagall and with the general calamity of turning the work of government over to bankers
2278859 economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man
2278860 all things are subject to the law of cause and effect this great principle knows no exception and we would search in vain in the realm of experience for an example to the contrary
2278861 in my opinion the private credit markets have forfeited their privileged right to operate relatively autonomously because of incompetence excessive greed and in minor instances fraudulent activities
2278862 as a result the deflating private markets balance sheet is being re nationalized in some cases with increased regulation in others with outright guarantees and agency lending
2278863 ultimately government programs which support private credit market assets may be required in order to prevent an asset deflation of significant proportions
2278864 since homes are the most highly levered and monetarily significant asset that american consumers own if they decline much further they will drag the rest of the economy with them
2278865 home price declines of 20 percent are in fact much more of a shock to the american economy than the popping of the internet bubble and the nasdaq 5000 because the amount of homeowner leverage is so much greater
2278866 the home price decline needs to be stopped quickly to avert additional crises
2278867 the private credit markets have forfeited their privileged right to operate relatively autonomously because of incompetence excessive greed and in minor instances fraudulent activities
2278868 i f one is not a keynesian or even a true believer in that fiction called aggregate demand then there are plenty of very good reasons to believe that it is necessary to permit housing prices to fall to their true market values
2278869 to take my disagreement with this financial guru bill gross one step farther i will say that if the government follows his advice and tries to prop up housing prices to unsustainable levels the fallout will be far worse than what he can imagine
2278870 the reasoning here brings us back to menger and the law of cause and effect
2278871 i t will be for monetarism the principle that inflation could be defeated only by targeting the growth of the money supply and thereby changing expectations that friedman will be best remembered
2278872 why then has this his most important idea ceased to be honoured even in the breach
2278873 at the federal reserve too friedmans rules once zealously applied by paul volcker gradually gave way to alan greenspans discretion
2278874 anti monetarists point out that the relationship between monetary growth and inflation has simply broken down
2278875 yet simply because consumer price inflation has remained low money has not become irrelevant on the contrary it is the key to understanding the world economy today for there is nothing in friedmans work that states that monetary expansion is always and everywhere a consumer price phenomenon
2278876 in our time unlike in the 1970s oil price pressures have been countered by the entry of low cost asian labour into the global workforce
2278877 as a result monetary expansion in our time does not translate into significantly higher prices in shopping malls
2278878 it makes sense consumer goods are plentiful the supply of computing power has grown even faster than the supply of credit to consumers but shares in chinese banks and houses with chelsea postcodes are scarce while the supply of credit to their potential purchasers seems almost infinite
2278879 no one can say for sure what the consequences will be of this new variety of inflation for the winners one asset bubble leads merrily to another the key is to know when to switch from real estate to paintings by gustav klimt for the losers there is the compensation of cheap electronics
2278880 in this connection i realize that many favor placing strong pressure on china to sharply revalue its currency
2278881 in short if the international dollar reserve system must eventually be changed we should not try to do it with ad hoc measures rather we should begin to design a new system capable if possible of greater enduring stability than the present one
2278882 a system that requires a large vibrant middle class to succeed
2278883 people dont learn from the mistakes of others they seldom learn from their own mistakes never underestimate the power of human stupidity
2278884 i think inflation is generational and that we should not take anyone seriously who postmodernizes it for short term gain especially those who refuse to consider why any construct for measuring inflation shouldnt correlate to a population sampling
2278885 four nobel prize winning economists on tuesday and in a panel discussion on innovation in financial services on wednesday attempted at several points to take issue with some of the ideas that might have been oversimplified and met considerable resistance as did edmund phelps and i noted what care scholes took to be precise and non controversial in his presentation
2278886 valletta accommodates by having entire streets made of steps long and wide landings almost that might take two strides each

2278923 proxy voting the members have the right unless otherwise provided in this subsection or in the governing documents to vote in person or by proxy to be valid a proxy must be dated must state the date time and place of the meeting for which it was given and must be signed by the authorized person who executed the proxy a proxy is effective only for the specific meeting for which it was originally given as the meeting may lawfully be adjourned and reconvened from time to time and automatically expires 90 days after the date of the meeting for which it was originally given a proxy is revocable at any time at the pleasure of the person who executes it if the proxy form expressly so provides any proxy holder may appoint in writing a substitute to act in his or her place
2278924 the thing to realise about the early 1990s was that you had a falling interest rate environment for several years following the recession of late 89 90
2278925 everyone was looking for yield it was a period when bankers could do almost anything you could dream of and people would buy it for example we had structures with names such as libor squared inverse floater power options convexity forwards etc that drove a lot of innovation
2278926 i was very outspoken then in saying that there is nothing wrong with the product its just that the excesses got out of control but it was a very humbling period it brought down a number of traders and senior people there was a lot of soul searching
2278927 we set out to design a business guided by market discipline because we believed that it should be an even better guide to good behaviour than regulatory proscription
2278928 in this case jpmorgan had a good reason to look at how it handled credit
2278929 one of the crucial points happened in late 1997 around then credit derivatives structurers started to meet with securitisation structurers
2278930 the bingo moment was in the coffee queue of our chicago office when the two groups met by chance and realised they needed to talk to each other
2278931 we couldnt see how other banks made that business work
2278932 it is all about the herd instinct people do stupid things in search of yield when interest rates are so low without proper risk reward considerations
2278933 this crisis has nothing to do with innovation it is about excesses in banking
2278934 every four to five years there is a new excess in banking you had the asian crisis then the internet bubble the problem this time is extraordinary excess in the housing market
2278935 a lot of the problems in structured finance have not been due to too much innovation but a failure to innovate sufficiently people have just taken the original bistro idea say added zeros and done it over and over again without really thinking about the limits of diversification as a risk management tool there is a big difference between using this structure for corporate loans as we did at jpmorgan and subprime mortgages
2278936 this credit crunch gives good evidence that market discipline has guided the derivatives business better than regulation has steered housing finance
2278937 i think in the next year or two finance may become simpler
2278938 but after that we will probably just go back to the old ways again
2278939 the speed at which the market has found opportunities after this crisis is impressive

2278996 we assume that intimacy hinges on acceptance and validation from our partner weve confused good communication with being understood the way we want and getting the response we expect we never consider the kind of intimacy where we validate our own disclosures when out partner doesnt weve distorted what intimacy is how it feels how much we really want it and how best to get it once we realize that intimacy is not always soothing and often makes us feel insecure it is clear why we back away from it

2279016 as chinese south africans we were officially classified as coloured during the apartheid era and suffered under the same discriminatory laws prior to 1994
2279017 the logical inference was thus that chinese south africans would automatically qualify for the same benefits afforded to the
2279018 however this was not the case and the chinese south africans have suffered a second round of unfair discrimination by not being sure of their status under the two acts
2279019 for example one commercial bank would given the historical considerations classify chinese south africans as black for the purposes of the employment equity act and the broad based black economic empowerment act whereas another commercial bank declined to do so
2279020 the net result was that chinese south africans were never sure of their status
2279021 how blessed is the man who like hafez has tasted in his heart the wine made before adam
2279022 so you can see this is an important issue especially for the ladies
2279023 when these two life forces for individuality and togetherness are expressed in balanced healthy ways the result is a meaningful relationship that doesnt deteriorate into emotional fusion giving up your individuality to be together is as defeating in the long run as giving up your relationship to maintain your individuality either way you end up being less of a person with less of a relationship
2279024 differentiation is your ability to maintain your sense of self when you are emotionally and or physically close to others especially as they become increasingly important to you
2279025 when we have little differentiation our identity is constructed out of whats called a reflected sense of self we need continual contact validation and consensus or disagreement from others we develop a contingent identity based on a self in relationship because our identity depends on the relationship we may demand that our partner doesnt change so that our identity wont either
2279026 people whose identity is primarily dependent upon their relationship dont facilitate the development of those they love they lose their identity when others change
2279027 differentiation occurs by maintaining yourself in the presence of important persons not by getting away from them
2279028 what im describing is mutuality differentiation is the key to mutuality as a perspective a mind set it offers a solution to the central struggle of any long term relationship going forward with your own self development while being concerned with your partners happiness and well being
2279029 differentiation is not about always putting yourself ahead of everyone else
2279030 what i want for myself versus what you want for you shifts to what i want for myself versus wanting for you what you want for yourself if you talk your partner our of what he or she wants so you can have your way you lose when you participate in the agendas of those you love and sacrifice out of your own differentiation it enhances your sense of self rather than leaving you feeling like you have sold yourself out

2279142 how can you determine the fair value of your employee stock options if a the method you use to calculate the value of the options is based on the portion of the enterprise value allocated to the common stock and b the portion allocated to the common stock is a function of the value allocated to the options

2279144 to correctly account for these interrelationships all new and existing esos and the common stock must be valued simultaneously since most option valuation models require stock value as an input as opposed to an output these models should be modified to let both stock value and eso value be determined simultaneously with fair value of equity being provided as an input

2279406 this is a major step forward the law lords ruling handed the insurance industry a 1 4bn windfall they were the only winners they took the premiums and should pay the claims
2279407 until last year a person who developed pleural plaques had the right to claim damages against a negligent employer
2279408 my meetings with ministers at the policy forum were extremely constructive and it seems that there is a broad cross party spectrum of support for the review
2279409 pleural plaques are symptomless do not lead to an increase in other conditions and have no effect on health at all
2279410 making pleural plaques compensatable could create certain precedents of people being compensated for exposure to asbestos alone and could result in further anxiety for people
2279411 we as an industry are committed to paying compensation for mesothelioma and other asbestos related conditions as quickly as possible but are opposed to any change in this law
2279412 een van de rechten van de gehandicapten is het recht om geboren te worden
2279413 terwijl niemand gediscrimineerd mag worden en de huidige regering het vaak over gelijkheid heeft discrimineert deze wet
2279414 veel vrouwen kiezen niet vrijwillig voor abortus maar bevinden zich in een situatie waarin zij niet weten hoe het verder moet
2279415 soms door familie of artsen in de richting van abortus geduwd
2279416 een deel van het probleem is dat handicaps nog steeds als negatief worden gezien
2279417 mensen begrijpen handicaps niet en evenmin waartoe mensen in staat zijn als de samenleving hen een kans zou geven
2279418 het is verbijsterend dat in dit informatietijdperk daar nog weinig informatie over is
2279419 als je binnen bent en je kunt nergens aan meedoen heb je niets aan toegankelijkheid
2279420 met kunst en vliegwerk proberen mensen daar iets aan te doen maar dat is vaak niet goed overdacht een gehandicapte wil op eigen kracht naar binnen kunnen niet met hulp van anderen een te steile hellingbaan is hoe goed bedoeld ook geen oplossing bovendien behoeven ook andere groepen dan rolstoelgebruikers aanpassingen blinden slechthorenden elke gehandicapte heeft zijn eigen wensen
2279421 de christelijke visie op de gemeente is dat iedereen meedoet als een gehandicapte letterlijk en figuurlijk geen toegang heeft is hij een outcast zoals die er ook waren in de tijd van de bijbel
2279422 zij zijn in staat mee te doen en te denken maar niemand vraagt hen
2279423 dat zal wel te moeilijk voor hen zijn hetzelfde geldt voor vrijwilligerswerk gehandicapten zijn het voorwerp van zorg terwijl ze zelf ook vrijwilliger kunnen zijn we moeten echter niet altijd focussen op wat niet kan wie heeft er bovendien geen beperking sommigen zijn bang in het donker dat maakt een mens tot mens
2279424 whats so important about that is this really the first time a black man has been nominated
2279425 our family scrapbooks celebrate the good times helps us remember how we get through the hard times and are a legacy we will leave for generations to come

2279428 with moses came the beginning of the arian age when sheperds become common religious figures and the opposite sign libra contributes the symbolism of the judgment and scales of justice
2279429 be strong and courageous because you will lead these people to inherit the land i swore to their forefathers to give them 7 be strong and very courageous be careful to obey all the law my servant moses gave you do not turn from it to the right or to the left that you may be successful wherever you go 8 do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful 9 have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go
2279430 do not abandon your servants come up to us quickly and save us help us because all the amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us
2279431 do not be afraid of them i have given them into your hand not one of them will be able to withstand you
2279432 o sun stand still over gibeon o moon over the valley of aijalon
2279433 as the navel is set in the centre of the human body so is the land of israel the navel of the world situated in the centre of the world and jerusalem in the centre of the land of israel and the sanctuary in the centre of jerusalem and the holy place in the centre of the sanctuary and the ark in the centre of the holy place and the foundation stone before the holy place because from it the world was founded
2279434 now is the time to put 100 kilograms of explosives into the mosque of omar so that we may rid ourselves of it once and for all
2279435 if during the course of the war a bomb had fallen on the mosque and it would have you know disappeared that would have been a good thing
2279436 the only way for me to escape this terrible place was to grab at the flaming mane of pegasus as he flashed past me
2279437 it makes me ask what is going on i can only conclude that people are not aware of their risks and what could be done about them
2279438 it wasnt sharp it was more of a kind of pressure a feeling like something is contracting
2279439 when you think about it its not the diabetes that kills you its the diabetes causing cardiovascular disease that kills you
2279440 if you are one of those 82 percent who dont think you are at increased risk
2279441 finding out that you are and that you can decrease that risk substantially could literally change your life
2279442 many practicing doctors just dont know that an ldl cholesterol number that is normal for someone without diabetes is not normal for someone with diabetes
2279443 everybody in the act of losing weight will have a pretty dramatic improvement pretty quickly
2279444 there is a range of susceptibilities in how people react
2279445 right now without waiting for lots of exciting things that are almost in the pipeline or in the pipeline starting tomorrow if everyone did these things taking a statin taking a blood pressure medication and maybe taking an aspirin you would reduce the heart attack rate by half
2279446 many come here once or twice and walk away saying i dont want to do this
2279447 pricking your finger seeing that number day after day it wears on you
2279448 that is why it is not uncommon to start initially with diet therapy then after a few years we need to add a drug that improves insulin sensitivity
2279449 then when that drug isnt enough we add a second drug that improves insulin sensitivity by a different mechanism then we add a drug that stimulates that pancreas to make more insulin

2279456 there was not just a minor difference in quality but a huge difference in quality

2279459 part of sustainability is local economy if you are importing extraordinary amounts of fuel labor and machinery and shipping your product far and wide you are part of the problem
2279460 id like to see more small acreages return to animal power
2279461 the horses are self sustaining they can make babies try getting your john deere tractor to do that they help produce their own food hay the provide nutrients back to the fields manure they are quieter than the tractor and better for the farmers soul and overall they may be cheaper than a tractor in fuel hay vs petrol and repair vet vs mechanic bills
2279462 we use small amounts of sulfites in the winemaking process to ensure that the wines we produce are suitable for aging sulfite free wines are extremely unstable and likely to oxidize or volatilize within a couple of years
2279463 if there is a marketing campaign planned it should be aimed at revising the laws so that they are in synch with europe where wines that are organically farmed and which are under a certain maximum number of parts per million of sulfur can call themselves organic
2279464 its america so you have to vote with your dollars
2279465 if you support sustainability small farms reducing carbon output etc then you need to buy those products you cant say youre for all this and then run to costco trader joes or safeway and buy the cheapest products that are produced on a mass scale thousands of miles away however we do live in a modern world and its not really possible to be a zealot about this one of my favorite sayings and advice we try to live by regarding sustainability is from aldo leopold we shall never achieve harmony with land any more than we shall achieve absolute justice or liberty for people in these higher aspirations the important thing is not to achieve but to strive

2279599 we believe the word team is overused in corporate america a team is more than a group of people working together to be a real team there must be a team spirit with each person genuinely caring about his or her teammates success teams that win have chemistry and synergy with members focusing on doing their own job well and assisting others whenever they can a successful team is consistently fighting and winning battles over selfishness a difficult and noble feat to achieve lets face it we all have our personal agendas to surrender our individual ego to the good of the team takes work sacrifice trust and courage

2279700 toe maar oma opa wacht op u pak zijn hand over die regenboog ga er voorbij wij letten op papa
2279701 that sounds heard rumors to the effect that he rudder had an os project in place
2279702 mere mortal developers need a programming model application model that lets them distribute processing to massively parallel devices without having to become experts
2279703 even with the quad core intel chips today you have to have specialist teams to take full advantage of them
2279704 im going to assume that eliminating dynamic loading doesnt prevent dynamic language execution
2279705 be clear that restricting dynamism at the os level will not impact dynamism at the programming level
2279706 why shouldnt the average developer begin to think in terms of lightweight asynchronous services
2279707 after all thats the migration path were seeing on the web
2279708 this allows existing development tools to be easily repurposed while a lot of the complexity is hidden from the developer that is using it we essentially see declarative programming replacing imperative programming at the os level
2279709 i wonder if microsoft concluded this sort of 10 year sea change was needed before kicking oslo into high gear
2279710 a lot of these problems are being solved at least partially by the ideas of store and forward and message synchronization
2279711 google gears adobe air even the mobile oses with things like sms can handle occasional connectivity why shouldnt this be built into core os communication protocols especially if they are asynchronous by default
2279712 a very smart compiler or runtime could move a calculation onto a gpu or distribute it across cores
2279713 in a world where moores law doesnt imply the speeding of individual components where does this expectation come from and who holds it
2279714 reflects the reality of programming today the vast majority of professional developers especially those in it and out on the web dont deal with low level constructs unless youre a game developer isv or systems programmer there really isnt the need to do pointer math
2279715 on the one hand the phrase strong notions of immutability has serious implications if meant formally but elsewhere we see thread safety remains elusive and a laundry list of things that might contribute to a solution
2279716 in this scenario you establish midori not so much as a replacement for windows
2279717 but as the hub of a new type of distributed system which windows machines connect into until they are no longer needed
2279718 this is the second attempt at re implementing os scheduling that ive seen announced in as many months
2279719 steve jobs talked at the apple worldwide developers conference on june 9 about how snow leopard was going to have a new scheduling framework that would make take advantage of multicore easier for os x developers this seems to reach similar conclusions and then take it to the next step in terms of scheduling flexibility
2279720 our significant breakthroughs in search technology have enabled us to index much more of the internet placing nearly the entire web at the fingertips of every user
2279721 competing with google is still a very daunting task as microsoft will tell you
2279722 they do have the talent that is used to building large industrial strength search engines

2279732 the need for the alliance is predicated on the significant increase and complexity of security related risks to international commerce from terrorism cyber attacks internet viruses theft fraud extortion and other threats that require corporations to develop a more comprehensive approach to protect the enterprise that approach often features convergence a holistic view of security that takes an integrated approach to information and traditional security it ensures that all functions within the enterprise work together to identify and mitigate risks and to effectively manage security related incidents to reduce a potential negative impact on people profitability and property
2279733 the component of an enterprise risk management model focused on the security perspective for identification assessment and mitigation of those events that impact an organizations ability to achieve its business goals and objectives esrm concentrates on organizational activities relating to the planning prevention response resiliency recovery and resumption of events creating physical technical and administrative mitigation controls that provide for the deterrence detection assessment and response to such events esrm is a holistic risk management process that aligns organizational drivers affecting strategy processes people technology and knowledge to protect key assets in accordance with governance risk and compliance grc requirements esrm requires cross functional collaboration within the back drop of erm between multiple management disciplines including but not limited to physical and logical security safety legal risk management crisis management and business continuity planning
2279734 component of an erm facilitating cross functional collaboration between multiple management disciplines
2279735 the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country
2279736 even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection like germany and canada are sinking into the mire
2279737 the last five years has seen a litany of surveillance initiatives
2279738 we would expect the cancellation of some programs the review of others but this hasnt occurred
2279739 of a profitable surveillance industry dominated by global it companies and the creation of numerous international treaties that frequently operate outside judicial or democratic processes
2279740 our view is that privacy friendly systems will emerge in coming years and that consumers will soon begin to see privacy as a political issue

2279745 im also going to talk about democracy because the forces of moderation ultimately have to transition into moderate democratic forces or the middle east i think is not going to be stable
2279746 maybe we should all wear bags over our heads call this gitmo chic
2279747 before we rant and rave about immigrants look at the lives many of them have been compelled to leave
2279748 some have been bombed from their homes or left countries so poor you couldnt imagine how dire they could be to live there
2279749 our service economy would grind to a halt without them and how many people who complain about this have lived on a lifetime of handouts
2279750 its basic humanity to help those in dire need having to live with your parents is no hardship compared to having to completely give up your country and friends and move somewhere with nothing but a few possessions
2279751 we need more social housing not less dirt poor immigrants
2279752 i ask you why again why the uk is nothing but a dumping place for all and sundry and how are we repaid by getting ourselves blew to pieces get real what is wrong with us why the hell arent we on the streets 24 7 protesting i am and always have been a law abiding person but by god its getting harder by the hour i am not surprised some citizens are retaliating theres no alternative well rik stanovsokz do you have a job do you have a tv license do you have tax and insurance on you car i hope you do i know a polish family who rent a flat yes they had lovely stuff but the guy did not know what a tax disc was or a tv license was so he got done for both you may get handouts and think it is great but if you dont live by the law you will get caught out by the very people who you thought you could take the p out of guess i work in the caring profession and by no means am i discriminatory against anyone equal opportunities are the very essence of any society after 20 years in the caring sector i have come to the conclusion that britain is falling apart and things have got out of hand yes we should all care about each other but would we be able to go to any country in the world and walk straight into housing with financial benefits and get assistance to set it all up i think not the crime rate has become almost intolerable there is considerable strain on our nhs and i feel that our own people are not being given any preference at all i was recently divorced and as a consequence i lost my home my job and nearly my sanity i became homeless and had to live with a relative i was told that because i wasnt a vulnerable adult that i had to sort myself out we are all vulnerable at certain times in our life i needed help and support desperatley and was rejected were do the priorities of this goverment lie i can of course take my skills and knowledge to another country this is why we are loosing our trained professionals what is going to become of all of this and when will it end i feel that there will come a time when the young people of this country will start a revolution as they will be resentful because we have a very unfair system and it does get me cross to think of all the years of hard work and taxes i paid are being squandered to keznjj guess what i dont pay taxes so you cant have mine i work less than 16 hours a week maybe ill send your poem to the goverment in fact why dosnt every person on here who agres send a copy to the goverment as well and tell them you are taking the pee i enter conutry with nothing now i have leather seats big comfy bed 42 inch tv internet free telephone calls free money each week to feed my 4 children free clothes next week we are moving out of small 2 bedroom house to a 4 bedroom with big garden and at christmas we get big cash bonus this country great what is it with this country when we have flood disasters or anything serious in this country all our brits get forgotten about if the commonwealth countries wanted there indepence from britain fine tear up there passports and let them get on with it dont let them come running back when theres trouble now most countries are safer for them send them back give our kids a chance what about the flood victims of our country help them first so fed up with our country being used what about the rest of europe doing there bit stop the immigration now this country is too easy and we all feel like second citizens in our own country if they want to live here make them have enough money to sustain there stay and dont give them benefits so queue jumping on housing this is just another prime example of this ridiculous country i moved back from canada in 2000 and i wish i had stayed over there this country has got a lot worse its cramped dirty people are rude there are no public houses left i hate this country if you go abroad and then come back you wil see exactly what i mean shame on the goverment for letting every tom dick and harry in i can tell you that when i left in 1996 it was no where near as bad as this either that or the press wasnt reporting it we were once proud to look up to this country as it was also to those people that have said britain has created this there selfs shame on you as you dont deserve to be british go live somewere else see if they will treat you well 85 per cent on this thread is fed up and they deserve to be because its a shambles as they say dont just write fight for your rights give gorden some stick i am sick and tired of working 24 7 just to pay for all those illegal immigrants out there i dont get why we should work all our lives for the money we earn to go towards furnishing flats and homes for illegal immigrants to live in luxury when were left with nothing its about time that our good for nothing so called government get off their lazy ass and do something about it that they actually do something good for our country we should be paying attention to the people who need help homes jobs medical attention etc in our own country before we start trying to play the hero by helping illegal immigrants and another thing why the hell are they here in our country in the first place if theyre illegal immigrants they dont deserve the help theyre getting from our government when all they do is expect the very best from us we build them homes mosques for their religion when we all know for a fact that they wouldnt do jack shit if we were to go to their country if they want to live here in england then they should pay for themselves like the rest of us have to they should find their own jobs make their own money and stop living off our money its no good just complaining about this its time we actually do something even if you just sign a petition youre still helping this is a total disgrace doing this for immigrants when we have are own people who cant even get a council house when these so called people arrive in our country they should be made to work straightaway or if they dont want to work throw them out straightaway they should take the government with them everyday on news you hear storys our own people who have life threatening conditions cant get medication on nhs then you read articles like this us english all need to stick together and get these people out of our country right away before they take over us which they have already u k ha ha ha me and my wife try our best to show our 2 kids it is best to work for what you want need then this like i said u k ha ha ha as someone else said here dont blame the asylum seekers or illegal imigrants blame the parties responsible ie the torie party and the labour party lets not forget the councils either the way that the both parties have sold this country down the river just goes to show they only care about how much there getting now they sell our soverignty so other countries can tell us what to do as far as laws and immmigration go im no racist i have many friends who are hard working people from all over ask there views and they too think its disgusting i know two brothers who are from pakistan and where brought over here when they were young they run a confectionist and work loads of hours but are really great people they tell me how disgusted they are and how the area now has gone from bad to worse i am 59 and will retire next year after 30 years in the health service i am saddend to see how it is run now and i could tell you stories that would make your hair curl i read the other day that there are about 40 000 british people leaving this counrty every year because there fed up with the high taxation and the way they are treated in there own country of birth and people are not treated equal i never fogot what someone said to me once quote

2279770 de dokter laat bewust een stilte vallen om de spanning verder op te voeren
2279771 na een intensieve chemokuur in de afgelopen maanden zonder aanmerkelijk resultaat is besloten tot deze drastische stap geen makkelijke keuze maar de patient staat bij ons bekend als optimistisch positief en vol met levensmoed de ingreep staat bekend als risicovol en we hebben na uitvoerig overleg besloten om deze vanmorgen om 09 13 te laten plaatsvinden
2279772 nadat de patient onder narcose is gebracht is het gezwel ter grootte van een cherry tomaat chirurgisch verwijderd ik kan u met trots mededelen dat de operatie is geslaagd

2279870 is intended to right size the evaluation and assessment efforts of managements and its intended to do that for companies of all sizes
2279871 regulators hope the management guidance and a companion measure that is expected to be approved by the public company accounting oversight board today will reduce costs enough that they will at last feel comfortable requiring smaller public companies to comply with the internal controls provision of the 2002 law
2279872 we do believe that its not only doable for smaller companies but doable in 2007
2279873 strong concern that the securities and exchange commission sec failed to provide an extension for small public companies to comply with sarbanes oxley internal control regulations
2279874 according to a recent government accountability office study small public companies spend a disproportionately greater amount of time and money to comply with sarbanes oxley regulations than large public companies firms worth 1 billion or more spend just 13 cents per 100 in revenue for audit fees while small businesses are forced to spend more than 1 to comply with the same rules
2279875 national venture capital association warns congress that sec and pcaob sox reform proposals do not go far enough venture industry cites lack of effort by auditors to reduce costs
2279876 first we are gravely concerned that the accounting profession will not change its high cost practices and the recent guidance provided by both the sec and the pcaob regarding materiality is not specific enough to compel them to do so
2279877 second the oligopoly that exists for 404 audits leaves no choice for small companies in terms of service providers it does not provide any incentive for the big 4 accounting firms to lower costs lastly because of these first two concerns it is imperative that prior to adoption all proposed measures are fully field tested to confirm that they will indeed reduce costs
2279878 despite persistent criticism from top lawmakers and advocacy groups securities and exchange commission chairman christopher cox is standing by his agencys decision to make small businesses begin complying this summer with the most controversial provision of the 2002 sarbanes oxley law

2279968 many explanations have been offered to make sense of the here today gone tomorrow nature of medical wisdom what we are advised with confidence one year is reversed the next but the simplest one is that it is the natural rhythm of science an observation leads to a hypothesis the hypothesis last years advice is tested and it fails this years test which is always the most likely outcome in any scientific endeavor there are after all an infinite number of wrong hypotheses for every right one and so the odds are always against any particular hypothesis being true no matter how obvious or vitally important it might seem

2279973 talentontwikkeling is voor mij tweeledig aan de ene kant is het een wereld te laten zien van oneindig veel mogelijkheden alles is mogelijk aan de andere kant is het de passie s van het kind centraal stellen en het volgen van zijn passie en interesses en eerlijk waar ik heb geen idee welk talent dat ook is zij hebben het in zich en ik kan ze alleen maar faciliteren in hun groei te worden wie ze zijn talent komt voort uit passie ik speel in op hun passie s en faciliteer ze daarin als mijn kinderen bijvoorbeeld met treinen spelen zal ik ze daarin proberen te faciliteren meer ruimte op de grond meer spoor meer treinen etc een kind heeft van zelf een gevoel dat het na een treinenperiode genoeg is en ontwikkelt nieuwe interesses dat hoef ik hem niet te vertellen hoewel dat bij het ene kind veel automatischer gaat dan de ander ook laat ik hen veel dingen zien die nieuw voor hen zijn maar waarvan ik verwacht dat ze daar door geinspireerd kunnen raken die moet je ontwikkelen en niet begraven voor mijn gevoel gebeurt het op scholen vaak dat persoonlijke talenten van kinderen worden begraven waarom weten leraren en het instituut school beter wat goed voor een kind is dan het kind zelf of hoeft een school geen omgeving te zijn waar ze hun passie volgen die vraag intrigeert mij al jarenlang en daarom krijgen mijn kinderen ook thuisonderwijs hoewel ze soms wel even op school zijn en ik geniet er dan van wanneer ze tijdens het voorlezen stiekum een puzzel pakken die ze tijdens het ja ik luister wel voorlezen maken hij volgt gelukkig ook dan zijn eigen gevoel
