6590050 we have agreed that some goals some asp advertisement irational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6590051 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighbouring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighbouring countries and we already did clarify this
6590052 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6590053 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6590054 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6590055 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6590056 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6590057 we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6590059 there is no evidence that fundamental conditions are improving for customers or retail businesses consumer confidence remains low unemployment is rising and the housing market weakening
6590060 its hard to see what could produce the sales growth boost ons are reporting or their finding that smaller retailers are outperforming larger ones
6590061 should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6590062 todays data adds little to the monetary policy debate the mpc has discussed the official data in great detail and it has found it inconsistent with the surveys and the fundamentals much like the mpc we recommend that the data be treated with extreme caution
6590063 in our view the committee is unlikely to cut policy rates if inflation outturns continue to surprise on the upside especially if the strength is driven from core components
6590064 in the minutes to the august mpc meeting the committee had noted official numbers somewhat at variance with the weak survey results for the second quarter of the year to june and we suspect that the mpc will maintain the assessment for july
6590065 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6590066 all security service staff have an awareness of the human rights act 1998 and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the uk and overseas
6590067 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
6590068 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities
6590069 the relationship of the united kingdom government to the united states authorities in connection with mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6590070 as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment
6590071 however unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the americans it waivers in this commitment
6590072 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily

6590075 this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualised for women based on the years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen
6590076 further research with appropriate measures is needed to assess more fully the impact of combined hrt on all aspects of health related quality of life for postmenopausal women
6590077 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6590078 the days of assuming that older people are dependants must come to an end
6590079 the government must face up to the reality of an ageing population and make a firm commitment to improve health services like mental health and foot care which enable people to stay healthy and independent for longer
6590080 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6590081 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6590082 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6590083 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6590084 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year
6590085 it shows we do have support for what we are doing it gives us a sense of pride
6590086 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too
6590087 gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury many cannot afford the government needs to provide a strategic regulatory environment to ensure the lights stay on at an affordable price
6590088 the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action
6590089 this proposal offers to put more money in the pockets of poorer consumers by reducing their outgoings and providing for weekly budgeting to avoid debt
6590090 we are deeply concerned about the effects of household price rises on hard pressed families and other vulnerable people
6590091 we reached an agreement with them to treble the amount they spend to help the poorest this will provide an extra 225m over the next three years and could help 100 000 households who struggle to keep their homes warm in the winter
6590092 knowing the flight number of the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece
6590093 technicians supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6590094 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6590095 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life
6590096 the plane would have been designed to continue its climb if an engine failed on take off and pilots are certainly trained to cope with this but the hotter the weather is the harder it is for a plane to climb
6590097 conditions at madrid would certainly have been hot which degrades both aircraft performance and engine power so may have reduced the aeroplanes ability to climb this may have caused the ground impact and subsequent fire
6590098 if it is correct that the aircraft was taking off and skidded off the runway this sounds like an aborted take off
6590099 this could be due to a number of things including engine failure however it is a well practised event in simulation and air crew are trained to respond to emergencies in the correct way
6590100 it points to other failures in the aircrafts systems it is not logical that an engine failure caused this aircraft to crash there must have been something more this possibility could correspond with a major problem in the hydraulic or electrical systems
6590101 let me have a look into this and get back to you later today
6590102 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly

6590106 when you are lying in the hospital bed and feeling so drained feeling so much pain and so tired you dont want to think about next month or next week all you are thinking about is the next hour
6590107 this taught me just to be patient lie in your bed and just wait thats almost the same strategy i used here to stay at the back be patient and stay easy waiting for your chance
6590108 i have struggled so much in life and to be able to have so much victory seven years ahead thats awesome

6590118 i do not think i should have to explain to a nine year old what this word means children will use words that they are not supposed to when they are out of earshot
6590119 i suspect it was innocence on jacqueline wilsons part i cant imagine she would have used that word if she was aware of how much it would offend
6590120 there are words which are considered offensive in our society and therefore we should not use them in books for kids
6590121 but there are a lot of other places they are getting access to those words besides jacqueline wilson books such as mtv and other channels not aimed at children but readily available to children
6590122 it should be a 15 rating at the least it is cruel sadistic and paints a bleak world view and yet any child of any age can go if their parents take them and parents assume if its a 12a it must be ok
6590123 jacqueline wilson aims to reflect the realities of modern life including dialogue in her books
6590124 children do hear a wide variety of language in the playground and through this learn what is and isnt acceptable and also how language demonstrates mood and feelings
6590125 in the context of the character we felt the word was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie and her friends would speak to each other and it also contributed to the readers understanding of how jodie felt in the situation
6590126 the publisher is aware of the word featured in the book and has agreed its not appropriate for children and will be reprinting copies as soon as these copies are available we will stock them in our stores
6590127 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another this case is important because it highlights how easy it is for uk offenders to move around freely when overseas
6590128 cinema is less expensive than other leisure pursuits despite financial pressures people still need to get out of the house and forget about their worries we expect comedies and adventure films to do particularly well this year as we look for escapism
6590129 history has shown that in times of economic hardship consumers find even more value in home entertainment as video is one of the most cost effective forms of entertainment we would expect to see continued volume growth in our market as consumers tighten their belts
6590130 the money is there to cover the bill and they are hoping to get the order annulled next week
6590131 western leaders anxiously watching for a withdrawal and puzzling over how to punish moscow for what they called a disproportionate reaction to the georgian offensive

6590134 this would not prevent very large powerful patent holders from rejecting offers
6590135 its a game thats big for the fans i guess its for a little braggin well they have the ultimate braggin rights they won the super bowl
6590136 they accomplished something that a lot of teams werent able to do they played a great team that had a lot at stake also to see them actually be the underdogs they were and go out and perform they way they performed was eye opening i was amazed by how they played
6590137 i watched all of that they achieved something that every player wants
6590138 to be able to watch it not be a part of it but be a witness of it that was a good thing
6590139 brett favre brings an added dimension of his own as far as his notoriety and his fame he has a lot of fans
6590140 so this game will be big itll be a good lead up game to the start of the regular season
6590141 they got us last year in the regular season pretty good
6590142 we jumped out on them pretty quick and they came back on us it was a difference from preseason to regular season
6590143 they have great players out there theyre a great team now theyre just like every other super bowl winning team trying to get it again this year trying to repeat but i dont see any cockiness on their side
6590144 if they knew the plane was faulty why did they let it fly
6590145 those responsible say it will take two days at most to finish identifying people by their fingerprints
6590146 what they really want we cant give and the longer it takes the worse it is
6590147 its been years since engine failure on take off or a fire has prevented a flight from continuing
6590148 the monstrosity of heroism when our fidelity to the cause compels us to transgress the threshold of our humanity
6590149 in political terms the difference between classical tragedy and modern tragedy is the difference between traditional tyranny and modern terror the traditional hero sacrifices himself for the cause he resists the pressure of the tyrant and accomplishes his duty cost what it may as such he is appreciated his sacrifice confers on him a sublime aura his act is inscribed in the register of tradition as an example to be followed

6590151 the exact reversal of the aim of the first enlightenment

6590171 the international olympic committee has ordered an investigation into mounting allegations that chinese authorities covered up the true age of their gold medal winning gymnastics star because she was too young to compete
6590172 an ioc official told the times that because of discrepancies that have come to light about the age of he kexin the host nation s darling who won gold in both team and individual events an official inquiry has been launched that could result in the gymnast being stripped of her medals
6590173 the latest unofficial investigation was carried out by stryde a computer security expert for the new york based intrepidus group whose site stryde hax revealed a detailed forensic search for ms he s age
6590174 the bright critics assembled in this volume will doubtless show in
6590175 its not a matter of forcing people its getting them to want to use it if you cant youre not going to do great advertising

6590180 we want to know the structure and composition of the soil at the surface at the ice and in between to help answer questions about the movement of water either as vapor or liquid between the icy layer and the surface
6590181 i can see that type of consensus starting to form in october
6590182 but prior to the season starting and with no tangible evidence to use it is absolutely ludicrous
6590183 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

6590187 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6590188 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6590189 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6590190 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6590191 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6590192 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6590193 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6590194 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6590195 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6590196 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6590197 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6590198 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6590199 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

6590201 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6590202 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6590203 patent threat scare tactics against free software are frequently used but have never been backed up
6590204 germanys approach is the sensible and traditional innocent until proven guilty and puts the onus on the mud slingers removing the payoff that proprietary vendors get from this anti foss free and open source software tactic neither the never ending sco story nor the notorious and pointless patent deals could continue if other legal systems took the same common sense approach
6590205 sco cant say in germany that linux violates scos intellectual property or that end users could be liable for violations of scos intellectual property or that linux is an unauthorized derivative of unix unless it can prove it

6590222 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6590223 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccain s world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6590224 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6590225 the question isnt how many homes mccain has but how many homes does mccain have where he got a sweetheart deal involving tony rezko
6590226 patients are given extremely low expectations theyre told theyre sick and not capable of overpowering it
6590227 were told that we have to not face life and thats not a life worth having
6590228 the biggest thing that were about is saying youre capable of having an absolutely wonderful life but it takes hard work to get there
6590229 i dont claim to be an expert i claim to be someone who can pull the expertise out of someone else
6590230 we find that when we gain insight and we gain understanding we can be stable even when were depressed a certain stability happens when we learn how to deal with it and it leads to the right behavior the advantage is we understand something that few people ever will
6590231 id like to use education and warnings as a first step rather than shutting off the water
6590232 with a child you have to give your full self
6590233 i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6590234 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
6590235 fun retro illustration work by this is my tumblr email me tell me what you think
6590236 online video streams surpasses number of searches in december 2007
6590237 this concert is support for the people of south ossetia and for the justified military actions of russia
6590238 it is also against the cynical position of the united states everywhere they go there is war
6590239 it was brutal and criminal i have talked to about 20 or 30 people on the phone who were there and everybody tells me this one story
6590240 there was a massacre in which more than 2 000 ossetians died there are villages that no longer exist
6590241 intelligent people around the world should know the truth about what happened here especially on the first night
6590242 we still dont know anything because they havent been identified
6590243 the girls grandparents identified the body they were devastated it was terribly painful
6590244 i have lost my nephew who had come from orlando and today was his 23rd birthday
6590245 i took a child into the truck and he thought he was in a film but he asked when will this film end and where is my dad he asked if it was real if he was in a film but he wanted the film to end
6590246 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash
6590247 i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6590248 when i woke up i saw bodies spread all around
6590249 my daughter has been reborn its a miracle granted by god four days before her birthday
6590250 i said i didnt mind paying extra to go first class whatever it took just get me on that plane
6590251 but there was no way it was completely full so we had to wait till the next flight that overbooking saved our lives
6590252 the plane was overbooked and i was offered two options to bump up to first class or wait for another flight which is what i decided to do then half an hour later my brother called me and told me what had happened
6590253 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6590254 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6590255 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6590256 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6590257 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6590258 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6590259 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6590260 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6590261 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6590262 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6590263 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6590264 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6590265 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6590266 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6590267 my dad is a loving man and he didnt deserve this
6590268 my dad opened his arms up to this guy let him in his life and then i feel like he was betrayed
6590269 my family and i are experiencing grief that is indescribable and at times unbearable every time i close my eyes the images in my head are of my dad in flames screaming hollering and running for his life while on fire in excruciating and traumatizing pain
6590270 they said the first 24 hours were critical he made it through the first 24 hours with no complications he made that first hurdle the doctor informed me today that his body is fighting hes a fighter
6590271 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6590272 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6590273 consume over 12 months enough energy to power 11 500 homes
6590274 i havent gotten around to thinking about canadian right now im following the american one very closely
6590275 i dont know whether our politicians are more bland here or what but theres no zip to it
6590276 the fact that there is an election in united states is not a major issue what the prime minister will propose as an agenda in the parliament is a major one
6590277 the information will help the city work with the banks to develop better ways to resolve the issue
6590278 the economy has changed so much it needs to be looked at again
6590279 this is an important piece of development for the city and the sooner we can move it forward the better
6590280 the city needs to take a closer look at todays economics and where we are going as a region to give us
6590281 nothing is cast in stone anymore we knew from the very beginning this project had to be fluid you tweak things as you learn this is one of those things
6590282 we will not ditch the plans entirely just change them a little
6590283 this will not be rubber stamp of the three core items in the draft
6590284 there is a need for a balance between quality tenants and not overbuilding
6590285 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
6590286 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
6590287 that gave us an insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing
6590288 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
6590289 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since ronald reagan
6590290 trying to look as if they give a c p about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
6590291 the democrats have pumped in 8 million dollars for those ads they have made elizabeth the no 1 target in the nation
6590292 she cant raise that kind of money much of the money has come from hollywood calif she cant raise that kind of money i dont know how the negative ads will turn out elizabeth ran against erskine bowles the last time and he was a real gentleman
6590293 she has been in public service for her entire career

6590297 queremos analizarla queremos estudiarla y ver en qu coincidimos para trabajar en septiembre octubre y noviembre en esta reforma
6590298 hemos puesto a todas nuestras oficinas en la mayor alerta estamos buscando cualquier cosa sospechosa y nuestro personal est en cuarentena a partir de ahora
6590299 they were later arrested in new york city where the plan was to bomb a subway that arrest came from sharing information
6590300 is another tool to share information not only among law enforcement agencies but by citizens as well
6590301 nuestra intenci n es pegarle a los delincuentes donde m s les duele en el dinero y en su red de protecci n
6590302 impulsaremos tambi n leyes m s modernas eficaces y espec ficas para que el gobierno federal no tenga pretextos para prevenir perseguir y castigar el secuestro el narcotr fico el robo con violencia y la trata de personas
6590303 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6590304 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6590305 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6590306 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6590307 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6590308 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6590309 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6590310 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6590311 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6590312 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6590313 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6590314 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6590315 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6590316 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6590317 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6590318 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6590319 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6590320 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6590321 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6590322 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6590323 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6590324 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6590326 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6590327 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6590328 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6590329 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6590330 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6590331 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6590332 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6590333 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6590342 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6590353 the county board has typically moved forward with projects that have outside funding available
6590354 is to maintain the quality and life of the countys investment in the road
6590355 we have also identified the potential costs of bringing our system fully up to date
6590356 we see a lot of crashes on roads that cant support existing traffic volumes
6590357 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6590358 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6590359 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6590360 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6590361 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6590362 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6590363 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6590364 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6590365 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6590367 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6590370 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6590371 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6590372 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6590373 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6590374 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6590375 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6590376 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6590377 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6590378 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6590379 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6590380 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6590381 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6590382 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6590383 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6590384 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6590385 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6590386 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6590387 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6590388 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6590389 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6590390 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6590391 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6590392 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6590393 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6590394 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6590395 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6590396 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6590397 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6590398 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6590399 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6590400 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6590401 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6590402 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6590403 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6590404 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6590405 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6590406 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6590407 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6590408 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6590409 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6590410 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6590411 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6590412 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley

6590414 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6590415 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6590416 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6590417 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6590418 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6590419 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6590420 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6590421 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that
6590422 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play
6590423 when he gets hot he does do some crazy stuff
6590424 if you drive the ball well you have some birdie chances and if you dont you struggle to break par
6590425 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man

6590427 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6590428 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6590429 a total of 15 556 subjects answered the questions on snoring
6590430 these factors may enhance inflammatory processes and thereby alter upper airway anatomy early in life causing an increased susceptibility for adult snoring
6590431 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6590432 these new findings suggest that further knowledge about the early life environment may contribute to the primary prevention of snoring

6590443 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe

6590446 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6590452 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6590453 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6590454 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6590462 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6590463 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6590464 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6590465 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6590466 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6590467 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

6590470 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6590471 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6590472 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6590473 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6590474 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6590475 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6590476 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6590477 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6590478 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

6590488 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6590489 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6590490 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6590491 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6590492 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6590493 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6590494 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6590495 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6590496 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6590497 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6590498 this report from wisdom is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time

6590539 our take home message today is that the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6590540 wtc 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires
6590541 it is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved
6590542 this is the first time that we are aware of that a building taller than about 15 stories has collapsed primarily due to fires
6590543 what we found was that uncontrolled building fires similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event the collapse of wtc7
6590544 even without the structural damage wtc 7 would have collapsed from fires
6590545 these uncontrolled fires had characteristics similar to those that have occurred previously in tall buildings
6590546 the fires in wtc 7 would have been controlled and the collapse prevented
6590547 connections that were designed to resist gravity loads but not thermally induced lateral loads
6590548 for the first time we have shown that fire can induce a progressive collapse
6590549 hypothetical blast events did not play a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6590550 found no evidence whose explanation required invocation of a blast event
6590551 would have resulted in a sound level of 130 db decibels to 140 db at a distance of at least half a mile

6590561 what im missing here is why are we doing this
6590562 the more important role is to maintain the sense of community and this is missing the tie to the neighborhood
6590563 any time you create a plan its basically to encourage development over a certain area and if were increasing density of development then that has a neighborhood impact
6590564 where i see the commission lacking is a unified vision on things of that nature where do you strike the balance of resurging development and complementing the residents concerns
6590565 theres absolutely no buffer in the area it goes from multi story commercial to single family residence

6590585 we are not prepared to deal with the implications this has for our planet
6590586 the message is very clear they want banks to hike lending rates by 50 to 75 basis points till the banks do it and there is a plausible impact on credit growth the rbi will continue to raise rates

6590590 i think we have got to show people outside of northland what we desire

6590595 this suggests that pass through in case of administered petroleum products is still incomplete
6590596 this optimism stems from the fact that global brands like louis vuitton and frette are already looking at india as a manufacturing base for their products while others are sourcing their requirements from india
6590597 corporatisation of the luxury sector will bring along with it concepts of organised and innovative marketing leading to large investments employments and generating additional revenue streams
6590598 as the dynamics governing it were significantly different in nature
6590599 one of the key steps towards facilitating the development of the retail sector and in accelerating its growth would be to further ease foreign direct investment in the sector the constant back and forth on policy decision on retail at the centre also acts as a dampener for luxury brands
6590600 the indian tariff structure also needs to be streamlined india has one of the highest duties and taxes on imported luxury goods which drive the grey market and duty free purchases while the stringent regulatory environment impedes investment by foreign brands

6590603 the outlook for the dollar is intertwined with oil prices
6590604 the recent weakness in oil could be the result of declining demand and as such could be more than a dip or at least a very long drawn out dip
6590605 its not a typical inflation its influenced by global factors
6590606 outlined the steps taken by the government to sustain the growth momentum and curb inflation in the face of external pressures on account of rising crude oil prices
6590607 he also referred to various initiatives taken by the government to make the growth process socially inclusive including measures taken to insulate the poor to the extent possible from inflation
6590608 we cannot allow the subsidy bill to rise any further nor do we have the margin to fully insulate the consumer from the impact of world commodity price and oil price inflation

6590622 the nuclear deal will now come to a logical conclusion the economic reforms will re commence
6590623 for long there has been a hide and seek game going on between the left parties and the upa government over the civilian nuclear deal with the us
6590624 left leaders were creating hurdles in implementing some decisions like foreign direct investment in insurance sector
6590625 the government can now think of opening up the insurance sector
6590626 the left leaders were never creative in their approach about issues of national importance they were acting more as activists than responsible coalition partners
6590627 the pace of reforms however will depend upon the kind of support which the government now gets from its new allies like the samajwadi party
6590628 food prices have also been on the rise thanks to foolish diversion of food to fuel
6590629 please remember terrorist violence has affected bigger cities like london madrid tokyo new york
6590630 if terrorist violence terrorist action affects any city in india it concerns all of us but that does not mean that investment has been jeopardised or is in peril
6590631 but surely the way forward is to become an open market
6590632 also a big challenge for us to keep pace with our growth
6590633 it is happening we have to have huge investments in energy sector ports so thats all happening thats on the anvil
6590634 rest are all absolutely open and we are taking in investments
6590635 we have been self sufficient except in edible oil and lentils which are imported and unless we have a monsoon failure we dont see a problem even with these growing numbers
6590636 we call ourselves the fastest growing free market economy and there are differences in governance too
6590637 but china has its own genius we have our own genius

6590642 rising oil prices commodity prices and food prices are a global phenomenon and these cannot be influenced through the monetary policy
6590643 it is therefore important that the authorities take a relook at the anti inflationary package
6590644 these results can be interpreted as an acknowledgement of reserve bank of indias tight monetary stance and of a further tightening of monetary policy in the near term given the present inflationary situation
6590645 all these factors together have put a huge dent on the margins and on the operating performance of companies forcing many of them to partially offset this pressure through an increase in prices
6590646 food prices have also been on the rise thanks to foolish diversion of food to fuel
6590647 please remember terrorist violence has affected bigger cities like london madrid tokyo new york
6590648 if terrorist violence terrorist action affects any city in india it concerns all of us but that does not mean that investment has been jeopardised or is in peril

6590650 the 25 day long agitation has led to losses of above rs 7000 crore to various industries and specifically railways
6590651 the major blows fell on the railways and tourism industry also the disruption of railway freight traffic caused production delays in many parts of the country
6590652 the figures do not include the losses of property and damages done to railway tracks
6590653 more than 1 000 trains were either cancelled or diverted or terminated before their destinations during this period
6590654 the freight corridor between mumbai and delhi via rajasthan was the worst affected due to the blockade and the movement of container trains dropped to less then 50 per cent between jaipur and delhi
6590655 we have already opened many lines and the lines passing the worst affected areas will be opened after 18 20 hours the repair work of the track has already started
6590656 however for some time we will put speed restriction of 20 km per hour for the trains in the affected areas
6590657 a team from railways will go for inspection and will repair the broken tracks then only the complete railway services will be restored the process will take one or two days
6590658 we still believe that crudes rallies are vulnerable and we would advise not buying into them

6590662 we are working with over 800 000 schools across the country to make education more interactive and creative the schools depending on their financial strength also bear a portion of the cost incurred and as most of the schools we are working with are in the rural areas we have also employed ngos

6590672 there has been only 5 to 7 percent increase in food prices while in other countries prices of farm articles have shot up to 80 percent good crops will certainly help in moderating prices
6590673 a series of efforts like availability of quality seeds and adequate quantity of fertilisers along with the hard work of farmers have contributed significantly to enhanced crop production
6590674 good monsoon gives us the hope to have a better yield
6590675 the production of coarse cereals has gone up by 6 8 million tonnes pulses by one million tonnes and oil seeds by 4 5 million tonnes in 2007 08
6590676 these estimates are based on the feedback from states and validated with the information available from other sources
6590677 what we are witnessing is not a natural disaster a silent tsunami or a perfect storm it is a man made catastrophe and as such must be fixed by people
6590678 i urge the group of eight countries in concert with major oil producers to act now to address this crisis this is a test of the global system to help the most vulnerable and it cannot afford to fail
6590679 record oil prices and high and rising food costs threaten a growing number of countries with rising poverty and social instability already we have seen food riots in over 30 countries and unrest over high fuel prices is spreading the urban poor are especially affected by the double hit of food and fuel
6590680 improve the worlds ability to cope with an on going food crisis
6590681 the international community is facing an unprecedented test in this new era of globalisation the question is whether we can act swiftly to help those most in need
6590682 for globalisation to work successfully and achieve its promise it must be inclusive and sustainable this means acting now in the interests of the poor who are most affected by this double jeopardy of food and fuel crisis and who are least able to help themselves

6590685 first i held up three fingers to represent trinity and he raised a finger to remind me that there is still one common god in both religions
6590686 well first he said that we muslims had three days to leave jerusalem so i said fuck you then he said that the whole jerusalem should be cleared from muslims i told him that none of us would leave
6590687 then he pulled out his lunch i pulled out mine

6590694 stratford and act have an amazing synergy both are actor driven theatres deeply rooted in the classics
6590695 i am amazed at the muscularity of stratfords acting company who perform major classics in repertory for eight months in 2 000 seat houses in particular seana mckenna is a remarkable talent capable of keeping act audiences on the edge of their seats through racines erotic and complicated tragedy
6590696 there is a case for insulating the poor a much weaker case for insulating the general consumer there is some case because we dont want to shock them too much but very little case for insulating the rich
6590697 so the fact is yes if oil prices keep on rising the government will have to do something
6590698 i think i have no hesitation in saying that there is no magic bullet with the government that if import prices increase we cannot insulate the domestic consumer indefinitely
6590699 i think the fact is there has been generally a resistance in the country to see higher fuel prices all we have done is give a signal that if energy prices rise then the people have to get ready to pay more
6590700 i am not talking about waiting for years i am saying that in a few months time certainly by september october we will be in a much better position on the inflation front
6590701 that is the problem you are putting too much emphasis on the so called dream solutions
6590702 i think this sea has become a little choppy so we have had an external set of circumstances that have imposed some difficulties
6590703 i think the ship is steering pretty much in the direction it should
6590704 a small section of the oil analysts has been ascribing the relentless rise in crude prices in recent months to the spurt in demand for oil from india and china i wish to take this opportunity to set the record straight
6590705 and with steadily declining energy intensity both our countries are registering rapid economic growth with less than proportionate increase in oil demand
6590706 significant factor in ensuring stable and orderly growth of world economy
6590707 given these facts we are of the firm view that attribution of high crude prices to rising demand from india and china is completely devoid of merit and misses the wood for the trees
6590708 while we agree that fuel subsidies may have a negative impact on the energy market in the long run the current volatility in international oil prices and its potential for destabilizing emerging economies makes state intervention in pricing of life line fuels inevitable

6590720 rising oil prices rising commodity prices and rising food prices are a global phenomenon and these factors cannot be influenced through the monetary policy it is therefore important that the authorities take a re look at the anti inflationary package
6590721 industry is under tremendous cost pressure on account of rise in the prices of raw materials oil and oil products and rise in power costs wages and salaries and interest burden
6590722 their hr execs spending their entire existence trying to hang you out to dry youre not alone
6590723 retail and manufacturing establishments continue to be the key employment providers in india said s k nath director general of the central statistical organisation cso which compiled the census it is a significant pointer that india has a great deal of potential for growth in these two sectors
6590724 this census gives us a complete picture of indias economic situation we must interpret the data intelligently there has been a rapid growth in small scale industries
6590725 billions of entrepreneurs how china and india are reshaping their futures and yours
6590726 unlike china where companies are state and government led in india it is peoples own money
6590727 imperialism is laying the seeds of global chess with indian companies naturally capitalising on their shared history
6590728 the increase in petroleum product prices has contributed 94 percent to the inflation recorded
6590729 double digit inflation was expected after the government decided to increase fuel prices
6590730 its a difficult time more strong monetary measures are needed the government is aware of the difficulties
6590731 our estimate of losses does not include the inconvenience caused to passengers who were stranded at stations and disruption to goods transport
6590732 added to this is the huge losses that the tourism sector in rajasthan and some parts of uttar pradesh have suffered
6590733 at least 75 trains including six rajdhanis and the lucknow bound shatabdi from here were delayed and 23 trains were cancelled
6590734 the tight monetary policy stance taken by the reserve bank of india has led to a decline in demand in the economy affecting industrial growth which has declined from 14 8 percent in march 2007 to 3 percent in march 2008
6590735 in addition to rising interest rates the appreciation of the rupee has also taken a toll on industrial performance and this explains why india missed the annual export target for 2007 08 by almost us 5 billion
6590736 the government should draw up a long term development policy for the entire manufacturing sector in terms of subsidies development of raw material base regulatory and procedural reforms as well as directions for monetary and exchange rate management to help the growth of the manufacturing sector
6590737 about 59 percent of the retail price in bangalore and karnataka are central and state levies in the form of sales tax entry tax excise duty and cess making the cost of petrol highest in the country
6590738 but the basic price of petrol itself includes 23 percent excise duty and three percent cess on it while the maximum retail price mrp includes freight cost and dealers commission
6590739 retail pricing of petrol and diesel is a very complicated process as the basic price includes refining cost customs duty on import of crude landing cost etc
6590740 similarly a one percent reduction in excise duty on diesel has brought down the central levy to rs 3 600 per kilolitre from rs 4 600 cess of three percent on reduced excise is rs 108

6590743 were now projecting the four largest economies in 20 25 years now the summary line is its the century of asia
6590744 the number one economy in the world will be china were debating over whos number two is it the united states or is it india number four will be japan of course
6590745 now if you think about four of the largest economies in the world either being in asia or having a footprint in asia our west coast it makes you think about how the next century might unfold
6590746 think of it as a cliff that falls off the edge
6590747 for those two reasons india and the united states in addition to being democratic societies that tend to solve problems its a much brighter future
6590748 al qaeda who wishes this nation great harm is enjoying a de facto safe haven in a region of pakistan about the size of new jersey
6590749 last year we observed a cell we knew who they were we watched them their intent was to have mass casualties in germany against a us military facility and against a german government facility we tracked them we coordinated with the germans we arrested them and theyre in jail today
6590750 its an exciting mission its around the world from code breaking to spy satellites to human agents recruiting other human beings
6590751 we have worked to achieve deep penetration of those who wish us harm i would argue its very effective
6590752 it is important that the people of iraq freely determine their political future and exercise control over their natural resources once this happens perhaps an easing of the price burden could be expected
6590753 i believe that it would be helpful if iraqi crude oil begins to flow once again to its full potential once the iraqi oil is again in the market the overall spin offs are going to be large not only for the global economy but also for the iraqi people
6590754 this massive volatility is already having a negative impact on the global economy and is likely to retard growth and development
6590755 in the meanwhile the government faced with the present situation found that there was no viable option but to increase oil product prices
6590756 it is clear that the oil price hike is externally induced it is not simply indian economy that is bearing the brunt the entire global economy is facing this crisis with the developing countries taking on an unbearable burden
6590757 for this we would have to increase our primary energy supply by three four times and electricity generation capacity by five six times by 2031 32 power generation capacity would need to be increased to nearly 8 00 000 mw from the current capacity of around 1 60 000 mw
6590758 in my view nuclear power appears to offer india the most potent means to realize its long term energy security
6590759 the price of food is skyrocketing around the world and its women and children who are most at risk because of the emerging food crisis
6590760 at the current rate we can project that 1 2 billion people would become chronically hungry by 2025
6590761 the increase in food prices is adding another layer of vulnerability particularly among women and children
6590762 policy action and programme action need to be implemented to mitigate the impact of increasing food prices
6590763 i am sure the indian government can control the situation but if food prices continue to increase it will lead to people skipping meals and staying hungry
6590764 economic growth can be sustained by good economy and policy while inclusive growth can be sustained only through good conscience
6590765 industry should desist from non competitive and cartel type behaviour
6590766 i feel that management boards of directors and employees of companies must be driven by a refined social conscience and social responsibility and not by short term gains
6590767 demonstrated resistance to increasing personal freedoms higher inflation from food and other commodity costs as well as increased burdens on entrepreneurs also held the worlds most populous nations back as business destinations
6590768 privatisation of government owned industries remains stalled and continues to generate political debate populist pressure from within the upa government and from its left front allies continues to restrain needed initiatives
6590769 we analyze business climates in each of more than 120 national economies focusing on degrees of personal freedoms like the right to participate in free and fair elections or freedom of expression and organisation
6590770 it is one of the biggest loots witnessed by mankind the loot of the aam aadmi common man since 1947 by his brethren occupying public offices what is even more depressing is that this ill gotten wealth of ours has been stashed away abroad into secret bank accounts located in some of the worlds best known tax havens and to that extent the indian economy has been stripped of its wealth
6590771 we cant talk about limits we couldve talked about limits when venezuela proposed that price band with a floor of 22 a barrel and a ceiling of 28 which was working well until the war in iraq pulverized it
6590772 the world economy has to assimilate that price just as we do our economies we have to assimilate the high prices of agricultural machinery of medical equipment and of medicine

6590776 the destruction of the islamic khilafah state over 80 years ago marked the beginning of dividing the muslim world into countless nation states governed by a plethora of kings dictators and western backed democrats
6590777 i think the statement just gets to the basic fact that the world and the international system is changing
6590778 certainly nobody in the us is trying to single out a government or nobody in the united states is expressing the sentiment that it is not a good thing that there is greater calorie intake among more people around the world than ever before
6590779 and the fact that you have greater economic prosperity around the world whether its in india or china or elsewhere around the world and as a result there are different standards of living a positive sense that is good for the international system
6590780 that really speaks to some of the goals that were expressed at the inception of the current international financial economic and political system when you look back to the immediate post war period in 46 47 48 its a positive thing
6590781 so again im not sure what prism people are viewing the remarks through but i would encourage them to not look at them in a way that is intended to single out in a negative fashion the people of india or anybody else around the world
6590782 a global platform for dialogue and action to manage the food crisis
6590783 the entire issue of food prices needs to be seen in a global perspective and not just as an issue emanating from specific countries
6590784 there is need for greater flow of global information on food production and consumption and cuts in food wastage
6590785 we are setting up a task force to look into this area
6590786 include diversion of food to bio fuels changing weather conditions across the globe leading to droughts which mean lower food production in several countries and huge agricultural subsidies which encourage leaving agricultural land fallow to maintain global prices of agricultural products
6590787 revolutions in communication and technology have sent jobs wherever theres an internet connection that have forced children in raleigh and boston to compete for those jobs with children in bangalore and beijing
6590788 we live in a more competitive world and that is a fact that cannot be reversed
6590789 each time weve kept our economy strong and competitive by making the decision to expand opportunity outward to grow our middle class to invest in innovation and most importantly to invest in the education and well being of our workers
6590790 weve done this because in america our prosperity has always risen from the bottom up
6590791 there is nothing protectionist about demanding that trade spreads the benefits of globalisation as broadly as possible
6590792 because we know that we cant or shouldnt put up walls around our economy a long term agenda will also find a way to make trade work for american workers
6590793 we do the cause of free trade a cause i believe in no good when we pass trade agreements that hand out favours to special interests and do little to help workers who have to watch their factories close down
6590794 for all of george bushs professed faith in free markets the markets have hardly been free
6590795 to high priced lobbyists who rig the rules of the road and riddle our tax code with special interest favours and corporate loopholes
6590796 those who see biofuels as the driving force behind recent food price increases have overlooked not just one elephant standing right in front of them but two
6590797 the first elephant is the huge increase in demand from emerging countries like china and india these countries are eating more meat it takes about 4 kg of cereals to produce one kg of pork and about two kg of cereals to make one kg of poultry meat so a dietary shift towards meat in countries with populations of over 1 billion people each has an enormous impact on commodity markets
6590798 however long term price rises are not an entirely bad thing they could be good news for the 70 to 80 percent of the worlds poorest who live in rural areas and depend on farming for their livelihood here we can do much better with our development aid
6590799 understandable at a time when food prices were lower but not any more
6590800 this vote shows the overwhelming level of support across the funds membership for these reforms and i thank the members for this resounding endorsement
6590801 i see this result as the beginning of the new legitimacy of the fund
6590802 the new structure represents an important step toward a redistribution of voting shares toward dynamic emerging market and developing countries and we expect to see a continued shift over the next decade
6590803 in particular the tripling of basic votes reflects an innovative part of this reform effort aimed at enhancing engagement and voice of our low income members
6590804 to preserve this element of the reforms the package includes a mechanism that will keep constant the ratio of basic votes to total voting power in the imf
6590805 its the same as you would do with a dog or cat in pain
6590806 he was listless was having trouble breathing was not really staying afloat the way a whale should
6590807 her mother handed her to us and the woman stayed behind there were too few firefighters at the beginning
6590808 the girl was totally disoriented she did not complain or talk despite the great number of serious injuries which she had
6590809 this fireman has become perhaps without intending to the hero of the day
6590810 kept asking me if it was true what was happening
6590811 he thought it was a film and he kept asking where was his father and when the film would end
6590812 the more prosperous the world is the more opportunity there is
6590813 so for example just as an interesting thought for you there are 350 million people in india who are classified as middle class thats bigger than america their middle class is larger than our entire population
6590814 and when you start getting wealth you start demanding better nutrition and better food and so demand is high and that causes the price to go up
6590815 now some of that is not so much declining production as apparently improvement in the diets of people for instance in china and india and then pressures to keep food inside the country
6590816 i believe as i told you the interim step to getting away from oil and gas is to go to ethanol and battery technologies for your automobiles
6590817 i think it makes sense for america to be growing energy id much rather be paying our farmers when we go to the gas pump than paying some nation that may not like us
6590818 the level of m amp a activity in recent years suggests that the expected reward is much stronger
6590819 we are witnessing a fundamental shift of the global business landscape with companies all around the world eyeing the potential of these countries and ramping up their investment and presence
6590820 india is expected to continue in the same position in the next season as well as in addition to us farmers growers in other countries are also inclined to shift to the production of soybeans and wheat besides corn
6590821 the organisation will continue to strive for a stable and balanced market with prices that reflect fundamentals and are favourable to both producers and consumers
6590822 the turmoil in some global equity markets and the considerable depreciation in the us dollar have encouraged investors to seek better returns in commodities particularly in the crude oil futures market this has driven prices higher
6590823 india has 53 up from 34 the year before four indian billionaires are on the top 10 list of the worlds richest people more than any other country can claim
6590824 its the way they are taking their companies and in the process their country forward the companies they are building are not just big bold and brawny in the chinese model but smart nimble and surprisingly modern
6590825 hopefully it will be an important stimulant to the economy
6590826 not all is behind us but we have made progress
6590827 we hope we will begin to see a slight improvement in the overall economy in the back half of 2008
6590828 if the french results hold up it would indicate that cell phone induced brain tumors can develop more quickly than current hypotheses suggest

6590833 ive had surgery and have been on chemotherapy too last month the doctors did second look surgery and the tumors gone completely
6590834 i knew it was time to give the rosary back
6590835 at night i held on to it just physically held on i was so lonely and afraid
6590836 yet when i gripped that rosary i felt as if i held a loving hand
6590837 the nurses told me a coma patient can still hear
6590838 so i explained to my mother that i had mother teresas rosary and that when i gave it to her she could let go it would be all rosary in her hand right away we saw her face relax the lines smoothed out until she looked so peaceful so young
6590839 when youre through needing it send it back someone else may need it

6590846 almost 60 percent of bric service providers expect a rise in business activity over the coming year and only around two percent of firms anticipate a decline
6590847 confidence was highest in the indian service sector around 60 percent of firms there expect a rise in activity while none expects a decline
6590848 the more prosperous the world is the more opportunity there is
6590849 so for example just as an interesting thought for you there are 350 million people in india who are classified as middle class thats bigger than america their middle class is larger than our entire population
6590850 and when you start getting wealth you start demanding better nutrition and better food and so demand is high and that causes the price to go up
6590851 now some of that is not so much declining production as apparently improvement in the diets of people for instance in china and india and then pressures to keep food inside the country

6590885 what our findings show is that these measures of automatic mental association have the potential to perhaps improve the prediction of election outcomes
6590886 this is based on earlier research in our lab and from other people that automatic mental associations have the potential to distort reality
6590887 its this distorted interpretation of information that has the potential to affect future decisions
6590888 one should not make the mistake of thinking of these measures as a replacement for the standard methodology
6590889 this didnt do anything for decided voters its more of an addition and this addition is particularly useful for figuring out where the undecided voters might go
6590890 a lot of researchers are actually doing studies with these measures over the internet
6590891 so if you recruit a representative sample in the population and in addition to your phone interviews you direct people to a web site thats certainly feasible to do
6590892 you can compare it to a thermometer that gives you higher or lower numbers but at this point you cant match it to a point where the water is freezing or boiling

6590907 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6590908 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6590909 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6590910 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6590911 i must read them daily and often check in more than once
6590912 if x seems to be a good move cant we also play it in student ys line
6590913 i like this position better than the one we had before because moves g and h are included
6590914 i just try to get a little bit better each time
6590915 i love the fact that it is a never ending puzzle there is always something more to learn even in this camp people have found things that caused my jaw to drop we are not even close to solving chesss mysteries despite computers i also love that chess is a pure meritocracy its pretty cool that in this day and age a seventeen year old is fifth in the world there are few areas where a seventeen year old can beat a forty year old
6590916 going in i was white in a grunfeld and ftacnik has written books on this opening going in i had some preparation but i didnt know precisely which line he played i am happy with the game because i felt my play was very positional accurate at some point he made a mistake and allowed me an interesting exchange sac although i think by that time i was already somewhat better so i had an endgame with two bishops and a rook against two rooks and a bishop but i also had a secure passed pawn on a6 and was able to win its probably the only game i ever played where i felt like i really outplayed a gm
6590917 not letting them just sit back and do what they want
6590918 it was in the new jersey futurity last year and was my first win against a grandmaster i built up a good attack my opponent wasnt necessarily worse but the position was very unclear and he couldnt figure out how to solve all of the problems i set for him the game finished with a nice tactical blow
6590919 before this i had not had good results against ims
6590920 but these wins marked a new level for my chess
6590921 but i dont see chess as a profession i do think however that i will always play
6590922 its a beautiful game with so many possibilities i love the thrill of playing not necessarily winning but the thrill of competition i also play a lot of sports but the feeling of competition is different there perhaps because chess is a mental game
6590923 tennis is a very strategic game sometimes you play one way and it isnt working so you have to adapt change your strategy find your opponents weakness also like chess you have to work very hard to improve at tennis
6590924 i like the philosophical questions science fiction raises and the different ways of viewing the world it can suggest
6590925 but i like positions where i have at least some counterplay i prefer when i have a clear plan but can set my opponent some difficult choices
6590926 gets a lot of satisfaction from playing to the best of my ability
6590927 i definitely play for like a hobby but before tournaments i try to study at least an hour a day i do think i will play chess all my life but im not sure ill study all my life i wont try to be a chess professional
6590928 even when i get worse or losing positions i never give up ive won an amazing number of lost positions because i set a lot of obstacles for my opponents
6590929 partially im too lazy to study them but i also do think that kids get fewer endgames than other people
6590930 people seem to assume that kids are good at tactics but i dont think thats always the case
6590931 when you win everything else in the world seems unimportant for about ten minutes
6590932 i dont really think i hate losing that much ive had a couple bad losses but i get over it losing is not a disaster for me
6590933 it was a sharp opening very tense and then i sacked a pawn for an attack i felt like i had really great pressure throughout i won nicely in the end but he only made one mistake the entire game
6590934 id like to make international master although i dont know if thats possible before college
6590935 it was an up and down game plus it was high stakes with a win either of us would have taken a big lead in the tournament
6590936 i went in trying to win each game i was up a pawn for nothing in one game but in the others i didnt have much of a chance before the match i would have thought id do better but now i would expect to score only about 95 against joel although id think id do better in 3 0 and probably id do better on icc also because i could pre move
6590937 in tactical games you can get overwhelmed theyre just riskier one mistake in a tactical game and youre dead
6590938 i know tactics are very helpful ive found if i do tactics before tournaments i do really well
6590939 i dont see myself as a chess professional but i think i will play chess for most of my life school is also very important to me id like to be like vinay bhat he didnt focus on chess much while he was in school but now he has a good job and is also a gm
6590940 i wasnt expecting to do so well i didnt think i could compete with players like daniel yeager who was rated 2350 and tyler hughes who id heard was very underrated but when i tied for first i realized for the first time how well i could actually play i started off 3 0 beating yeager this inspired me and allowed me to be myself when i was playing the remaining games not doing anything crazy or playing scared like ive done before when playing up
6590941 daniel was rated a hundred points higher than me and the game was complicated i had to make a lot of decisions in one key position i had won a pawn and both queens were attacked yeager then used his queen to take my bishop so then i had a pawn for a bishop i had two options one i could take a piece and equalize material but he would have all the play my other choice was to accept a rook and pawn for two pieces it was extremely complicated i looked at a couple lines and they seemed ok but i couldnt figure the whole thing out still i felt i had to go for it daniel ended up making a critical error i managed to whip up a decisive attack and ended up winning nicely
6590942 when you solve puzzles you only focus on two skills calculation and planning but games show you many more general ideas for example in one of daniel yeagers games that we analyzed he had a serious space disadvantage and consequently his pieces were not so good i kept trying to find ways for him to play actively but couldnt make anything work benjamin showed us that sometimes you have to accept a structural disadvantage in exchange for activity i really learned a lot from that in addition benjamin focuses a lot on openings and its allowed me to see how complex opening ideas can be
6590943 you practice in similar ways training specific skills but in basketball the skills are even more specific than in chess when you practice tactics youre never doing it with the expectation that you will get exactly that position but shooting free throws its pretty much the same each time
6590944 i dont think for me in either sport its about being competitive as much as it is about loving the game when i love something i want to do it well
6590945 in my game against shabalov i checkmated a very strong player whom i have a lot of respect for the erenburg game was completely opposite a positional crunch
6590946 it came to me when playing that the conventional plan of f4 f5 g4 g5 g6 in the kings indian attack is very different when black has fianchettoed his king bishop i understood then that i should play h4 h5 which both saves time and keeps the g4 square open for the white queen
6590947 because of all the girls obviously no seriously i like to attack people and rip their kings apart
6590948 ill maneuver around for a while and then about move 35 when i have six minutes and my opponent has three ill open the position up and hope for the best i think its important to stay about three minutes ahead on the clock
6590949 spent a lot of time working on chess with my partners in crime josh friedel david pruess and vinay bhat
6590950 i want to conquer the world no seriously i want to improve myself both as a player and a person
6590951 perhaps just i want to be less outwardly competitive since being competitive is an important part of who i am as a person but ive definitely been working on this lately
6590952 the world has so many problems global warming the oil crisis pollution poverty these are so much bigger than chess and i want to do my part to help
6590953 actually id like to be a spy id have the perfect cover i could travel around playing in chess tournaments id be one of the top players who would suspect me
6590954 except i guess if the people i was spying on knew how to use google then theyd read this interview and figure it out
6590955 if you are playing a really big game in the last round the feeling of adrenalin and focusing to achieve a result is very cool it can be also very relaxing sometimes if you are stressed out its like a release of emotion it helps you chill
6590956 yeah of course what i really hate is that so many people immediately assume girls suck even when im on top board people always think im the lower rated player i remember one experience visiting a chess club in san diego and everyone immediately presumed i was a beginner my first opponent barely even looked at the board when he played me he talked to other people read the newspaper
6590957 but only because he wasnt paying attention though right if he had been he would have crushed you easily
6590958 we know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time not only so but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies for in this hope we were saved but hope that is seen is no hope at all who hopes for what he already has but if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently
6590959 god given restraint in the face of opposition or oppression
6590960 we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose
6590961 put on the full armor of god so that when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand your ground and after you have done everything to stand stand firm then

6590977 as barack obama prepares to accept the democratic nomination this week it is clear that the economic policies of the next president are going to be hugely important
6590978 john mccains economic vision as he has laid it out during the campaign amounts to a slightly altered version of republican orthodoxy with tax cuts at the core obama on the other hand has more detailed proposals but a less obvious ideology
6590979 belief in market based regulatory principles rather than command and control
6590980 one place i do disagree is with obamas belief in the value of some aspects of reaganomics i think both obama and the article give reaganism too much credit
6590981 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
6590982 he also says he believes that there are significant parts of reaganism worth preserving so his policies often involve setting up a government program to address a market failure but then trying to harness the power of the market within that program our author is worried that obama believes all this as i said above if thats all he means i have no problem with this idea in fact my criticism is that he seems to depart from this when he actually implements policy however i do understand he needs to get elected and that a stronger populist appeal may be needed but he seems to go beyond this in his embrace of reaganomics
6590983 i will be the build america president and put americans back to work with a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest 60 billion over ten years and generate millions of new jobs that cannot be outsourced
6590984 finally i should also say that i was impressed by what i heard from obama in terms of his knowledge of economics

6591059 the international community must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy
6591060 genocide can occur anywhere it is not an african phenomenon we must have global vigilance and never again must we be shy in the face of the evidence
6591061 of course there were heated debates on the phone no one person attacked each other publicly i still feel the same way about this organization as i did last year last game of the season im just glad to still be a part of it and i have faith that i will retire as a ram

6591075 does this person or should this person care what im doing today
6591076 i spotted joe quickly but he was trying to hide from the crowds by tucking in between a few people
6591077 he was wearing a baseball cap and real casual dress so he wouldnt stand out
6591078 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area
6591079 but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
6591080 shes a great girl i think anybody would love to go on a date with her
6591081 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him

6591108 the university of san diego has violated the principle of academic freedom and we expect more from a catholic university that states their intention to uphold the highest standards of intellectual inquiry and academic freedom as one of its five core values
6591109 rosemary radford ruether is a highly respected world renowned theologian and usds shocking treatment of her has inspired thousands of catholics from around the world to take action and express their support for her and for academic freedom
6591110 public position and the symbol of this chair are in direct conflict
6591111 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6591112 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6591113 but in motor sport its often whats under you what counts not how good you are so thats probably why they dont do it
6591114 and i understand now why my mother was whittling all the time because i know what his lap times should be so when hes even one second late coming round that corner you cant believe the tension the best feeling is when he crosses the flag at the end of the race but its unbelievable when he crosses it and hes winning like at knockhill last week leons first win of the season i get as much fulfilment seeing him win as i got from winning more because being big headed i always knew i was going to win
6591115 yeah because you get that drive from inside yourself from the time he was eight i made him clean the van clean the bikes and i knew that would show me whether his heart was in it by the time he was 12 i knew he really wanted it it was him who had the drive it wasnt me driving him
6591116 ive broke my femur my tib and fib ive had skin grafts muscles removed collarbones wrists and arms broken but it doesnt make you fearful just determined not to make the same mistakes again
6591117 you have so much self belief you never think anything bads going to happen
6591118 phil was the third youngest and his death hit us all big time
6591119 with terry i sponsored him and if i hadnt then he wouldnt have been there but i deal with that by saying that he was doing something he really wanted to do he was 42 and phil was only 24 but it doesnt matter how long you live if youre doing what you want then its a fulfilled life you can live to be 100 but if you never love what youre doing youve never really lived
6591120 it happened to me five or six times in the isle of man especially in early morning practice when theres a lot of fog on the mountain when you cant see hardly anything at 130mph 140mph youre going on rhythm but once that rhythm gets broke it becomes frightening for instance theres a kink in the road and normally you straight line it but in thick fog you take this kink as a corner that breaks your rhythm and you panic for 20 or 30 seconds but then you get your speed back and pick a tight corner up and your rhythm comes back
6591121 thats the ultimate class but its so political to get in there with the right machine
6591122 our lap times in the british superbikes are pretty much the same as wsb but the worlds best can repeat them more consistently so thats what im aiming for
6591123 its unique were definitely more like brothers im only at home about one night a week because of all my commitments but whenever i am we go trialling for hours
6591124 not really i used to but i came to realise they were to help i used to think he was a grumpy old git but having someone with his experience in your corner is fantastic saying that no matter how much advice someone gives everyone in racing knows youve still got to twist that throttle yourself
6591125 i must admit that at first i thought he was a bit stuck up but i came to respect him a lot he did so much for the sport
6591126 hes still very good but ive got the edge now
6591127 we have a whale whose condition has deteriorated rapidly over the last 24 hours and who now experts are telling us is suffering and weve had to make the hard decision to euthanize the whale

6591132 what islamic movements ie hamas hezbollah etc would you consider worthy of your support or what new ones should we create
6591133 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6591134 there is no clear evidence that positive or negative experiences can affect breast cancer risk emotional stress is highly subjective and difficult to measure accurately
6591135 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
6591136 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
6591137 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
6591138 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
6591139 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine
6591140 the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes
6591141 either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the minds eye quite as much as of the bodily eye

6591144 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event
6591145 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6591146 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6591147 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down
6591148 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6591149 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building

6591155 i would like the people of the area to put the guns down and stop the crime
6591156 i want to ask the jamaican people particularly those in maxfield avenue to hold down the crime i am from that area and at one time it was good to live there
6591157 i know that if we can control the crime we can get back to that point
6591158 we need to stop the violence and come together as one
6591159 i never heard of melaine walker before and look at what she has done for the area already
6591160 i want to appeal for peace so that everyone can live in peace and love and unity
6591161 melaine survived through tough times and her father as well as high school coach raymond graham would ensure that no matter how many shots were being fired she would get home safely
6591162 this shows you that people from the ghetto can rise and conquer the world
6591163 i am thrilled im overwhelmed im incredibly excited but im not intimidated
6591164 i have to admit i had a lump in my throat when i saw christine ohuruogu win that 400 metres i thought that was unbelievable and that really put paid to everybody who says britain can only compete in sports that involve sitting down
6591165 i certainly dont think you can overlook human rights abuses and on the other hand i dont think that you are necessarily going to achieve what you want in this context by show boating and grand standing and that kind of thing
6591166 id rather that we use the excitement of the games and we use the opportunity to open china up to the world to help the chinese to understand why people care so much about it across the world
6591167 i dont think we would have necessarily done the switcharoo with the girl with the braces

6591196 the key thing is to make sure the guys that can produce plays for you get the ball
6591197 those players become pretty apparent to the opponent early in the season as well as theyre already apparent to us
6591198 people quickly come up with ideas in terms of how to deny those guys the ball
6591199 either through the scheme in getting the ball to somebody else or getting that player loose you have to do a good job of getting them the ball
6591200 so it is very challenging to us to make sure that that occurs and then to be ready for the what ifs as other people have schemes up against us
6591201 with certain coverages its possible defensively to take almost anybody out certainly we would be in the same category against other teams what price are you willing to pay for that or what consequences are you willing to suffer for taking somebody out
6591202 its usually possible especially with receivers with how you double your coverages or roll your coverages to one side or the other or put different combinations on it if thats the intent if thats what a defense wants to do it can often be accomplished sometimes the price is greater than the gain if you have multiple weapons or other things in your scheme to get the ball to other people then hopefully offensively we can extract the price with those types of approaches

6591249 la resoluci n tal como est ahora no contar con el apoyo de mi gobierno y para nosotros sigue siendo importante que se reafirme la integridad territorial de georgia
6591250 nadie puede considerar que se encuentre cerca de la zona de conflicto
6591251 los seis puntos sin clarificaciones nos hacen temer que se ponga al consejo en la posici n de respaldar algo que no se respeta
6591252 seguro que hay diferencias entre nosotros sobre esta materia pero m s adelante ya tendremos ocasi n de discutirlas
6591253 when we opted out we told major league baseball it was not a negotiating tactic we need a new deal
6591254 baseball is really really important digital content because of the volume of games and the time of year they play
6591255 if they have the rights in a country they have the rights to stream
6591256 this is the first time we ve allowed someone to stream live games and we do it with a lot of thought they understand rights and they treat rights appropriately while i think it s a value for value exchange and its fair for both sides we wouldnt have done that with many other potential partners
6591257 espn and fox are such large national partners were duty bound to negotiate with them theyre so vital to the industry that if they wanted to do something wed have to work with them very hard
6591258 putting this stuff online doesnt really keep people from watching your television bowman i must give him credit also understands he can build his online business and work with me on building our online business
6591259 it seemed to make sense to us in some ways its helpful to promote mlb tv
6591260 we believe in our content and were grateful that espn does too
6591261 its not cannibalistic if all of it is ours its hard to resist things that are good for your customers if you keep trying to keep people from tivo ing things or not get games ultimately youre going to make your customers mad
6591262 we understand the importance of local rights economically philosophically and baseball was wise to set up the system they have when the time is right and in the manner that is right it will occur maybe in five years but no one knows there are so many important stakeholders her the fans the rights holders the affiliates theres just a lot of stakeholders here maybe the nba will start down a good path and well see
6591263 if we have exclusive rights we expect to be the only way to get there
6591264 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6591265 hey listen if im going to be the first black president ever lets be honest im gonna need someone who can catch bullets
6591266 charts the highs and lows of a celebrated part of music history
6591267 a winding inviting portrait of a bohemian quarter that played a prominent role in the foundation of rock music
6591268 a fast and wild ride strewn with a list celebrity anecdotes and affectionate contextualising of some of the great rock records of the 60s and 70s
6591269 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6591270 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6591271 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6591272 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6591273 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6591274 required a carefully choreographed effort between new york and massachusetts power companies safety officials police departments and state troopers in two states and the patience of motorists
6591275 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6591276 this is a planning took where all things are going
6591277 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6591278 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6591279 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6591280 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6591281 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6591282 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6591283 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6591284 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6591285 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6591286 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6591287 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6591288 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6591289 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6591290 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6591291 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6591292 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6591293 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6591294 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6591295 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6591296 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6591297 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6591298 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6591299 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6591300 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6591301 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6591302 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6591303 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6591304 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6591305 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6591306 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6591307 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6591308 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6591309 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6591310 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6591311 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6591312 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6591313 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6591314 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6591315 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6591316 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6591317 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6591318 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6591319 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6591320 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6591321 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6591322 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6591323 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6591324 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6591325 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6591326 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6591327 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6591328 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6591329 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6591330 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6591331 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6591332 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6591333 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6591334 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6591335 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6591336 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6591337 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6591338 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6591339 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6591340 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6591341 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6591342 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6591343 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6591344 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6591345 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6591346 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6591347 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6591348 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6591349 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6591350 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6591351 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6591352 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6591353 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6591354 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6591355 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6591356 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6591357 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6591358 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6591359 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6591360 her mother handed her to us and the woman stayed behind there were too few firefighters at the beginning
6591361 the girl was totally disoriented she did not complain or talk despite the great number of serious injuries which she had
6591362 this fireman has become perhaps without intending to the hero of the day
6591363 kept asking me if it was true what was happening
6591364 he thought it was a film and he kept asking where was his father and when the film would end
6591365 a 50 year old man has been charged after a woman was sexually assaulted
6591366 anthony david atherton born 02 03 1958 of victoria road heaton was charged with attempted rape threats to kill false imprisonment and possession of a class a drug on tuesday 19 august 2008
6591367 he appeared at bolton magistrates court on tuesday 19 august 2008 and was remanded in custody

6591394 more categories are likely to follow as consumers feel more comfortable and retailers get their delivery models right making returns easier
6591395 there has been a lot of work done here to improve the fulfillment mechanism and in distribution and customer service where the greatest challenge is for multi channel retailers to leverage and integrate their distribution networks

6591403 persistent block storage has been among the top requests of developers using amazon ec2 and we
6591404 first amazon ec2 rewrote the rules of cloud computing offering companies an intuitive and reliable means for accessing unlimited computing power with amazon ebs amazon has turned the industry on its head again providing unlimited storage potential
6591405 amazon ebs has enabled us to create large scale enterprise level databases that allow us to run and maintain various disparate applications ec2 and ebs together provide a cost effective flexible system that allows us to crunch data faster than we had been previously able
6591406 with sun also recently making the opensolaris platform available on ec2 web companies can now access the unique features of the zfs file system such as rollback and 128 bit checksum capabilities to enable the highest level of data integrity on ec2
6591407 now with the highly anticipated release of amazon ebs our enterprise ec2 customers have the ability to persist virtual machine configuration and application data across instantiations and manage their cloud solutions in as consistent a manner as their on premise deployments
6591408 these are the types of capabilities our customers especially the isvs and enterprises are looking for
6591409 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
6591410 we recognize that to be thought of as the best we need to keep innovating which is what the new village and casino and ski resort expansion will do
6591411 we make a lot of traditional european things like croissants and pains au chocolat but theyre made as close to our opening time as possible not beforehand and then in small batches after that we operate as though we are baking in real time and we use valrhona chocolate in our pain au chocolat and use double the normal amount little things like that
6591412 here in san francisco i see less sweet desserts pastry chefs using a little less sugar and a little more salt and being more subtle and i see more familiar comforting desserts with the economy the way it is people want a chocolate layer cake and a piece of pie
6591413 i see a lot more assertive flavorings like herbs and spices in desserts we make a ginger spice cake in the winter and a sticky date pudding thats spiced assertively we also have a steamed ginger pudding made with freshly ground ginger pur e thats really hot and spicy
6591414 i always look for something that seems pretty straightforward and maybe familiar but that also has some element that i havent thought of
6591415 it should have contrasting elements for instance an affogato a coffee based dessert has hot and cold and with the espresso you have a strong flavor contrasting with the smooth creamy lighter flavor of ice cream
6591416 creamy desserts that are not too sweet like a panna cotta made with almond milk blancmange
6591417 any kind of pie but coconut cream pie in particular and cannoli

6591421 its the expectation of most of the suppliers that all this visibility that china is getting is going to make asia as a destination seem more knowable and more reachable than it has in the past
6591422 most of those olympic host cities had a tendency to increase prices
6591423 they thought everyone was going to rush in but their expectations were unrealistic the situation in china is different
6591424 the maturity of china as a destination is bringing new approaches to tourism

6591460 the popularity of baking and pastry has never been greater
6591461 it used to be a subset of culinary training but now its a career track within the profession itself
6591462 even in a down turned economy dessert is an affordable luxury
6591463 i think we still need to do things for ourselves and things that make us feel happier if youre looking for a comfort food dessert is one of those areas that people are going to turn to
6591464 we have people who look at the dessert menu before the regular menu so they can plan ahead
6591465 we used to laugh about that because when everybody was no carbing and low carbing and all that it didnt really affect our dessert percentage
6591466 it affected how much bread people ate but they still ordered dessert
6591467 i think people are going to do it no matter what
6591468 people are eating smaller portions and they want to be healthy but there are certain things they dont want to give up
6591469 theres only so much you can do with a nice piece of fish

6591473 its about molding it into something interesting innovative in a way someone might not think about
6591474 our first horizontal well in the qinnan block confirms that horizontal wells can be drilled at a low cost in the area we engaged a chinese company on a turnkey contract to drill this well at a total cost of approximately us 1 3 million based on these drilling costs and other results in the area we believe the qinnan block could potentially provide very attractive rates of return
6591475 3 2 9 when we interviewed a variety of individuals and groups involved in mr gs care we were struck by the different perceptions of the impact of a diagnosis of personality disorder on the care and treatment a person receives for example
6591476 when local authority a decided to withdraw from accepting any responsibility for mr gs care they stated the lack of an identified mental disorder as one of the major reasons for this had a person with another mental health diagnosis displayed the same level of apparent need we do not think that the authority would have made such a decision calums emphasis overall we were left with the impression of a man who was seen as difficult and challenging faced with this many practitioners and services appeared keen to accept any opportunity to distance themselves from his care
6591477 3 3 5 mr g was removed from the cpa care plan approach despite evidence of significant problems and needs for services this was on the basis that mental health services believed that they had nothing to offer mr g the effects of this included removal of clear lines of communication with the police and local authority a left to try to support mr g without psychiatric assistance
6591478 3 3 7 we found no community care assessment no risk assessment or risk management plan in the community care notes from local authority a we also found no risk of harm assessment or risk of sexual harm assessment in local authority as criminal justice records these are serious omissions
6591479 the problem is simply being shifted and not dealt with
6591480 3 3 7 continues again there is insufficient evidence that anyone at an operational or senior management level in local authority a took charge of the situation one of the operational managers told us that we were incorrect in assuming that the above memo i e of the problem being simply shifted required a response there was no evidence of a shared approach between agencies as to how to respond when mr g presented problematic behaviour
6591481 no one wanted to take responsibility for mr g either social services or health leaving the police to deal with an ill man
6591482 i wish to make a formal complaint about the inappropriate manner in which mr g has been treated by your department it became rapidly apparent that the current accommodation was unacceptable for mr gs care this was immediately brought to the attention of your staff and a case conference was requested to deal with the inappropriate behaviour of mr g and to consider how we could access something more acceptable we were constantly given assurances we accept responsibility for mr g unfortunately this did not materialise in essence we believe that an extremely vulnerable man was off loaded by your department because they were unable to address mr gs complex needs
6591483 no i have spoken to who is preparing a report for them in the meantime least said the better as i have encouraged to take these issues of home authority up with the scottish executive as our duties have been discharged under criminal justice legislation
6591484 i appreciate that you have kept staff advised of mr gs progress this was not invited as we continue to dispute any responsibility for him
6591485 i understand that mr g has been assessed by medical professionals as not having a mental health problem when previously resident in local authority a his behaviour resulted in eviction and he has exhausted the services that the council is able to provide in these circumstances he is considered to be responsible for the consequences of his actions if he presents at any council offices in local authority a he should be advised that the council will not take responsibility for his accommodation and that he must make his own arrangements
6591486 3 4 9 mr g was effectively left with no local authority prepared to accept on going responsibility for his care and treatment the state hospital social worker stated that he could think of no other similarly protracted case or one without resolution ccsw2
6591487 aghast at the way his mr gs case bounced around the local authorities at a senior management level
6591488 2 7 10 the mental welfare commission were contacted by dr8 and independently by the healthcare team at hmp b over the first few weeks of july 2004 they expressed concerns that mr g appeared to be suffering from mental illness but had been rejected by mental health services

6591490 extended stay is positioned so well right now because people are looking for value
6591491 you give up the bar and the restaurant but you have a kitchen and you get a lot of space
6591492 a family of four can save a chunk of change
6591493 i will choose extended stay lodgings while on vacation even shorter ones
6591494 with all of the other costs going up eating in the room can help to save money
6591495 we can share the cost of a room while keeping our privacy for sleeping
6591496 i like homewood because of the light supper they have and the hot breakfast
6591497 also its so much like a small apartment a separate living room the small kitchen the lobby is like a communal living room
6591498 extended stay has always been a great value but many leisure travelers are unaware of it there are so many different brands so many changes
6591499 so our guests had to go to our competitors we felt there was an opportunity for us to cater to business travelers on weekdays on weekends and during vacation periods families

6591534 we play with texture and emotions and create false expectations to show people you can push certain ingredients into sweeter realms than would be expected sometimes we focus on ingredients that we dont commonly experience in the land of pastry pushing and pulling ingredients to try to get them to fit into a progression and elicit those emotional triggers
6591535 theres a lot more creativity and attention to detail in pastry than in savory cooking which is what i like because i was originally going to go into art but i decided i like cooking more
6591536 inspiration comes from all places the seasons of course but also from looking at something unusual like uni sea urchin and saying i wonder if i could make this into a dessert make it appealing its a challenge
6591537 i make desserts that i know people want to eat
6591538 the thing i like most about pastry is that there are fewer boundaries with pastry all these excellent fruits and flavors really work well in any sort of texture whether its a gel or a liquid or something foamy
6591539 its all about whats at the peak of flavor whats available at this time of year that might not be available at any other time of year and how can we weave that into a delicious plate
6591540 pastry doesnt sustain the body we eat dessert purely to feel good to celebrate to share
6591541 its a lot easier to open a box and throw it up there but its not the same
6591542 we have a panna cotta on the menu right now and i dont think anybody in the south knew from panna cotta
6591543 but its southern in the sense that its made with local lavender from my garden and we serve it with a lemon shortbread and lemon sauce and local blackberries its taking a dessert from somewhere else and bringing it into our realm using local product
6591544 here you have more time to be more relaxed and when you take your time and put more love into it you get a better cake

6591555 producers can make films on their own dime if they wish to but they should not expect families to deduct taxes from their budget and then to use those taxes for anti family activities such as the films that we have mentioned
6591556 if private companies want to engage in such activity its not criminal in this nation and theyre free to do so but for the government to use to public resource to promote such degradation shows how detached the bureaucracy is from the canadian people
6591557 that to us is corrupting minds and getting them hooked on this material
6591558 it is to the public detriment to fuel an industry where women are degraded and treated as sex objects
6591559 para empezar la gente lo que quiere en esos momentos es una explicaci n que al guien les diga qu ha pasado y las preguntas en ese sentido se suceden por qu y por qu fue la m s repetida

6591601 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6591602 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6591603 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6591604 enable the risks of hrt to be reduced and its benefits maximized when the treatment is individualized to each woman
6591605 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6591606 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks

6591770 the students love to come and get involved in rural week each year
6591771 young in particular is very popular on the list of destinations though the students dont actually get a choice in second year
6591772 we always have a large amount of regional content in our syllabus as we recognize that not only is there a shortage of medical practitioners in regional areas but there are wonderful and rewarding opportunities out here as well
6591773 this year was especially interesting as we have begun to bring uc students into the program recognizing it is just not doctors that are in short supply in the country
6591774 there are great benefits to all the students from this inter professional learning that they get through sharing knowledge and health aims with each other at this early stage
6591775 we find that if students start working together with other health professionals at an early age and properly understand their scope of expertise they will be better able to integrate a patients whole treatment and better able to make the proper referrals needed
6591776 the students got a lot out of these activities this year and several have already expressed some interest in choosing to spend next year at the school here in young
6591777 human nature tricks us into believing that well all die from old age but its simply not true dont wait until a tragedy happens to realize that your life is meant to be lived to the fullest today dont wait until your anniversary to surprise your spouse with a night out on the town dont wait until your birthday to allow yourself the permission to pick up that ice cream cake from dairy queen yum dont wait until circumstances are perfect before you plan that spontaneous camping trip celebrate today
6591778 so let us consider making a movie for tween girls starring tween girls and doesnt involve them wearing short skirts shall we or indulging in bad movie banter i know i know im probably asking too much with that latter requirement fine if you make the film you can fill it to the brim with banter just show girls doing something other than teaming up with boys in an action movie and ill never complain again
6591779 after reading her essays about the true magic that comes from reading aloud i dont think this lady is exaggerating if reading aloud to children can turn them into smart inquisitive creative people then reading aloud may well hold the key to solving all of the worlds woes
6591780 is a book where the good and bad guys are never clearly defined
6591781 reading these two books had made me realize just how uncomfortable the shade of gray can be for most people
6591782 i have to admit that i think there is a lack of really great new kid mystery series there are some good stand alone books like elise broachs shakespeares secret but not the kind of series where you just want to read nine or ten of the books in a row in fact i could only think of three current mystery series at all however i fortunately like all three series and i can heartily recommend them as great chapter books for kids and teens

6591788 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information

6591802 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6591803 having the inside of the mouth of someone else it didnt belong to me it was atrocious
6591804 there were some good teams out there today and no blowouts by anyone on the course as a team we had a good score right around where we were last year in this event
6591805 it was a little easier this year than last year because most of us had played the course before
6591806 theres some tricky holes if you dont know how to play them and that screwed up some of us last year
6591807 its good to play against good teams right off the start its good to get us ready and to push us to improve
6591808 were a pretty young team but i think we can do well we just need to focus on section play and get into the playoffs then take it from there
6591809 i think in due time were going to build a nice base of players
6591810 i dont think were going to be section contenders yet but we have a lot of sophomores that played varsity as freshmen last year and they should be a little bit better
6591811 im looking for big things individually from colin this year
6591812 but the core of our team is sophomores and down the line theyre the ones that are going to have to make us competitive
6591813 we had the same group last year as sophomores playing varsity for the first time a lot of them were playing against seniors and werent very confident we were pretty passive
6591814 now as juniors theyve already done this before theyve already played varsity and theyre going to come back a lot more confident
6591815 its definitely a big loss but i think that with alexa well still have a pretty good offense
6591816 after a while i think well get used to not having christa around
6591817 you cant replace an all state player she was a very dominant player
6591818 i do like our chemistry we have a lot of younger girls that know each other and seem to be pretty unified we dont have any star players on this team but im hoping the whole ends up being greater than the sum of the parts
6591819 shelby is one of our strongest attackers and we have others who are capable but were still growing in that aspect of the game
6591820 without our defense we wont be able to pass the ball so weve been working on sticking together and playing defense as a team
6591821 we have to focus on serving and defense because we dont have a terribly tall team if you want to make a boxing analogy we want to make the other teams punch out and absorb enough on defense that it wears them down
6591822 i told the girls on the first day that no ones allowed to get hurt
6591823 unfortunately they switched our section and were in a very difficult section now
6591824 if we make the playoffs this year it would really be a great achievement
6591825 making the playoffs would definitely make it a successful season for us if we play defense and stick to what were supposed to do as a team then we should be ok
6591826 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say i want other people to know that 16 is my real age

6591831 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexual functioning also improved
6591832 even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in the quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains
6591833 the new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6591834 in fact the study found quality of life was actually lower in the women taking hormone therapy in the first few months of commencing treatment

6591841 when we got there she handed me a script and said here read this so i did
6591842 i was happy to do it because as you can see by watching the nightly news especially the sports how things have changed in the business
6591843 they used to let us do the sports and tell people whats going on in the world of sports now youve got espn so the television people figure if youre really a sports fan you tune there

6591897 vidaza however is also effective across a broad range of mds subgroups including who classified aml patients the largest subgroup in our study
6591898 the clinical data from this randomized phase iii controlled study demonstrated that patients with higher risk mds treated with vidaza benefit from a significant survival advantage a critical measure of a drugs effectiveness

6592052 i was working with joe henry producer of my previous record strange weirdos and moaning about the fact that i hadnt had a box set out yet
6592053 so we were discussing what would be on it and we came up with the idea that there would be three discs and a bonus disc of me taking some of my old songs and re recording them with this band of musicians we like to use we shopped this idea around and nobody seemed interested in the box set but the idea of this bonus disc stuck we still thought that was a good idea
6592054 because that is one of the songs i have continued to perform but a lot of them i hadnt so i had to go back and relearn a few of them and whenever i listen to that high keening voice i used to have i dont know if i like it its kind of an arresting vocal quality and i think it got people to notice me at the time
6592055 i made a point of not being booted or blue jeaned when you start your career you have to figure out a way to separate yourself from the pack so i went for a kind of preppy psycho killer look i had short hair grey flannel pants and a button down shirt i think it worked because nobody else was looking that way at that time

6592060 in that people expected and in some cases demanded that i sing it
6592061 as early as 1970 i was concerned about getting old theres a kind of through line in a lot of the material on the new record lines like in delaware when i was younger if i was 16 again id give my eye tooth and a couple of others so you can imagine how i feel about it now im 61

6592155 in both australia and new zealand rate increases are being implemented in line with rising claims costs and frequency while in commercial insurance we have ceded volume to maintain price discipline
6592156 while there is understandable caution among retailers the world over we remain confident that our multi brand multi region business model will deliver healthy growth and our forward orders support this view
6592157 however based on existing market conditions and assuming current exchange rates in particular an aud usd exchange rate of approximately us88 cents and an aud euro exchange rate of approximately 59 cents the group expects to deliver full year eps growth in the range of 8 per cent to 12 per cent in the 2008 09 financial year
6592158 a very pleasing result in any climate let alone in the prevailing economic conditions

6592160 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

6592168 if ryan trades dawson for any combination of players or draft picks he is out of his mind
6592169 i guess he had woke up and start smelling it so he was like mom mom wake up the house on fire it was smoking inside but the fire was outside
6592170 we were trapped in the house that way and everybody was just screaming
6592171 he just went back to try and save his momma and sister because all of them was hollering so he went back to try and save them but he never did get out either
6592172 we did know that number would rise and we very consciously made this announcement while it was on the rise to tell people in advance
6592173 they feel like theyre making good progress they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6592174 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6592175 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada
6592176 at this point we are counting on petro canada to have their processing unit back up within a reasonable time so that these closures will be temporary we have not made any decisions beyond that
6592177 you might see an impact if you had numerous refineries with an issue like this but so far i dont think that weve noticed any effect on the price
6592178 its great if youre a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6592179 but its not good for consumers and at times like this its not good for our operations either because we cant get any gas
6592180 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6592181 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6592182 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6592183 low officer levels have made the city one of the most dangerous in the country
6592184 in our opinion the houston police department is an undermanned seemingly rudderless ship

6592194 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
6592195 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
6592196 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
6592197 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
6592198 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
6592199 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
6592200 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
6592201 we really want to get the message out to people
6592202 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
6592203 who is supposed to be more on top of financial things than a bank but banks made all these terrible mortgage loans and caused these disruptions and we are dependent on them for our financial security
6592204 maybe its summertime but certainly theres 34 000 eligible voters in the city of santa cruz we mailed each one a ballot
6592205 if the tax fails its 200 000 a month expense to the city
6592206 so we will have to look at cutting back at our general fund areas like fire police parks and recreation
6592207 they can come back the next year actually the next day to come up with another proposal to scare the public to vote for 911 service all over again
6592208 love competition love risking your pride love winning it back love giving it everything youve got love the glory love the pain love sport even when it breaks your heart
6592209 we are about sticking by athletes through thick and thin
6592210 through injury and poor performances that is why sports are such an exciting field there are no guarantees there is heartbreak and failure as well as excitement and triumph
6592211 we have immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour
6592212 we want to act to protect our brand reputation in the same way as any corporation would want to if people were posting or writing false accusations
6592213 this isnt about a debate on freedom of speech its simply helping us to identify the person who posted it
6592214 its certainly had a tremendous toll on everyone thats involved emotional physical well get through

6592220 combined hrt improves sleep aches and pains and sexual functioning
6592221 these gains can now be factored in to a womans choice to use combined hrt this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualized for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen
6592222 womens international study of long duration oestrogen after the menopause
6592223 after one year small but significant improvements were observed in three of nine components of the womens health questionnaire for those taking combined hrt compared with those taking placebo vasomotor symptoms sexual functioning and sleep problems
6592224 no significant differences in other menopausal symptoms depression or overall quality of life were observed at one year
6592225 in many circumstances quality of survival is as important as quantity
6592226 this is an area not well handled in the past
6592227 we do know it is a very big issue especially for athletes retiring who can suffer long term considerable downs
6592228 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6592229 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6592230 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6592231 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment
6592232 for 10 years the vpmi professional has always been a simple sensible and supportable alternative for project management
6592233 with this latest upgrade we streamlined team collaboration and introduced dashboards throughout to cut down on meetings and project administration with budgets tight and energy costs spiraling people are looking for new ways to improve productivity while eliminating travel costs and overhead when they see how easily they can manage projects and the supply and demand of their resources the response is overwhelming when they realize we can exceed their expectations at a fraction of the costs of our competitors they vote with their feet
6592234 with the new version of vpmi professional there is a virtual home and role based toolbox for everyone
6592235 never before have we seen a project management package offer so much with so little investment of time and money the new version really opens up project management to the masses that previously was only available to the wealthiest companies and only usable by certified professionals these growth numbers really speak for themselves
6592236 saas adoption is highest in applications that support simplified common business processes or large distributed virtual workforce teams
6592237 ease of use rapid deployment limited upfront investment in capital and staffing plus a reduction in software management responsibility all make saas a desirable alternative to many on premises solutions and they will continue to act as drivers of growth

6592247 id always liked movies in a kind of naive way
6592248 they seemed no less improbable a career than anything else
6592249 i developed a kind of sales kit with slides and videotapes of actors all with a view to presenting investors with something that would look ready to shoot to my surprise they didnt pay too much attention to it they invested on faith
6592250 it was mesmerising it disarmed you it was a period piece and yet of all time it was extremely american it caught the spirit of the people of the culture in a way that was immediately identifiable
6592251 think of the gun in your hand as a magic wand
6592252 whatever you see in badlands is terrys style not mine
6592253 hes very strong visually he was always willing eager to change to things hed see something in the yard and say lets put that in the bedroom thats one thing i learned from him spontaneity
6592254 the shoot went on for ever because the crew kept quitting
6592255 they were completely brutalised theyd be setting up one shot over here then terry would look over in the other direction where the moon was rising up and hed go lets shoot over there i have these memories of everyone tearing off across the desert in pursuit of one sunset or another
6592256 i had a vested interest id fallen in love with sissy so that also kept me going
6592257 i can recall brian shooting with the slate upside down as a form of protest in a disagreement with terry about methods of orthodox coverage and matching shots
6592258 amazingly despite the input of these different hands the film looks remarkably seamless
6592259 except for the actors the art department was the only one that completed the film if the picture survived all those problems its because one thing was consistent terry malicks vision
6592260 people whove worked with terry either love him or hate him
6592261 i love him badlands was a real turning point for me wed spend hours talking about things and then the next day id look at the rewrites and thered be all the things i told him
6592262 holly seems at times to think of her narration as like what you get in audio visual courses in high school
6592263 when theyre crossing the badlands instead of telling us whats going on between kit and herself she describes what they ate and what it tasted like as though we might be planning a similar trip
6592264 she might have cried buckets of tears but she wouldnt think of telling you about it it would not be proper you should always feel there are large parts of her experience shes not including because she has a strong if misplaced sense of propriety
6592265 i will never be better than i was in badlands
6592266 he had a genuine gift it wasnt just an eye it wasnt just a facility with a camera it wasnt just an ability to write it was something inside him that was special he was the greatest director of his time
6592267 my mother was not remotely like that so for me its a glamorous romantic thing
6592268 i love the way its very feminine and i find a strength in that femininity
6592269 the cupcake is a real symbol of femininity and a camp symbol of a bygone era
6592270 anything which is very personal and behind closed doors and pleasurable for women is subversive these days
6592271 was to signify that there is nothing bossy or hectoring in my brand of domesticity the type of domesticity that i know so many women and a few men enjoy
6592272 i think it is a reaction to 1990s ladette culture and the sense of androgyny around that i dont like the idea that we are exactly the same as men i think it is damaging to womens self respect
6592273 i was really interested in the return of ideas like going for tea and cake and all this stuff that was considered twee for my generation girls in their 20s all my friends its a cultural shift almost a movement many people are fascinated by retro ideas i have always been fascinated by the postwar mentality
6592274 its coming back to something with a bit more value when everything today is so fast and technology is so advanced
6592275 its every womans choice if she wants to do these things
6592276 and i never want to judge another woman for the choices she makes and what gives her pleasure but there is something more serious going on here there are problems associated with domesticity because in the past there was the assumption that it was just what women did for a long time we have been saying to men you can do it just as well as we can but if we fetishise the frilly apron and the domestic goddess and the cupcakes then its much harder to say to men come and join us too
6592277 young women dont understand how hard it can be doing this real work if you dont have equality at home a lot of the freedoms and equalities women have won are quite fragile and at the moment we are in danger of moving backwards we have to continue to encourage men to join us and not exclude them
6592278 people think im an idiot and have no interest in feminism for me its about reclaiming traditional values and still being able to call yourself a feminist thats how i class myself but still people say how can you say that when you like to bake cakes but i dont like having rules and i dont like the idea that you cant do something because its un feminist weve been socially persuaded into being embarrassed about our femininity and now we want to embrace it
6592279 to me its not drudgery i will happily sit there for hours decorating the cakes its not a chore for me we love the big flouncy dresses we love seeing peoples reactions to the cakes its just a nice little thing that brings us joy
6592280 its about being allowed to be ultra feminine i think there is a real beauty about that time the 1950s because its so far removed i love looking at photographs of my grandma and what she wore at the time
6592281 there is a whole community of women out there who are into this scene reclaiming baking sewing and knitting its a choice and an aesthetic it links into environmental concerns and is a sort of a rebellion against consumerism i see it as a very empowering thing to do as a woman
6592282 thats why it can be seen as quite subversive because youre doing it as a single woman its for yourself i dont think men expect this stuff any more at all they are not involved in it its a very female led thing my boyfriend doesnt really understand he says what on earth do you do at the wi he has no idea and id much rather keep it that way
6592283 knowing the flight number of the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece
6592284 technicians supposedly fixed the problem which the pilot said was with the air conditioning and then we took off
6592285 the plane was wobbling from one side to another then i began to suspect we would crash i dont know what happened next i was in a sort of river and saw people smoke explosions which i think woke me up
6592286 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life
6592287 the plane would have been designed to continue its climb if an engine failed on take off and pilots are certainly trained to cope with this but the hotter the weather is the harder it is for a plane to climb
6592288 conditions at madrid would certainly have been hot which degrades both aircraft performance and engine power so may have reduced the aeroplanes ability to climb this may have caused the ground impact and subsequent fire
6592289 if it is correct that the aircraft was taking off and skidded off the runway this sounds like an aborted take off
6592290 this could be due to a number of things including engine failure however it is a well practised event in simulation and air crew are trained to respond to emergencies in the correct way
6592291 it points to other failures in the aircrafts systems it is not logical that an engine failure caused this aircraft to crash there must have been something more this possibility could correspond with a major problem in the hydraulic or electrical systems
6592292 it was a bit hard revising in cramped conditions and my sister was revising for her a levels at the same time
6592293 it was a bit stressful for a while especially when it came nearer to the exams
6592294 i had to concentrate with no space it was okay but i would have preferred to have been at home
6592295 this years superb results reflect the hard work commitment and dedication of our students we are delighted for them and their achievements are thoroughly deserved
6592296 i had no idea what i was going to get i wasnt confident and i wasnt anxious but i was so nervous before i picked up the letter i just did not know what to do i went green
6592297 our accelerated entry policy has also continued to be outstandingly successful with 76 of the year 10 students who took selected gcses in one year and one year early achieving a and a grade passes and 97 of all passes at a c we are very proud of them
6592298 faye helped me with my maths and science when i was revising because thats where i struggled and then she would shout at me because i did not get it
6592299 for many of the students their hard work has paid off
6592300 they have done really really well so were very pleased
6592301 american eagle had to ground nine embraer erj regional jets at chicago ohare airport on august 19 after
6592302 a member of the public was walking in castings avenue when she saw the car swerve and noticed a child banging on the back window shouting stop mummy driving stop mummy driving
6592303 she ran towards the car which had stopped and opened the rear door and took the child out of the car
6592304 she shouted for the accused to stop but she continued to drive in an erratic manner she careered over the carriageway mounted the pavement and hit a fence
6592305 the accused got out of the car and staggered across the street into a lamppost she was spoken to by passers by who said her speech was slurred she then tried to get back into the car but passers by removed the keys
6592306 she was arrested and taken to falkirk police station where the standard procedures were carried out
6592307 she realises she should not have been driving in that state and especially not with her daughter in the car she appreciates she needs help or her drinking is going to kill her
6592308 she can only have supervised contact with her daughter now
6592309 you endangered yourself and the public and you had your five year old child in the car exposing her to danger
6592310 given the gravity of the offences a custodial sentence is the only appropriate one
6592311 at the start of the ye advertisement ar we noticed demand was increasing
6592312 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
6592313 if youre a debtor ill make sure that everyone who knows you knows that you owe money
6592314 your neighbours your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that
6592315 then they do everything they can to make sure you dont come back and theres only one way to do that by paying
6592316 we have agreed that some goals some asp advertisement irational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6592317 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighbouring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighbouring countries and we already did clarify this
6592318 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6592319 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6592320 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6592321 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6592322 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6592323 we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible
6592324 sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices
6592325 we accept that the richmond families are our responsibility as they arrived directly into the sba
6592326 that said the sbas exist for military purposes only and we do not and should not have the infrastructure to support asylum seekers however we are going beyond our duty to help them here
6592327 id like to stay here but in a bigger house
6592328 its a good life for my children here its home my children were born here and i learned to speak english here
6592329 we cant have stateless people here its a military base
6592330 this episode highlights the burden these inquiries are putting on local authorities such as scottish borders council i understand it costs the council more than 20 000 each time an applicant appeals against a decision money that could be spent on front line services the council provides
6592331 in order to provide people with the best opportunity to assess this information the inquiry has been adjourned for five weeks
6592332 we are disappointed that the department for business is not minded to use its powers to limit the damage that high charges could do
6592333 we need to be clear that high charges will undermine our efforts to establish a thriving and diverse renewables industry in scotland
6592334 they would prevent the deployment of large wind farms in the islands and north of scotland and threaten the successful deployment of scotlands first and therefore most important fleet of wave and tidal projects
6592335 scotland is united against the national grids electricity transmission charging regime which works against the development of clean renewable energy in scotland
6592336 the scottish government scottishpower scottish and southern energy and the scottish renewables forum have already presented an unanswerable case to ofgem who responded positively to the need for change
6592337 the national grid have told us that they accepted the need for a review of charging
6592338 we will continue pushing our case for scotland until we have removed this unnecessary barrier to clean renewable energy
6592339 they are trying to produce power in areas away from demand centres and they are being charged unduly
6592340 i think we are definitely at risk of not meeting our targets unless we find solutions to these issues
6592341 our evidence base suggests the current level of transmission charges would not prevent otherwise economically viable renewable projects being built even in the extremities of scotland as shown by the significant capacity awaiting connection
6592342 we are clear that transmission charging levied on a user should continue to reflect the costs that user imposes on the network to get their flow of energy to the end user
6592343 this is because the further a source of gas or electricity is from its end user the more it costs to transport that energy to them
6592344 they believe the thief is from a nigerian background it appears he used one of andys statements as proof of name and address in a branch
6592345 he also phoned a call centre to open an account but it still didnt click and he took cash from a hole in the wall
6592346 its hugely embarrassing for the head of a banking group to be so lax with personal information that someone can steal his identity
6592347 after all banks are constantly warning customers to guard their private details
6592348 bank staff had to call andy on holiday to say they were freezing his accounts if it can happen to him it can happen to anyone
6592349 there is an opportunity for intel to help by bringing intels parallelism experience to more developers in the form of products to complement and extend microsoft visual studio for parallelism
6592350 will cater to windows c developers focused on new parallel implementations of their software using microsoft visual studio features such as support for linux and mac os fortran as well as advanced levels of optimizations and optimizer controls will remain unique to the existing compiler products
6592351 weve seen the situation but cant offer any more information
6592352 itunes is not being blocked in china from our end but access to the itunes store is restricted in some areas in china
6592353 a love of statistics which was to come in very handy when i became chancellor of the exchequer

6592355 the first few days looking at the land seeing where the holes should be were probably the most enjoyable ive had in my career
6592356 the course is like a living museum of golf its been designed in the spirit that old tom morris would have designed it
6592357 its probably now our greatest asset and one that other communities would die for
6592358 they have not got our consent they have no determination by the land court so how can they have an official opening
6592359 we will abide by the decision of the land court but are confident we can successfully defend the action
6592360 the money is there to cover the bill and they are hoping to get the order annulled next week
6592361 i think leukaemia has taught me to think step by step
6592362 when you are lying in the hospital bed and feeling so drained feeling so much pain and so tired you dont want to think about next month or next week all you are thinking about is the next hour
6592363 this taught me just to be patient lie in your bed and just wait thats almost the same strategy i used here to stay at the back be patient and stay easy waiting for your chance
6592364 i have struggled so much in life and to be able to have so much victory seven years ahead thats awesome
6592365 maartens had a cancer battle in the past and almost had to give up the sport
6592366 hes a complete gentleman a great ambassador for the sport and hes olympic champion now i said to him at the end that i was really proud of him hes a tough competitor
6592367 his storys amazing and can inspire people what he has achieved is phenomenal
6592368 this really does show how successful transplantation is in this day and age its really lifesaving it brings normality of life afterwards
6592369 seven years on from being diagnosed and he is most likely cured
6592370 armstrong says that positive thinking and doing a lot of sports can save you i dont agree i even think its dangerous because it implies that if you are not a positive thinker all the time you lose
6592371 the doctors and not just the power of positive thinking and my love of sport have saved me
6592372 seven and a half years ago i was fighting leukaemia because of the stem cell transplant i received i had the luck to recover
6592373 ted bundy serial murderer and necrophiliac martin luther king civil rights activist
6592374 for a number of years we lived at moffett field naval air station which is also where the ames research center is
6592375 we used to see astronauts come out there to do some of their training
6592376 a venezuelan football defender who is currently on loan to red bull new york of major league soccer
6592377 there are always some crazy things i get flashed quite often luckily mostly from girls
6592378 brown did very well at the start but i am now concerned that he has lost his grip
6592379 it is still possible that gordon will recover he still has two years to go if he could recover his grip i think we could still defeat tory leader david cameron at the next election although we have probably reached that secular moment as jim callaghan used to describe it when the country feels it is time for a change
6592380 until last year i thought gordon brown was the best labour prime minister since callaghan and callaghan was the best in all the time since atlee
6592381 we will see if he can recover i hope so because i like him but it is very very uncertain
6592382 first it was supporting the war in iraq then foundation hospitals and university entrance fees those three things were terrible mistakes
6592383 that would be a very difficult problem but not an impossible one
6592384 would have loved to have given mr brown some advice
6592385 this is especially true with subjects you think you are an expert in which is where gordon brown has gone wrong with the economy
6592386 choose good people to be ministers and stick with them
6592387 they should not stay too long this may be good advice for alex salmond in a few years
6592388 john majors greatest failure was that he got too worried about newspaper headlines
6592389 i do not think i should have to explain to a nine year old what this word means children will use words that they are not supposed to when they are out of earshot
6592390 i suspect it was innocence on jacqueline wilsons part i cant imagine she would have used that word if she was aware of how much it would offend
6592391 there are words which are considered offensive in our society and therefore we should not use them in books for kids
6592392 but there are a lot of other places they are getting access to those words besides jacqueline wilson books such as mtv and other channels not aimed at children but readily available to children
6592393 it should be a 15 rating at the least it is cruel sadistic and paints a bleak world view and yet any child of any age can go if their parents take them and parents assume if its a 12a it must be ok
6592394 jacqueline wilson aims to reflect the realities of modern life including dialogue in her books
6592395 children do hear a wide variety of language in the playground and through this learn what is and isnt acceptable and also how language demonstrates mood and feelings
6592396 in the context of the character we felt the word was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie and her friends would speak to each other and it also contributed to the readers understanding of how jodie felt in the situation
6592397 the publisher is aware of the word featured in the book and has agreed its not appropriate for children and will be reprinting copies as soon as these copies are available we will stock them in our stores
6592398 what is more scandalous is it is not the first time the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6592399 the british taxpayer will be outraged if they are made to pick up the bill for compensation to serious criminals
6592400 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6592401 we expect the home office to provide us with a copy of the internal investigation report and its findings we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6592402 todays double whammy on energy price rises will send consumers reeling soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6592403 consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6592404 consumers should look to pay by direct debit and move to an online plan if possible to get the best available prices
6592405 energy suppliers have to take steps towards covering their costs and i am sorry that we cannot delay these price rises any longer
6592406 although this will be little consolation these rises would have been even higher but for the fact wholesale prices fell a little in recent weeks people are naturally very concerned about the many financial pressures they face
6592407 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise this is a very tough time for everyone
6592408 this was not an easy decision and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6592409 we can confirm that mr gadd has left bangkok and is heading to the uk
6592410 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now
6592411 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6592412 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored
6592413 this case is important because it highlights how easy it is for uk offenders to move around freely when they are overseas
6592414 my aunt is easily as excited as i am about the forthcoming exhibition and her 100th birthday

6592418 it was impossible to leave such matters entirely to the indecent publications tribunal

6592420 but its time we remembered that public interest includes the defence of freedom as well as protection from pornography
6592421 with the increase of malware targeting home users and their information we felt it was imperative to give all people the same control over sensitive information that was previously reserved for it administrators

6592427 i sent it so long ago that i cant even remember sending it its just amazing that its turned up and my mum was especially pleased when she heard
6592428 we are delighted to have been able to reunite the owner with this piece of history
6592429 they are basically ignoring 21 000 people who made the effort to put in a response
6592430 this is a very worrying sign that the government is backing away from the world beating climate bill that they have promised
6592431 a climate bill that ignores international aviation is like a diet that still lets you eat chocolate it wont work
6592432 when the government themselves solicited tens of thousands of responses on the smoking ban they were delighted to count them all
6592433 however with more than 20 000 people telling the government to do the right thing by including flying in the climate bill it is hugely disappointing that they have gone out of their way to sideline these responses
6592434 unlike previous consultations the vast majority of campaign responses were based on a core script which individuals were encouraged to adapt the analysis of these responses took account of both the core script statement plus amendments and additions by individuals every single response was read and counted

6592451 may the cynicism that comes with age be matched by the profundity of wisdom
6592452 communism is beyond reform every attempt to liberalise it leads to its destruction

6592457 i cant believe amy winehouse self harms shes so irritating she must be able to find someone to do it for her
6592458 i know self harming is not funny but its just a joke so im not going to beat myself up about it
6592459 i saw zoes show and i saw that gag it made me laugh
6592460 i can see why thats the most popular joke because winehouse is in the paper every day shes a legitimate target
6592461 it makes you laugh doesnt it zoe has a very black sense of humour

6592476 this case suggests that facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily reintegrate themselves back into society
6592477 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement
6592478 if i give it away they wont pay me for it
6592479 what do my ideal customers want to receive by working with me
6592480 you have to catch ten sharks luckily they are nurse sharks
6592481 that for example are the sharks that are usually there
6592482 and the hardest part you have to catch the sharks with a net
6592483 having a very liberated sexuality does not prevent you from falling into the awful trap of jealousy and does not protect you from the pain which accompanies it
6592484 the care and the rigour with which they described to me their sexuality showed that in a certain way they wanted to be like me
6592485 if the mccain camp does that they will have effectively destroyed the republican party and put the conservative movement in the bleachers
6592486 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6592487 the rights of the unborn is one of my most important values
6592488 well watch the footage when we get out and youre going to look like an idiot
6592489 i did not hear rex telling us to give them to nicole
6592490 how do you think you got your name greedy mo
6592491 youre telling me im greedy youre the person who opens all the envelopes
6592492 i was trying to prove myself the whole situation pissed me off
6592493 we have a number of banks that are still under investigation and we are obviously having conversations about resolution the one thing the people want is their money back quickly
6592494 our guys did not find any powder there were maybe a couple of grains of something inside an envelope and they had to kind of work to get a sample
6592495 el piloto les dijo que fallaba el motor izquierdo y que no
6592496 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6592497 this takes a step forward in two ways firstly the use of bone as well as skin and next is carrying out this operation on someone with a benign tumour
6592498 there will always be limitations to this the main one would be a societal constraint a lack of suitable donors
6592499 however there is certainly demand for this with the major area being for people with facial burns
6592500 this particular surgery is a way of giving back a life to a patient who has been horribly scarred by burns trauma or a tumour
6592501 it was taking me about an hour and a half to go to bed every night because of checking light switches etc and if i felt like i hadnt done it properly id have to come back and do it again
6592502 it got to the point where id have to say definitively done mentally i was putting a tag on everything
6592503 id have this thing of looking at a light switch and seeing it was off but not being convinced of it and like i say in the song im a garbage man tonight and i just dont believe my eyes
6592504 id go outside and feel like i had to pick up the crisp packets outside my house before i could go to bed

6592510 my what a lovely blog i think ill go out and buy me a couple of brand new dell laptops
6592511 i think that any attempt to bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure
6592512 this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6592513 its the hearts and minds of the men in those locker rooms i gotta win im not worried about what the public thinks of me im worried about what those players think of me i lived in a locker room all my life i know what they expect out of me
6592514 i used to tape my ankles before i went to work
6592515 we liked the way pavano was throwing the ball and we felt that hughes needed some more work
6592516 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity if he can go six innings it would be great
6592517 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6592518 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6592519 obviously his command wasnt there his breaking ball wasnt sharp
6592520 i let a couple of them go and it felt good
6592521 when one guy is out there playing the game despite whatever is going on and somebody else is not thats how teammates get bad tastes in their mouths
6592522 i think hell be welcomed with open arms im not asking him to make amends im just asking him to come and compete
6592523 i just saw it as somebody who kept getting hurt
6592524 the way that owners are going all about this points directly to a lockout
6592525 ive made it clear to the owners that were not accepting a deal that pays us less than were already making
6592526 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6592527 its against detroit next tuesday thats where my focus is
6592528 i usually do a good job of getting out of those problems
6592529 its not like those errors would have ended the inning im not making good pitches after that
6592530 i had to battle the double plays were big give credit to the offense when you get five runs in the first three innings it gives you some cushion
6592531 youre going to get yourself in tough situations and you have to limit the damage
6592532 cliff has done a good job of that this season
6592533 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6592534 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did mahan said
6592535 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6592536 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6592537 i thought the scores werent going to be as low phil mickelson said after his morning 70
6592538 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6592539 the rough here is terrible said perry returning from an eye injury that forced him to withdraw after the first round of the pga
6592540 it never ceases to amaze me the pga tour perry said
6592541 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that did they quit after 15 or what
6592542 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play the irish star said
6592543 when he gets hot he does do some crazy stuff goggin said
6592544 if you drive the ball well you have some birdie chances and if you dont you struggle to break par
6592545 im really pleased i knew coming here that there would be a lot of attention on the ryder cup but i just had to try to get into the mind set of playing tournament golf rose said
6592546 i take it personally as a rematch because they beat us in 2006 and hopefully we can beat them gomez a coach on the 2006 squad said through interpreter sergio guzman

6592548 a lot of tears a lot of tears like most children in that situation venezuela manager freddy moran said through interpreter luis sanchez about his players after the loss

6592551 mr chretien has a lot of explaining to do when it comes to at the very least the appearance of conflict of interest

6592553 we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
6592554 china daily acts often as a mouthpiece for the government and it also signals how the government feels about an issue
6592555 the fact that this runs on the front page suggests china is very unhappy
6592556 the article here points to the fact that stephen harper has not visited china since taking office in 2006
6592557 for china a major superpower that is a big slight and they continue to hammer down on this point
6592558 but what we will not do is to sacrifice canadian values
6592559 we still dont want anything to do with you in the publics eye

6592617 a prescribed burn lowers the fuel loads in the forest so if a wildfire does occur it lowers the intensity and it doesnt create an undesired effect
6592618 basically we had a number of crews and engines and dozers out there
6592619 constructing line to put a fuel break between the fire and the closest town
6592620 we did pretty much a burning out a couple of days
6592621 but we did a lot of mopping up in areas
6592622 you can say fire cleans things up and promotes new growth
6592623 wasnt sure about how many houses he and his wife own
6592624 i think hes a solid defender in this league and a great leader
6592625 losing duilio he has really stepped in all we wanted to do was get drew moor into a central position i think hes a better center back than he is a flank back i think drew brings more of those leadership qualities part of leadership is communication and i think he does a good job of that he communicates well with everyone and they feel more comfortable back there i think in many ways drew is part of the reason we have found some success back there
6592626 i wouldnt say its necessarily a comfort thing i think i feel thats a little bit more my spot
6592627 i think in terms of comfort im pretty comfortable at right back because i have played there for a year and a half now center back comes to me a little bit easier because its easier to keep things in front and its easier with the ball ill step in wherever hyndman feels most comfortable with me
6592628 we communicate a lot its all about recognizing when to step when to stay and when to pass guys on he and i have a feel for each other i think a lot of that has to do with us being here for three and half years now and playing together all this time weve been on the field together a lot hes very versatile and that helps me and our partnership
6592629 obviously weve known each other for a while after coming out the same year its been 3 1 2 years that weve been playing together when youve been playing with someone for that long you know their tendencies and understand each other i think that helps a lot
6592630 i think hes shown versatility he played left back in college and has played right back and center back here i think hes comfortable in all those positions
6592631 i dont know where he prefers to play but i think he can play well at right back as well as at center back
6592632 weve done very well in our last few games i think thats what is important that we are working well together on defense it doesnt matter who plays where we are doing good work things are going well and hopefully we can keep it at that level or maybe raise it a little bit to benefit the team
6592633 with the personnel that we have on this team right now i think the 4 4 2 is better
6592634 you get the width with both midfielder and outside back defensively you have an extra guy in the back i think its just something that this team responds to a little bit better
6592635 it this year has definitely been a little bit of a rollercoaster ride but something that i think has helped me grow in confidence
6592636 ive gotten call ups which have been great ive gained valuable experience at the international level and want to hopefully continue to be called in i just want to continue doing well here for fc dallas
6592637 i think schellas hyndman has come in done a great job and the players have responded to him so well i think were starting to bring the best out of each other
6592638 i know im definitely excited about the last 10 games of the season and then going into the postseason i just want to continue to work hard and hopefully get some call ups as well

6592645 when you have a 71 year old presidential candidate its particularly important that voters be confident that hes backed up by an experienced and qualified vice president prepared to step in and do the exact opposite about everything except iraq
6592646 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6592647 we can take advantage of our cognitive surplus but only if we start regarding pure consumption as an anomaly and broad participation as the norm this not a dispassionate argument because the stakes are so high we dont get to decide whether we want a new society the changes we are under cant be rolled back nor contained in the present institutional frameworks what we might get to decide is how we want this change to turn out
6592648 understates its enormity the change in the social landscape is altering institutions that have been stable for generations and making possible new kinds of human engagement that have never existed before the results could be a marvel or a catastrophe depending on how seriously we try to shape whats possible
6592649 golden age of social software greatly extending the ability of groups to self organize
6592650 pluto is an odd shaped rock with an odd shaped orbit at the edge of the solar system
6592651 okay were going to have a conversation about authority or social construction or whatever
6592652 no one who works in tv gets to ask that question you know where the time comes from it comes from the cognitive surplus youve been masking for 50 years
6592653 dont go there that street corner is dangerous dont go in this neighborhood be careful there after dark
6592654 this information may or may not exist some place in society but its actually easier for me to try to rebuild it from scratch than to try and get it from the authorities who might have it now

6592683 the metaphysics of time continues to intrigue writers inside and outside the genre
6592684 im not sure im not sure im trying to get treatment this week and im feeling better every day
6592685 its going to end up being up to coach bill belichick and what he wants to do but i think hes been coaching long enough to understand that the first game in september is whats going to be important for us
6592686 we are very used to succeeding on a significant level and its disappointing when we dont or cant
6592687 it increases our determination that were deadly serious about what were doing elevating emergency medicine at this part of the country
6592688 itll decrease the amount of time theyre here decrease the amount of time it takes to get diagnosed and treated
6592689 the patients families are very important in the healing process they need to be with the patient there are times we need to have privacy examining a patient but the family can help get them better
6592690 the money comes from operations from being able to provide services in a cost effective manner and community support
6592691 the impression that i have from some of these tips these are acquaintances someone heard or loosely knows these people and for whatever reason for their conscience or the desire to be rewarded money they give us a call
6592692 if someone calls in with a tip on any crime they receive an informant number they dont take any names or anything like that phone numbers or nothing if the tip does lead to an arrest than the informant can be nominated for a reward
6592693 blacklists are a 1980s approach to a modern day problem
6592694 if michael phelps and i both were in our primes i think we would tie
6592695 hes very excited and just looking forward to getting up there and joining his team mates and pitching on saturday
6592696 hes worked extremely hard to put himself in this position and to be able to come back and compete at the highest level this season
6592697 injuries are a part of the game and every athlete at some time has to deal with the prospect of getting hurt
6592698 i dont think theres anything that he needs to redeem himself for at all
6592699 he was just basically a player who was unfortunate and got hurt now hes healthy and i think hes looking to get back up there and give the yankees everything that he has
6592700 its a very important control mechanism we want this certified ready and fully functional before we put the patients into the area
6592701 there was one non negotiable that we put on the table from day one we would never put a patient at risk and we would never put a career at risk
6592702 a hora essa se o professor optar por mim eu vou estar pronto para fazer a estr ia com certeza espero jogar bem junto com os companheiros e ir em busca dos tr s pontos que s o que nos interessa
6592703 o trabalho que vai nos fazer reverter essa situa o a gente tem que ver o que est errando para buscar as vit rias pelo que eu vi ontem n o faltou disposi o aos companheiros que estiveram em campo o que contou foram os detalhes que n s erramos
6592704 vai dar moral pra gente um jogo dif cil mas vamos estar dentro de casa temos que correr o dobro em busca dos tr s pontos
6592705 temos que tomar cuidado para n o entrar tanto em impedimento jogamos muito perto dos zagueiros e isso em alguns momentos facilita a vida deles na hora de fazer a linha do impedimento
6592706 estamos criando muito e talvez por isso tenhamos esse n mero t o grande de impedimentos temos feito o melhor para fazer os gols no sport e s vezes essa ansiedade tem nos atrapalhado
6592707 temos que conversar mais dentro de campo est faltando um pouco de comunica o na hora do passe final acho que se conversarmos mais tudo vai melhorar
6592708 it is an honor and a privilege for you to cover the new york jets
6592709 but you have an obligation to hold up your end of the bargain by being objective and fair in what you report yet you didnt do that
6592710 the result largely due to mike nugents missed 23 yard fg attempt to tie the game as time expired it hit the left upright along with a 43 yard miss earlier was the only disappointment for the jets but it hardly mattered this was all about favres debut and he didnt disappoint
6592711 it helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6592712 i try to keep all quarterbacks who are behind me healthy
6592713 obviously you want to keep that guy healthy as well
6592714 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6592715 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6592716 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6592717 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6592718 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6592719 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6592720 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6592721 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6592722 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks
6592723 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed its a preseason game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
6592724 hes healthy playing well obviously getting the at bats that he needs
6592725 and he hasnt had any setbacks so with all those things being said if he does have another good night hell be playing right field tomorrow night
6592726 i havent seen him in a long time but basically baseball shape baseball ready
6592727 just kind of talk to him and see where he is also mentally
6592728 in order to ensure that any investigation of the allegations is fair and free from any question of interference or influence i am taking a leave of absence effective immediately for the duration of the investigation
6592729 i started out at bgsu majoring in design and only got interested in glass after taking an elective course the whole process of glassblowing just completely engages you and part of my job here is to be like glass in that way i want to help create a program that shows off the creative assets that we have as a community while also bringing in internationally known artists to our area to both teach and demonstrate their skills in the craft
6592730 jeff has experience that spans museum technical and academic settings
6592731 i am confident that he will be a great asset to the museum staff and students as well as a vital part of the future of the glass pavilion and our community
6592732 the glass art movement really got its start here in the early 1960s with artists such as dominic lubino and harvey littleton i can remember as a college student visiting the glass studies room we have here the museum really inspired my whole career
6592733 this area has such a strong tradition when it comes to glassmaking i just want to work with people to collaboratively build a strong program i see a lot of potential here for that
6592734 um prazer jogar ao lado do lisson n s dois fomos revelados aqui o que prova a qualidade das categorias de base
6592735 i believe this partnership at the very least will enhance our global status and lead to inclusion in numerous initiatives in the future with ipwr and other prestigious partners
6592736 no one could have speculated to see brett in any other uniform never mind the jets
6592737 he wanted to come back and play and im happy hes getting another chance hes a great player and an even greater guy to boot
6592738 it just goes to show you that this is just a business
6592739 we all know what brett favre does and can do i think were all going to go out there and try to have some fun and take care of some business
6592740 i hear that there are a lot of new no 4 jerseys being sold in the area and that hes the no 1 seller around hes going to get a welcome to new york real well
6592741 he was lights out last year and could have been the mvp of the league he was playing at the top of his game well hes coming to new york where they can easily love you and hate you at the same time hes got a lot of pressure on his shoulders
6592742 if i said i didnt pay attention what he was doing over the summer id be lying because that was the only thing you saw on tv
6592743 i only succeed because i have failed so many times
6592744 the medias job is to focus on how bad things are and make them worse
6592745 when you build beautiful things people take care of them and durability is a cornerstone of sustainability
6592746 i really admire devas strength of purpose in helping turn this titanic like building industry toward sustainability
6592747 in no small part due to devas efforts california pioneered legislation focusing upon building standards that increased energy efficiency in 1978 since then we have learned a lot and the codes have been upgraded three times but we are still a long way from truly having building codes and community planning that have sustainability as their cornerstone
6592748 adopt where we design locate build and retrofit buildings to achieve sustainability in our work and lifestyles
6592749 and it means we have replaced forests and farm plants that consume co2 the principal gas causing climate change with houses strip malls and offices that emit greenhouse gases
6592750 wonderful inventory of existing buildings and lots in city locations that offer a good work and living environment
6592751 it isnt a question any longer of whether you brand yourself as a green contractor or a quality contractor
6592752 the two are now merging into being the same thing
6592753 weve given you every test know to man except an autopsy would you like one of those too
6592754 this is a tremendous event which demonstrates the skill and determination of firefighters to deliver the best possible service to the public
6592755 the fact that they train in their own time and travel from all over the country to take part proves the dedication firefighters have to saving lives
6592756 our own team has in the past been world champions and i wish them all the best in this challenge
6592757 even in preseason you get back in a routine and back to familiar things one day youre in san diego the next day youre in oxnard then youre in denver and now youre in dallas now were
6592758 it helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6592759 with colorados working families struggling to make ends meet big oil companies are enjoying record profits
6592760 mccain wants to drill along our coastline which experts say wont produce oil until 2018
6592761 but hes repeatedly opposed incentives for proven renewable energies like wind and solar power mccain voted against requiring big oil to invest their windfall profits in clean energy and new jobs but he supports a 4 billion tax break for americas five richest oil companies thats not a path to energy independence
6592762 given our national economic train wreck its important that the voice of working class families continues to be heard loudly and clearly across this country what better time and place to launch this effort than at this historic democratic convention
6592763 you ruined my day i thought you were going to say she was the vice presidential nominee
6592764 oh look at the man with the ideas that are so different
6592765 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6592766 im having a tough time saying it but this could be a year of transition
6592767 still given the way this league is and because there are so many unknowns if we stay healthy were going to contend
6592768 et un petit noir ce sont des gros bosseurs tu connais lexpression
6592769 hey mercedes why the long face why you cryin theres no need just put on this coheed and fallout
6592770 despite the best efforts of the government and humanitarian community to respond to the crisis the needs of people continue to far outstrip the resources available to hand
6592771 the time when the land is full of new shoots but there is no food it happens because the last rains failed and few crops were planted
6592772 you must be the change you wish to see in the world

6592840 the overall survival detailed in the expanded fda approval of vidaza is extremely important for patients with higher risk mds a group with limited options and median survival of about 15 months with classical treatments
6592841 vidaza however is also effective across a broad range of mds subgroups including who classified aml patients the largest subgroup in our study
6592842 the clinical data from this randomized phase iii controlled study demonstrated that patients with higher risk mds treated with vidaza benefit from a significant survival advantage a critical measure of a drugs effectiveness

6592911 i showed interest i made little humming sounds that shows interest
6592912 no doctor pinning me down to the mattress and shoving your tongue down my throat shows interest making little humming sounds just shows youre musically inclined

6592931 the big problem is that sheep farmers are getting so little of what they sell lambs for back in the form of returns that help to pay the bills last year at this time we were hit with the foot and mouth crisis in surrey that saw farm gate prices drop by 26 per cent yet the retail price fell by only 3 per cent that hardly seems like fair play or justice
6592932 this whole sheep business is getting very serious theres no money in it here in ireland we have lost almost two million breeding ewes in recent years and there is no sign of that trend changing
6592933 consumers who pay the taxes to support the industry will not put up with this much longer however at the same time we must have a fair deal from the supermarkets and an independent monitor of prices

6592939 i havent said yes just that id think about it
6592940 no talking to him no talking to rose were going to sit nearby and have some chips so you can watch them dont make direct eye contact and most importantly dont stare understood
6592941 you grab a nearby table and ill get the chips
6592942 not staring reading the poster on the wall behind them
6592943 yeah that he is i wouldnt want to run into him in a dark alley
6592944 look at him hes bigger than me stronger than me and trust me when i say his temper is worse than mine since we think alike i cant outsmart him i might be able to out run him but beyond that
6592945 shes very pretty i can see why you fancied her
6592946 martha youre beautiful as well she happened to be my first comp friend after the
6592947 i was drowning and she threw me a life preserver i held on for dear life in the end i realized that life is still worth living as much as i care for her id have to say that the same thing would have occurred if it were someone else i needed someone
6592948 yes if you hadnt been rescued most likely id never have met you
6592949 thank you i really appreciate it seeing the pictures of your former selves is one thing but to actually have the idea sink in well it helps to see one in person
6592950 never thought of it from your perspective guess youre right are you ready to go
6592951 yep lets clean up the mess and head for the tardis
6592952 i dont suppose we could go see your 8th self
6592953 youve been staring at that readout for a quarter of an hour is something wrong
6592954 everythings fine well be on tarquinos in a few hours you should get some sleep
6592955 only youve seemed so tired these last few days and look maybe im just being a git but im a bit worried about you
6592956 to answer your question no i havent been sleeping well
6592957 you seem to have that effect on me you shouldnt but you do
6592958 you shouldnt make me tremble like this its all wrong i shouldnt i cant feel like this
6592959 its just oh doctor you really are alien arent you
6592960 cause im just a kid i am of legal age you know
6592961 this isnt normal for me somethings terribly wrong i could be seriously ill i may very well be losing my mind
6592962 if youre not well the last thing im going to do is leave you alone
6592963 i cant risk endangering you what if i become violent
6592964 i never thought to ask if timelords were if you could if you had
6592965 humans timelords kaleds trakenites trions do you have any idea how many species there are out there that are superficially at least nearly identical and how many others just have more or less compatible reproductive physiognomies thousands maybe hundreds of thousands there are scientists and philosophers on half a million worlds trying to figure out why that is
6592966 ive been too busy with other things may have to look into it now though
6592967 ive never felt anything like that you know not in 900 years
6592968 no no youre doing it backwards first you flatter me then you shag me
6592969 a species as long lived as mine doesnt survive if it reproduces willy nilly rose it overruns its ecology depletes its food supply overpopulates to critical mass and then succumbs to epidemics or famine or any number of extinction scenarios
6592970 except he wasnt not completely id been trying very hard not to notice how lovely you looked in that dress
6592971 i told myself i was just tired that what i was feeling was just affection magnified by exhaustion
6592972 grieving youve lost your whole world doctor family friends i assume you had some people do odd things when theyve lost someone things that arent like themselves at all
6592973 nothing its just a very human sort of logic rose extrapolating to the psychologies of other species isnt always of course
6592974 its not grief but it is related to loss yes that must be it
6592975 it never occurred to me how could i have missed it
6592976 rose dyou remember i told you that i would know if any other timelord had survived
6592977 because im a timelord i can feel the shape and movement of time and space
6592978 all timelords shared this gift and because we all had this same connection to time space we could also sense each other
6592979 like a psychic thing reading one anothers minds and such
6592980 more of a vague presence useless background noise most of us considered it
6592981 burned from the universe as though theyd never existed depending on your point of view they never did
6592982 its not called a time war for nothing when the timelords ceased to exist it happened everywhere at once and everywhen
6592983 i still dont see what any of this has to do with with us
6592984 that can mutate very rapidly under the right conditions not as a species i mean not over generations the way normal evolution does it but individually some earth amphibians for instance certain kinds of frogs can change sex in order to ensure reproduction
6592985 no i mean imagine this a species with a long lifespan and a low reproductive urge a good balance everything in order population replacement with no catastrophic overgrowth
6592986 yes now imagine that race is wiped out or nearly wiped out a single individual manages to survive
6592987 ill explain later the lone survivors genetic material recombines during the transdimentional death of its species and because it can feel that it restructures itself ever so slightly into a form that might just might be more likely to reproduce
6592988 im not going mad im not losing my mind im completely normal
6592989 its just that normal has been redefined and i hadnt realised it
6592990 ive changed rose my dna has rearranged itself given me a new instinctual programme
6592991 just a loop from the planet we just left the tardis became friends with him and wants to keep him as a pet
6592992 ah loops are telepathic they are chatting and playing in their minds its quite amusing actually they are playing fetch right now
6592993 if he is telepathic why cant he stop making this bloody sound
6592994 its not really there he sends out brainwaves to communicate and since you arent telepathic they are bouncing off of you resulting in that sound dont worry about it you will get used to it
6592995 well i cant possible toss him out the tardis owns him and we are travelling in her after all
6592996 cant you tell moop to keep it down a little
6592997 come on we arent spending much time in here anyway he wont bother you too much
6592998 let me tell you moop is an highly intelligent creature what did you expect
6592999 well i certainly didnt think he would read a newspaper while while doing that and he looked at me like im of some inferior species or something
6593000 i would be veeery careful of what im saying now doctor
6593001 aww isnt he cute seriously rose i dont understand what you have against him if he is a little arrogant then only because he needs some time to settle in
6593002 what are you doing with that you said visit that looks more like staying
6593003 it is you can come back to get me when you realised the truth about him
6593004 are you sure you two didnt step out of line
6593005 even without knowing that it was still a pretty nasty thing to do what were you thinking
6593006 i know that you were happy about having another telepath here but you dont have to hurt rose like that because of him

6593037 a presidents faith or lack thereof undoubtedly shapes the way he governs
6593038 thats been true since george washingtons day its certainly true now when george w bush named jesus christ as his favorite political philosopher at a republican debate in 1999 that told voters a lot about the man and his world view for better or for worse barack obamas remark to rick warren that deciding when an unborn child should have human rights was above his pay grade is similarly revealing
6593039 symbolically the first presidential debate of 2008 left secular americans out of the conversation
6593040 our politicians will never stop speaking and even pandering to the faithful but they shouldnt leave the rest of us out in the cold

6593044 i think it is a combination of factors people are trying to make up for lost time stuck in traffic by trying to do things on the run like eating and putting on make up
6593045 people get blas about these things but one moments lack of concentration could mean the end of your life or someone elses

6593047 her mother handed her to us and the woman stayed behind there were too few firefighters at the beginning
6593048 the girl was totally disoriented she did not complain or talk despite the great number of serious injuries which she had
6593049 this fireman has become perhaps without intending to the hero of the day
6593050 kept asking me if it was true what was happening
6593051 he thought it was a film and he kept asking where was his father and when the film would end

6593070 the only way theyre going to turn the ship around is bringing to market compelling products that are competitively priced
6593071 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6593072 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine

6593082 while there is understandable caution among retailers the world over we remain confident that our multi brand multi region business model will deliver healthy growth and our forward orders support this view
6593083 however based on existing market conditions and assuming current exchange rates in particular an aud usd exchange rate of approximately us88 cents and an aud euro exchange rate of approximately 59 cents the group expects to deliver full year eps growth in the range of 8 per cent to 12 per cent in the 2008 09 financial year
6593084 a very pleasing result in any climate let alone in the prevailing economic conditions
6593085 this again demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the heightened global demand for the groups brands
6593086 while we have been affected by the increased frequency of natural perils widening credit spreads and soft cycles in key markets we have acknowledged we need to do better
6593087 we are confident these measures will underpin improved future profitability

6593096 he sees mexico as a country that is against the bolivarian project
6593097 they are fighting and dying while at home they are talking about slashing and cutting
6593098 far too big a mismatch between our aspirations and what we actually deliver
6593099 it seems the taliban the insurgency are prepared to carry out more frontal kinds of operations
6593100 the military alone has always been insufficient to counter an insurgency which remains essentially a political activity
6593101 a military coalition is a cumbersome weapon to use in a transnational counter insurgency campaign and rudderless without a unified political coalition
6593102 having a very liberated sexuality does not prevent you from falling into the awful trap of jealousy and does not protect you from the pain which accompanies it
6593103 the care and the rigour with which they described to me their sexuality showed that in a certain way they wanted to be like me
6593104 i think that any attempt to bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure
6593105 this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar

6593110 the poem was originally written about me when i was a kid i went out in a halloween costume one year dressed as a tiger and i came back in and put on white gloves cause i didnt think that the costume was enough and i wanted to do something else with it and after my mother got up off the floor from laughing she wrote a poem about it and several years later i wrote a musical based around the poem

6593161 those two bright lights of the world st dominic and st francis were together in rome once with the lord of ostia who later became the supreme pontiff and after they had spoken affectionate words in turn about the lord the bishop finally said to them in the primitive church the pastors of the church were poor and were men of charity not men of greed why he said do we not in the future make bishops and prelates from among your brothers who excel all others in the learning and example a dispute followed between the saints to which one should answer they both strove not to anticipate each other but to give way to each other what is more each was urging the other to make the reply each one gave preference to the other for each one was devoted to the other but in the end humility conquered francis lest he put himself forward and humility conquered dominic so that he would humbly obey and answer first therefore replying the blessed dominic said to the bishop lord my brothers have been raised to a high station if they only knew it and even if they wanted it to i could not permit them to acquire any other dignity after he had replied thus briefly the blessed francis bowed before the bishop and said lord my brothers are called minors so they will not presume to become greater their vocation teaches them to remain in a lowly station and to follow the footsteps of the humble christ so that in the end they may be exalted above the rest in the sight of the saints if he said you want them to bear fruit for the church of god hold and preserve them in the in the station to which they have been called and bring them back to lowly station even if they are unwilling i pray you therefore father that you by no means permit them to rise to any prelacy lest they become prouder rather than poorer and grow arrogant towards the rest such were the answers of these blessed men what then do you say o sons of the saints jealousy and envy prove you are degenerate and no less ambition proves you are illegitimate sons you bite and devour one another and your conflicts and strifes arise only from your concupiscences your wrestling is against the hosts of darkness your battle is against the armies of devils and you turn the points of your swords against each other your fathers filled with wisdom and their faces being turned towards the propitiatory looked familiarly upon one another while their sons filled with envy are grievous even to behold what will the body accomplish if it has a divided heart certainly the teaching of piety would progress more fruitfully throughout the world if the bond of charity joined the ministers of the word of god together more firmly for what we speak or what we teach is rendered greatly suspect because a certain leaven of hatred is made evident in us today by evident signs i know that the good on either side are not at fault but the bad who i think should be rooted out lest they infect the holy what then shall i say then of those who set their minds on high things the fathers came to the kingdom by way of humility not by the way of loftiness the sons walking about in the circle of their ambition do not ask the way of a city for their habitation what is left that we who do not follow their way should not attain glory far be it from us lord make their disciples humble under the wings of their humble master make kindred spirits kind and mayst thou see thy childrens children peace upon israel when the answers of the servants of god had been given as what narrated above the lord of ostia was much edified by the words of both and gave great thanks to god but as they left the blessed dominic asked st francis to kindly give him the cord he wore about his waist st francis was reluctant to do this moved by the same humility to refuse as the other was moved to ask finally however the blessed devotion of the petitioner won out and dominic very devoutly put the cord that was given him about himself beneath his inner tunic then the two joined hands and commended themselves to one another with great kindliness the one said to the other blessed francis i wish that your order and mine might be made one and that we might live in the church according to the same rule

6593166 as a result of a veterinary assessment staff from both taronga zoo and seaworld say the whales condition has rapidly deteriorated
6593167 its condition is such that they cannot be sure that it would survive until the morning
6593168 the recommendation they made to us which weve accepted is that they humanely euthanize the whale tonight provided they can find it
6593169 weve conveyed this to the rspca and theyve agreed with our assessment
6593170 thats exactly what whales will do when theyre curious about something
6593171 the calf is physically not big enough to make really strong sounds
6593172 the only good solution would be if the mother starts a wider search pattern and reconnects with this calf or if another female just happened to be in the area and had lost its calf

6593179 more information has come to light that did point to discrepancies
6593180 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further with the national chinese federation if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into as to why there is a discrepancy
6593181 these documents existed on a state wide website and now they dont exist and this change has taken place recently i was interested because these were documents that no one could find if theres information to be found on the internet im a citizen journalist it was a challenge
6593182 the listing in there quite clearly is he kexins birth date january 1 1994
6593183 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
6593184 much of the coverage regarding kexins age has only mentioned allegations of fraud and the ioc has ignored the matter completely i believe that these primary documents issued by the chinese state rise to a level of evidence higher than allegation how official are these documents pretty dang official they were issued by the general administration of sport of china

6593190 today we held further discussions with pentagon officials about the timeline for the air force kc x tanker replacement bid
6593191 the rfp evaluation changes will have a ripple effect throughout the proposal submitted by boeing the pentagon should allow an additional four months for the competitors to properly respond to the changes
6593192 these new replacement tankers will be in use for 40 years and it is dramatically unfair to rig the competition by being unwilling to allow an additional four months for a response to the dynamic changes in the rfp
6593193 we have witnessed the air forces lavish willingness to accommodate the team proposing a french aircraft and it is our belief congress will insist on a fair process that allows the boeing team adequate time to respond to the shift in the dods evaluation criteria
6593194 failure to proceed with a fair competition will be met with fierce bipartisan resistance in congress
6593195 in a bi partisan letter sent last week we asked defense secretary robert gates to allow more time for the revised rfp to be understood by the bidders

6593201 each year is different and has its own set of challenges i probably feel more relaxed now than i have at any time whether the writings on the wall i dont know but i know what my job is certainly losing is uncomfortable ive always said that it never felt good
6593202 its going to be there regardless i put enough pressure on myself and my expectations have always been extremely high and certainly critical of my own coaching mistakes our players know that we all make them i need to coach better and get the most out of our players and thats always the challenge of a coach were working hard at that
6593203 our players have done so many good things i like our kids and what theyve been able to accomplish in a tough environment a tough league and tough circumstances when we took over we were bowl eligible one year and missed out on a bowl by not beating arizona state by three points
6593204 we just have to learn from our mistakes and learn from our shortcomings and get better if we do that then well have a chance to do some really exciting things this season were the only ones who can control anything we do
6593205 the perception is how we play and all we can do is try to prepare and work hard and have a good attitude in what we do weve always said the wins will come if we do all those things our leadership as a program and as a team has to continue to improve and those are hard things when you havent won and havent had success those are your biggest challenges when you lose you usually have certain habits that arent very good and that takes time to change old habits into good habits but were close
6593206 the competition has a cumulative effect on you throughout the course of any season
6593207 were knocking on the door if you keep giving yourself opportunities and if youre doing the right things youre eventually going to knock the door down you look at the past two years weve had too many close scores too many games where we played too well for too long weve come up short in some games and some losses you kinda shake your head at our toughness has to continue to improve mentally we have to become stronger and i think leadership is critical whether its mine or the leaders on the team
6593208 when you have a team that hasnt had a great deal of success it lacks confidence in some areas
6593209 you have to take it i tell or players theres nothing we can do until we win my message is were going to work hard and prepare hard and play hard when it happens it will happen until then its a humbling game
6593210 we have seven home games to play five road games in this conference is never easy thats what we had to do last year we played at cal oregon state usc and asu along with going to byu which hadnt lost in three years at home
6593211 thats where i think you lose some of your momentum when you dont win games that you have every opportunity to win and we cant let that happen again we made too many mistakes to win the new mexico game sometimes those losses will set you back a little bit and i think the new mexico game set us back a little bit it took us awhile to regroup
6593212 maintaining harrisburgs infrastructure is essential for the success of the city and its residents i know that a lot of hard work and local leadership is needed for each and every one of the projects we have seen on our tour today
6593213 city leaders have ambitious plans to advance infrastructure and keep growth on track i look forward to continuing my work at the federal level to help mayor ramstad and local leaders continue to pursue plans to improve the community
6593214 everyone knows that rule number one for any job is showing up no private company would put up with its employees refusing to show up for work let alone watch the problem grow year after year these findings are an insult to the american taxpayer and should be of great concern to the agencies included and members of congress
6593215 it is inexcusable that federal agencies would sit by and let this problem get worse while some agencies are completely unaware that there even is a problem before agencies come hat in hand to congress asking for money to hire more employees they should fully use the ones they already have by getting the awol problem under control awol employees put a hidden tax on the american taxpayer by making the federal government more inefficient with the resources it has been given
6593216 the police have detained people who sought permission to protest
6593217 to an extrajudicial term of re education through labor this week for applying to hold a legal protest in a designated area in beijing
6593218 arrested five americans on tuesday after they spelled out free tibet with blue l e d lights near the national stadium
6593219 adopting a compressed workweek would take approximately 20 percent of federal employees off the roads on any given weekday generating significant cost savings for the american taxpayer without a drop in productivity or decrease in service
6593220 i talked with federal emergency management administrator r david paulison this afternoon wednesday to push the case for expanded assistance for new hampshire
6593221 its clear that a number of communities in these counties suffered significant damage from the july 24th tornado and storms and i am pleased that merrimack and strafford counties will be receiving assistance
6593222 hey i tried to find your box but couldnt find it i went here and here but got stuck here was i anywhere close
6593223 i think the earth movers are clearing the park where i think you box is and couldnt find it just wanted to let you know
6593224 i looked for 20 minutes got to a dead end where a dead end shouldnt have been and you need to move your box or retire it
6593225 but the murtha operation which has become a model for other entrepreneurial lawmakers is a gross example of quid pro quo washington
6593226 love competition love risking your pride love winning it back love giving it everything youve got love the glory love the pain love sport even when it breaks your heart
6593227 we are about sticking by athletes through thick and thin
6593228 through injury and poor performances that is why sports are such an exciting field there are no guarantees there is heartbreak and failure as well as excitement and triumph
6593229 we have immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour
6593230 we want to act to protect our brand reputation in the same way as any corporation would want to if people were posting or writing false accusations
6593231 this isnt about a debate on freedom of speech its simply helping us to identify the person who posted it
6593232 i think wayne rooney gerrard and the other players that are not in a perfect condition physically will be very important
6593233 the movement of rooney and the work that he does every game is very important
6593234 played not only because he can take set pieces and free kicks but because he plays well that is why for me he is in the team beckham terry ferdinand are all the same if they dont play well they will not play
6593235 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best
6593236 there had been faith that capello would get far more out of these footballers
6593237 we are moving in the right direction theres no doubt but there is more to do across the board we have a number of sports that do everything they can and they broadly reflect the medal haul from beijing
6593238 ihr braucht nich nach hause fahrn ihr braucht nich nach hause fahrn
6593239 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
6593240 the attitude of the great coordinations of the international communist movement towards nepali revolution
6593241 the existing coordinations and aggregations of the international communist movement do not yet express themselves on the meaning of nepali revolution
6593242 none of the various aggregations of communist parties and organizations can set itself even as an embryo of a new international if it does not overcome this difficulty if it just restricts itself to denounce revisionism and imperialism if it does not propose a course that could lead communists to victory in the imperialist and the semi colonial and oppressed countries according to the specific conditions of the ones and the others such proposals do not rise from some individual genius nor from the particular qualities of a single party or organization
6593243 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
6593244 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury
6593245 took place so long ago that there is no likely reason their disclosure would cause competitive disadvantage
6593246 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6593247 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6593248 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest
6593249 this very much the man in every sense of the word
6593250 and this literally fabulous in every sense of the word
6593251 every time i see the medal table i think bloody hell so this is what it must feel like to be an australian
6593252 oooh and shes gone down like a real box of tricks
6593253 but clearly there are a lot of positives she can take forward from that because she is only 32 and with her year on year improvement of 0 05 seconds by the time we get to 2016 she should have a very real chance of threatening to break into the top eight
6593254 its about hundredths of a second its about the tiny details
6593255 a freak in the most positive sense of that word

6593257 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6593258 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6593259 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6593260 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6593261 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6593262 so called friends wont accept me i just dont seem to fit in around here no more
6593263 when you ask in a strange town they say dont know dont care and i gotta go mate

6593265 come on little stranger theres only one last dance soon the musics over lets give it one more chance
6593266 i love this accidental collective of ladybloggers i think its a wonderful notion to have a bunch of creative women who inspire each other and other ladies positivity on the internet is a powerful thing and i am all about girl power
6593267 amar a un ser humano es brindarle la oportunidad de ser escuchado con profunda atenci n inter s y respeto aceptar su experiencia sin pretender odificarla sino comprenderla ofrecerle un espacio en el que pueda descubrirse sin miedo a ser calificado en el que sienta la confianza de abrirse sin ser forzado a revelar aquello que considera privado es reconocer y mostrar que tiene el derecho inalienable de elegir su propio camino aunque ste no coincida con el tuyo es permitirle descubrir su verdad interior por s mismo y a su manera apreciarlo sin condiciones sin juzgarlo ni reprobarlo sin pedirle que se amolde a tus ideales sin exigirle que act e de acuerdo con tus expectativas es valorarlo por ser quien es no por ser como tu desear as que fuera es confiar en su capacidad de aprender de sus errores y de levantarse de sus ca das m s fuerte y m s maduro y comunicarle tu fe y confianza en su poder como ser humano

6593272 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6593273 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6593274 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6593275 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6593276 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6593277 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6593278 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6593279 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6593280 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6593281 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6593282 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6593283 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6593284 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6593285 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6593286 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6593287 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

6593292 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6593293 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6593294 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6593295 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6593296 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6593297 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6593298 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6593299 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6593300 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6593301 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6593302 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6593303 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6593304 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6593305 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6593306 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6593307 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6593308 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6593309 who are open to doing something on the production side
6593310 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6593311 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6593312 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

6593318 i strongly believe that eddie lewis will be an outstanding addition to the galaxy
6593319 he brings great experience to the club and will be a wonderful addition to our locker room and is a player that the fans are sure to support
6593320 unfortunately the sport of soccer is also a business and in order to bring eddie to the galaxy we were required to make salary budget space available and our only available option was to move carlos
6593321 alright i give up this man is too good the muslims can stay
6593322 first i held up three fingers to represent trinity and he raised a finger to remind me that there is still one common god in both religions
6593323 well first he said that we muslims had three days to leave jerusalem so i said fuck you then he said that the whole jerusalem should be cleared from muslims i told him that none of us would leave
6593324 then he pulled out his lunch i pulled out mine

6593329 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6593330 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6593331 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6593332 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone
6593333 we have only one single minded goal in this effort
6593334 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6593335 if water had been available it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today
6593336 it looks like they want to wrap up this investigation and blame the collapse on normal office fires
6593337 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6593338 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6593339 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6593340 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6593341 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6593342 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6593343 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6593344 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6593345 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6593346 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6593347 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6593348 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6593349 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6593350 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6593351 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6593352 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6593353 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6593354 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6593355 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6593356 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6593357 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6593358 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6593359 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6593360 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6593361 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6593362 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6593363 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6593364 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6593365 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6593366 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6593367 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6593368 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6593369 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6593372 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6593373 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6593374 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6593375 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6593376 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6593377 he gives these big sermons that everyone praises but sounds like a boyfriend who doesnt really know much about cars ya know
6593378 if he was my boyfriend dont worry michelle hes not id need to tape his mouth shut so he wouldnt be trying so hard to talk about things he doesnt really know ya know
6593379 laura has a nice buff bod and shes really not as snooty smart as i would have guessed being an ivory league soap girl and all that ya know
6593380 the illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn unlearn and relearn
6593381 this case suggests that facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily reintegrate themselves back into society
6593382 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement
6593383 when one person asks another for help often the person being asked says that he will try
6593384 i cannot give you the entire sum that you need
6593385 please give the full sum if you cannot at least agree to try to procure the remainder from another source
6593386 but all i ask is that you try why refuse such a small request
6593387 do you know the meaning of saying i will try in gittin 30 we find the case of one who gave his wife a and said this divorce will take effect if i do not appease you within thirty days rav yosef explains that even if he tried to appease her but she was not amenable the takes effect surely if he had given her a chest full of coins or made other great efforts she would have been appeased we see that chazal understood making an effort to mean something very different than what most people intend today today people believe that this is just an expression without true meaning but this is inaccurate in light of this how can you ask me to make an effort who can say he has fulfilled his obligation to try
6593388 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

6593391 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6593392 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6593393 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6593434 harry potter and the half blood prince to summer 2009
6593435 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6593436 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6593437 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6593438 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6593439 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6593440 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6593441 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6593442 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6593443 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6593444 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6593445 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6593446 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights

6593469 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured

6593477 do not underestimate the wit or endurance of your opponent
6593478 but in a strange way it kind of forced everybody to look at the show differently which you dont often have an opportunity like that after seven seasons so it allowed the writers to walk in kind of with a blank slate in some ways and look at how to really reinvent and reinvigorate the show the characters the situations and the relationships so were actually all very energized i havent seen the writers room this energized in a little while not that they werent really passionate before but i think its just forced everyone to dig deep
6593479 i think the way we approach it is nobody could ever step into michael rosenbaum and lex luthors shoes
6593480 so i think that was the first thing when we sat down to really think about the season about the villains and who clark was eventually going to be fighting that was our number one thing dont try to replace lex luthor theres just no point to it we cant do it and we would never want to we honor the character we honor the actor so much but that said we looked around at who was going to be the biggest villain we could possibly bring in
6593481 what smallville always tries to do whenever they reinvent something is also try to link up eventually with what happens in the traditional mythology
6593482 you get the sense that is where the characters going so that everything kind of matches up just because he comes onto the scene as like this really great fun loving charming paramedic doesnt mean we arent also trying to figure out how to make sure that he lines up down the road
6593483 well the great thing for the four of us is that since weve been on the show as long as we have these characters it sounds kind of clich but the characters and the world and the show have a life of its own
6593484 so you cant ever come in and change some things you cant come in and do a ninety degree turn even if thats your intent because the characters are so true to themselves i think our cast does such an amazing job of embodying the characters that they really live as real people so when we talk about all the changes its probably more of an evolution than change
6593485 across the board for all characters its time to move on to the next phase of their life
6593486 which is kind of exciting so theres a lot of some sense of leaving the past behind and moving to the next part of the superman mythology
6593487 i think allison has just been such a great chloe
6593488 and will always be that chloe this year its just about opening up her world a little bit more same thing with clark kent i think that the show has been successful based on its ability to kind of give us an origin story of superman that felt real but also had some reinterpretations in it we are just following in those footsteps that al and miles created for us so clark kent is still the same clark kent we just want to get him closer to the superman that we know that the general public is more familiar with
6593489 the only thing that we are saying is that we can absolutely confirm that there is no tights so thats pretty much all we can say on that
6593490 saving people in smallville was one thing when he had to run to the factory to save chloe the roads werent very crowded the streets werent very crowded being alive in metropolis as superman is a very different experience and you will find very quickly in this season he discovers its not so easy when youre running through crowded streets or your having to run into a crowded crisis situation
6593491 or youre accountable to lois back at the daily planet
6593492 so thats what forces him to start really exploring the two worlds
6593493 the dynamic of clark and lois at the daily planet when the dailies are coming in is fantastic
6593494 it is iconic it is exactly what those two actors feel like they were meant to do i mean they are just great together and watching clark and lois together in the way that were used to seeing them from everything that we remember i think is making a really fun show this year
6593495 what is great is that she is really present in all the episodes so far shes just front and center and is doing a great job so yes there is an opportunity for more
6593496 we definitely have an episode this year that addresses a lot of the underlying tension the sexual tension and the love tension between the two of them

6593645 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6593646 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6593647 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6593648 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this

6593684 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6593685 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6593686 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment

6593730 then after i began to get good sleep through treatment for my sleep apnea i was just truly amazed that within a couple of months my good memory returned
6593731 people not only have the ability to improve their memory by taking a short hap but also the ability to integrate their thoughts
6593732 when our body and our mind are telling us that we need a nap this is a physiological response to what we require in fact to be able to be more productive and more functional

6593734 usually in people taking moderate doses of the drug you see some sort of mild acne but in severe cases it can ulcerate
6593735 the doses this man was taking were within the doses that are used among bodybuilders
6593736 there is probably a dose effect with the steroids but its also dependent on how the individual reacts
6593737 it is questionable whether he will be able to start building muscle mass again he may not be able to perform the exercises due to the scarring
6593738 its well documented that some individuals can experience severe acne
6593739 often this is just a transient problem most people wouldnt consider it a significant barrier to using anabolic steroids
6593740 people who snore run an increased risk of early death and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks or strokes
6593741 snoring is more than just a nuisance and can be a sign of a respiratory condition called sleep apnoea which affects more than 110 000 people in the uk and is caused by the narrowing of the throat during sleep

6593760 this case suggests that facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily reintegrate themselves back into society
6593761 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or one day
6593762 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging

6593764 the worst dining experience of my career as a food writer
6593765 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6593766 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6593767 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops
6593768 to halt military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions

6593770 it is my hometown and when this thing happened i felt so bad yesterday and today
6593771 its good because i won the match without playing my best level
6593772 i dont think i could have asked for a better week before the u s open
6593773 in the second set i just fought one point at a time everything was going my way
6593774 she doesnt give you any points especially on hardcourts she just played better than me today
6593775 it was too hot in the beginning of the second set i felt a little dizzy but then i was fighting until the end thats why i won
6593776 ontario much more than canada has more stagflation it has the weakest growth and among the highest inflation rates
6593777 the economics of ontario continue to look bad for quite some time
6593778 alberta faced its big price run ups a year or two ago and now were seeing some levelling off
6593779 the hyper optimism has gone and theres certainly a change in the marketplace since the boom
6593780 but the market is more balanced now it has a quiet strength to it and theres still great opportunities here
6593781 every putt i had it just fell in the hole
6593782 every time i held my putter i could feel that it was going to go in
6593783 im real disappointed after having come back to fight so hard and to not have it be good enough to win it hurts
6593784 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6593785 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6593786 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6593787 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6593788 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6593789 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6593790 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6593791 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that
6593792 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play
6593793 when he gets hot he does do some crazy stuff
6593794 if you drive the ball well you have some birdie chances and if you dont you struggle to break par
6593795 so you want to be a rock amp roll star
6593796 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6593797 a partner with me in strengthening this economy for the middle class and working families
6593798 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house

6593800 having a very liberated sexuality does not prevent you from falling into the awful trap of jealousy and does not protect you from the pain which accompanies it
6593801 the care and the rigour with which they described to me their sexuality showed that in a certain way they wanted to be like me
6593802 we have been doing a lot of original reporting and we are going to be doing a lot more
6593803 we get these interviews because we have this global audience of 500 million viewers
6593804 our aim is to reach these bigger names and use our reporting talent to break news we are really going for the kinds of questions that will make news
6593805 we really are paying a lot of attention to what our audience wants
6593806 we see tremendous traffic on politics what is going on around the world and the names that get their interest
6593807 we like to pick people with expertise in the subject matter
6593808 aarons father fought in the korean war and he has tons of experience in reporting
6593809 we are really going for places we feel we can have an impact and cover them in ways that are slightly different
6593810 we want to be the number one independent news source on the internet
6593811 it is probably better to talk about insurgencies than an insurgency
6593812 some of these groups are just six guys and they hate the six guys from the next village
6593813 it is very organised you send someone to quetta the western pakistan city to find out what is needed you agree a price you attack the convoy or police station or blow up the bridge or whatever they send someone to verify the damage and then they pay you
6593814 they all have a common interest in disorder said christina oguz kabul representative of the united nations office for drugs and crime often the taliban levy on opium the traditional 10 tax on agricultural products in the east the link with narcotics is more tenuous

6593819 i find it ironic that in order to out hip apple microsoft is hiring a comedian whose prime was a decade ago they may as well have phil collins do the background music while theyre at it
6593820 i think seinfeld was credible in the american express ads he used to do but microsoft needs him to be twice as good at comedy and many more times effective at drawing the audience into the message of the commercials if they want to best apple
6593821 gates is certainly a very recognizable figure but hes never been someone i viewed in the position of a humorous or edgy pitchman for microsoft
6593822 whenever ive seen him speak about microsoft and its products it has always been a much more logical intellectual presentation and im wondering how that fits in this new series
6593823 if the entertainment value of their ads isnt exceptional theyll look like a cornered cat lashing aimlessly in desperation
6593824 the big concern i have right now is our ability to provide updates
6593825 on the pc side weve done as many as four updates in a day and thats great we can respond very quickly
6593826 how and when is still sort of being determined on pricing and that kind of stuff
6593827 on the pc its sort of wide open you can release stuff whenever you want on the console theres a little bit more of a pathway
6593828 he was admitted we left him at 10 at night he was dead stiff rigid and unresponsive at 7 15 in the morning
6593829 he was cold rigid stiff liver mortis and rigor mortis at 7 15 in the morning that means several hours went by
6593830 i had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question
6593831 first time i parked my bike over there and i locked my bike and i went in the library for three or four hours
6593832 bust my lock it was still here my helmet was still here but my bike was gone
6593833 i recall watching him walk around the building looking for his bike in tears
6593834 i felt like i was the only one out there and everyone was against me its a lonely feeling
6593835 instead it was a beautiful schwinn it looked brand new
6593836 i felt the guys pain when i watched him walking around looking for that bike i felt really bad for him

6593842 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6593843 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6593844 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6593845 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6593846 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6593847 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6593848 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6593849 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6593850 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6593851 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6593852 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6593853 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6593854 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6593855 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question

6593857 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6593858 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

6593864 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6593865 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6593866 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

6593869 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6593870 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6593871 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6593873 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6593874 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

6593897 kwan yin brings to us a true self nurturing these retreats always begin with the self because how can you give to others if you are incapable of giving to yourself if youre completely depleted stressed out exhausted and not taking care of yourself then how can you possibly benefit anyone else
6593898 the popular theory of the indians is that they are vermin and that the only policy to be seriously advocated is extermination yet a very little knowledge of the facts will show that they are peculiarly exposed to cruel oppression and extortion of every kind their very forlornness invites knavery and as when pushed to extremity they are sure to take some sudden and terrible revenge their enemy persecutes them with impunity
6593899 no amount of reason no statement of facts will ever change the opinion of either the eastern or western people on this subject
6593900 massacre by soldiers after quietly giving up their arms but that a few escaped and that the loss among the soldiers was caused by themselves shooting into each other
6593901 five years i attended while some might see this as twisted lakota logic what happened next proved that american logic was even more twisted when it came to and the lakota nation
6593902 i was in command of that department in 1889 1890 and 1891 when what is known as the messiah craze
6593903 the medicine man taken at the battle of wounded knee
6593904 the medal of honor is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the armed services of the in the name of congress it is often called the congressional medal of honor it soon became clear that there were those who were believed to have gone above and beyond this call and on the chairman of the senate naval committee senator james w grimes introduced a bill to promote the efficiency of the navy navy secretary gideon wells was looking for a way to inspire sailors to improve their work this bill was approved by president abraham lincoln which provided for the preparation of 200 medals of honor to be awarded upon such petty officers seamen landsmen and marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action and other seamen like qualities during the present war thus the medal of honor was created
6593905 killing an indian who was in the act of killing a wounded man of b troop
6593906 taking the place of his commanding officer who had fallen severely wounded he gallantly served his place after each fire advancing it to a better position
6593907 this ravine was adjacent to the lakotas camp and many noncombatants sought shelter there
6593908 the reason of the indian outbreak general miles declares that the indians are starved into rebellion
6593909 actual conflict with an enemy distinguished by conspicuous gallantry or intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty
6593910 neither a medal of honor nor a certificate of merit will be awarded in any case when the service of the person recommended subsequent to the time when he distinguished himself has not been honorable
6593911 the only precedence for striking names from the medal of honor roll occurred in a 1916 congressional act
6593912 are you amp ing kidding me horton hears a freakin who i dont believe this
6593913 this is really hard but i have to decline acceptance
6593914 kingston gwen and gavin rossdale welcomed the newest member of their family
6593915 only 13 thing but only a few years ago cassiopeias were crazy on
6593916 its really important to encourage the questions why are we doing this whats the point why do you go to this place what level of engagement do you want and what level of education are you prepared to embrace
6593917 i love my country but i think we should start seeing other people
6593918 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6593919 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6593920 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6593921 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6593922 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6593923 there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear for fear has torment and he that fears has not been made perfect in love

6593927 ultima publicaci n de la casa editorial el nayarit editorial
6593928 al principio si me desespere por que no prosperaba como yo quisiera y las deudas eran altas pues nos sabia cuantos libros producir ya que en realidad el pueblo nayarita no es muy consumidor de libros fue cuando me acerque al sepen y me dijeron que si me apoyaban pero con la condici n de que les cediera los derechos y pues no ah decid ser independiente
6593929 originalmente lo que hacia era que yo trabajaba en mi computadora y aventaba los tiros en mi impresora el encuadernador dise aba la portada con la fotograf a y el dise o que le indicaba y as se completaba el libro
6593930 hay creadores que se quejan de que no tienen apoyo no ser que lo que no tienen es talento o iniciativa podemos encontrar en el extranjero una gran cantidad de apoyos y becas a creadores que las buscan hay muchas opciones en materia de cultura adem s hay un fondo nacional para la cultura y las artes el estado termina en limites muy concretos pero los apoyos no yo si veo mucha dependencia veo creadores que no se les apoya y no hace nada eso es muy triste
6593931 por otro lado el estado es importante cuando crea un banda de viento en ruiz y la financia cuando crea una escuela de mariachi en jala y la financia o cuando sostiene una casa de cultura en tepic y ense a a ni os a pintar y a bailar el estado si tiene una funci n y en teor a deber a tener una pol tica cultural clara sin embargo la actividad cultural no depende de eso
6593932 es en este sentido y de forma tal que pro estatales e independientes tenemos que trabajar hacia un mismo rumbo con metas claras y preestablecidas
6593933 and we can use that to generate energy and free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil
6593934 here in nevada we should have solar panels all throughout the state everywhere
6593935 and then hes got the nerve to stand up there on television and talk about how he believes in alternative energy
6593936 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
6593937 i go to nature to be soothed and healed and to have my senses put in order
6593938 existence is the ideas that are immediately perceived outside myself there are still only ideas but in this case perceived by a greater omnipresent idea perceiver there is no reason to further invent the idea of material matter a useless induction that we can have no immediate experience of to confirm or otherwise anyway
6593939 no existence is the matter that is immediately perceived by material by means of material processes centred around the material of your brain this is the omnipresent substance outside of the self too and there is no reason to invent this further concept of ideas to unnecessarily complicate this simple observation
6593940 dont you see how youre both arguing the same point but just with different words to explain the seemingly unwilled novelties into the only mind you can have knowledge about why not simplify this speculation by putting all experience down to the mind of the self it is simpler to put it all down to your less vivid observations ie memories being so stubborn that they demand consistency to be acknowledged and novelty is merely the inability of this effort to keep existence constant and controlled
6593941 but you too are falling victim to a pointless speculation between how to characterise an origin of seemingly unintentional new experience now we have 3 different names for the same extra immediate consciousness cause god universe and memory why not simply erase the conflict of which one substance to accept with a nice synthesis the equal validity of the physical exterior and the mental interior
6593942 well at least we arent inventing an entirely new connective substance between two entirely opposite substances to further complicate an experientially evident single substance existence
6593943 why cant they realise that theyre all equally guilty of only getting out the assumptions they started off with in the first place
6593944 descartes put doubt into his methods to simplify everything and not surprisingly all he ended up with was doubt the natural scientist will demand there is something more to the object of experimentation and as such that is inevitably the further complication discovered in the results
6593945 home sales probably would be rising in the absence of the mortgage liquidity issues of the past two months
6593946 some buyers with contracts have been scrambling when loan commitments did not materialize at the last moment while other potential buyers are simply waiting for the mortgage market to stabilize
6593947 now it appears that it will be the first region to climb back indicating that other regions could follow a similar path
6593948 for buyers able to qualify for conventional financing there are ample opportunities in the current market
6593949 availability and pricing of conventional loans are reasonable and fha insured mortgage applications have been rising as low and moderate income buyers seek alternatives to subprime loans if buyers are in it for the long haul now can be a good time to get into your home
6593950 in unsettled times like these when world cultures countries and religions are facing off in violent confrontations we could benefit from the reminder that storytelling is common to all civilizations
6593951 everything beautiful has been ruined by critics and academics its not enough that something just is its got to mean something too
6593952 absolutely tore me to bits all i said was those people are no more native american than i am which is true of course you cant say things like that in rhode island so everybody went nuts the journal took their ususal self righteous stance the cannibals i lost all of my old business contacts even buddy wouldnt talk to me people are so uptight these days so goddam conservative and i say that to you as a fellow republican
6593953 oh then i say that to you as a fellow democrat
6593954 anyway here i am still dreaming still going strong even twelve years later you can hate me mr savage but you cant keep me down and you know why because i dont hate anyone i refuse to i hate fakery i hate falseness but i dont hate people

6593959 the attitude of the great coordinations of the international communist movement towards nepali revolution
6593960 the existing coordinations and aggregations of the international communist movement do not yet express themselves on the meaning of nepali revolution
6593961 none of the various aggregations of communist parties and organizations can set itself even as an embryo of a new international if it does not overcome this difficulty if it just restricts itself to denounce revisionism and imperialism if it does not propose a course that could lead communists to victory in the imperialist and the semi colonial and oppressed countries according to the specific conditions of the ones and the others such proposals do not rise from some individual genius nor from the particular qualities of a single party or organization
6593962 standing looking towards the path i am to take i tremble

6593981 when i close the door behind me you will wake putting aside your memories of these events until the appointed time when you will be allowed to remember you will clean up the mess on your legs and on the floor and leave as if nothing had happened you will not concern yourself with the missing time or why your legs are sticky cum if you will obey

6594003 si todos nos sentamos a dialogar enriqueceremos la ciudad y mejoraremos su calidad de vida por lo que agradeci a los grupos pol ticos a los t cnicos y a los colectivos que con sus alegaciones han ayudado a mejorar el documento
6594004 this type of harassment has been used against peaceful protestors in the past and never have these tyrannical methods been acceptable
6594005 the pro life community needs to stand up and demand media attention for these heinous abuses
6594006 american life league is committed to making sure these people get the attention they deserve
6594007 this kind of blatant disregard for pro lifers rights on the part of governor martin omalleys state police wont be tolerated if these pro lifers were pro abortion activists or peta protesters this would have been on the front page of every newspaper on the east coast
6594008 weve been promoting the region for some time and informing visitors of all the things to do in gulgong such as historical significance of the town and you can see how were growing though the promotional campaign

6594014 we love coming to the area the show is always fantastic and everyone really knows how to enjoy themselves
6594015 weve had some great concerts in this past but i really think this one is going to be one of the best
6594016 it has taken me the past two years to finish it and its hard to believe that with the rich history of the mudgee wine industry this is the first book of its type to be written
6594017 there is an enormous amount of research in the book which traces the industry back to its first days in the 1800s up to 2000
6594018 we owe a lot to the german immigrants who started producing wine in the 1950s
6594019 the discovery of chardonnay in the late 1960s at craigmoor vineyard was a springboard for the mudgee wine industry and the vineyard became the source block for much of the chardonnay produced around australia
6594020 we were the first region to promote wine outside australia and of course botobolar was the first organic vineyard
6594021 it is fitting that the release of the book coincides with the 150th anniversary of mudgee wine
6594022 by you our customers we have surveyed hundreds of professional candle makers and weve received valuable feedback as to what candle making equipment and supplies that a beginner candle maker needs in order to learn the basics of candle making and still remain within a realistic monetary budget

6594032 it does not like to rename any section of a highway so we may have to look at alternatives
6594033 mike was the last teacher at eurunderee school and later as a teacher at mudgee high school initiated a special education facility for children with a disability
6594034 through his work mudgee became the first school in the state to integrate children with a disability into the normal school program today there are many such successful units across nsw as a result of mikes efforts
6594035 having an entrance like this is a great asset for a town
6594036 it is a very worthy acknowledgement of mr rowlands contribution to the entire community

6594042 no nos hemos enterado en la segunda ce ida los alemanes ya nos han dejado de preocupar pues los dos primeros estaban bien colocados y ellos si quer an estar en disposici n de hacer algo deb an estar en esos puestos nos hemos olvidado de ellos y nos hemos concentrado en el australiano y sabiendo que los argentinos estaban detr s

6594055 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
6594056 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury

6594059 there are scores of oems original equipment manufacturers that have skin in the game
6594060 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case

6594114 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6594115 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6594116 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6594144 i preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism
6594145 its hard when you hear about it because it reminds you how fragile and precious your children are
6594146 my son has a diagnosis of moderate to severe autism and my daughter sadie has a diagnosis of mild to moderate autism
6594147 its very common for children and adults with disabilities to be abused and taken advantage of
6594148 learning that he was being investigated for a very serious crime
6594149 we could improve upon the qualifications of the individuals who are working with our children
6594150 i really hope were able to prevent these types of situations from happening in the future
6594151 as they step into the future with great anticipation won by one has one common goal they want to remain in the center of gods will as they continue and unmistakable sound of seamless harmony that has stood strong for five years without so much as even a membership change

6594163 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
6594164 i saw this start to happen while i was over there
6594165 i actually saw the moment when she decided to quit
6594166 she saw her two friends on the sideline she had forced herself to make it to them then she just veered off and stepped out of the race
6594167 i stopped off for some chinese before i came here
6594168 i know for sure what jesus would not do would be to sweep into a community gather up large numbers of people separate them from one another and deport them to another country in my own mind in my own conscience thats crystal clear jesus would not do that
6594169 were excited about the coming season and hope many of our fans will be able to come to the saturday scrimmage and meet our players and staff
6594170 they say that he is progressing all of his bodily functions are returning to him
6594171 he looks really terrible because hes lost half his body weight of course he didnt eat for eight days
6594172 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6594173 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6594174 even if you have to sit together for a week
6594175 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6594176 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6594177 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6594178 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group
6594179 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6594180 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6594181 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment
6594182 the knowledge of retouching is really coming about on a consumer level now
6594183 i got my start retouching for fashion photographers and of course the charge for that is 10 times what we charge on fotofix at these prices 4 95 for such things as teeth whitening or skin smoothing it really puts it within a consumers reach
6594184 one photo of yourself can be online for eternity people are more and more interested in optimizing their appearance what we do is provide a beauty service for your photos
6594185 i thought what if we got a bunch of designers together who could do this from an expert approach
6594186 how the skin should look we want pores to be reduced but still visible so it doesnt look like youre a plastic person
6594187 one thing you probably dont immediately notice is that we also brought the breasts higher and closer to the body
6594188 most of the time its publicity and business photos for actresses or actors or real estate agents
6594189 its become an integral part of our portrait studio work
6594190 we had one woman who said make me 20 pounds slimmer and im going to put it up on my fridge so i can see it everyday
6594191 107 advertisements estee lauder gucci dior etc 36 fashion pictures and the cover featuring drew barrymore

6594193 he was respected by his subordinates peers and superiors for his outstanding professionalism and his operational experience and his competence
6594194 we are just raring to go weve been basically building up to this point for the last 3 months we just want to get going get working on our job and come home
6594195 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6594196 as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with the technical knowledge that they generously used to assist the mission in helping the people of kandahar province
6594197 theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on
6594198 so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6594199 today all of canada mourns the deaths of three brave soldiers killed in the line of duty in afghanistan
6594200 these three soldiers were exceptional canadians who made a selfless choice to serve their nation their sacrifice will not be forgotten we will honour their sacrifice by continuing on with this vital mission
6594201 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive

6594203 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6594204 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6594205 i love your mouth and i love your smile it totally melts me
6594206 i take it personally as a rematch because they beat us in 2006 and hopefully we can beat them
6594207 i was thinking im going to get a base hit all the way
6594208 a lot of tears a lot of tears like most children in that situation
6594209 while many textbooks and articles have created the myth that the internet protocols were designed for warfare environments the top level goal for the darpa internet program was the sharing of large service machines on the arpanet
6594210 as a result many protocol specifications focus only on the operational aspects of the protocols they specify and overlook their security implications
6594211 in many cases vendors have implemented quick fixes to protocol flaws without a careful analysis of their effectiveness and their impact on interoperability
6594212 as a result any system built in the future according to the official tcp ip specifications might reincarnate security flaws that have already hit our communication systems in the past
6594213 scientology carries forward a tradition of wisdom which concerns the soul and the solution of the mysteries of life
6594214 the first thing i would like to point out to you is that scientology being what it is a study of life a how to livingness a synthesis of life itself which oddly enough at the moment knows a little bit more about life than life does you then have scientology penetrating everything and anything it comes into contact with
6594215 hay dos borradores de resoluciones sobre la mesa y mi lectura es que el consejo no est en disposici n de respaldar a ninguno de los dos

6594226 investigations indicate the fire is not suspicious and further examinations of electrical items taken from the scene will be conducted over the coming weeks
6594227 the update on the deadline is nothing is going to happen with it
6594228 thats whats going to happen with that i dont care about how many threats shaw wants to pull well be doing a press conference if elitexc doesnt see the light here pretty soon and if shaw doesnt stop talking expletive
6594229 as far as nick diaz hes not the no 1 contender out there
6594230 to elitexc he is hes the number one for getting eyeballs to watch them theyre pushing on eyeballs versus a career move for a champion like kj kj is really not the one who gets anything out of the fight diaz does and so does proelite
6594231 but theres nothing in it for kj unless elitexc finally wakes up a little bit thats why well have a press conference i dont like to talk and beat a company thats already beat down im going to give them the benefit of the doubt hopefully theyll see the light
6594232 i would think eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender
6594233 hes definitely ranked higher than nick diaz kj already beat nick diaz
6594234 thats not our problem people get married in five or 10 minutes
6594235 he had a long layoff but hes making more money than the no 1 ranked expletive fighter in the world anderson silva or the same amount
6594236 and now anderson silva is getting bud light sponsorships from ufc president dana white handed down to him
6594237 who do you think negotiated that expletive contract a year and a half ago and if you look at my post it the one i negotiated was a 7 million deal for four years its nothing close to 100 000 and 100 000 as a win bonus as far as trying to bring in the mark dion negatives and stuff good luck show me any negatives on it and thats just a pitch elitexc can use but hey i know my expletive ive been around this sport a long long time

6594282 hes pitched in big games before hes pitched in the playoffs youre not talking about a kid coming up that is a rookie and doesnt have a ton of innings under his belt in the big leagues were expecting him to throw well and keep us in the game and give us an opportunity if he can go six innings it would be great
6594283 obviously hes very excited to be back in the big leagues and to pitch for the club
6594284 his plan and his focus was to make it back this year and obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position

6594405 its just been building i guess its pretty obvious to see from the outside too what toddys brought in its pretty big just with who he is and where hes been that says it all i guess
6594406 off the field obviously theres been a lot of stuff go down in the last week but the guys are still in real high spirits and toddy and bevan just keep leading the way
6594407 theyll be hard theyre always a good side and a big strong side physically theyre probably bigger and stronger than us
6594408 the approach we take into every game is always different but all our patterns are all set out so everyones on the same page it makes it really easy as a player everyone seems to know where theyre going and what theyre doing
6594409 all the guys are just starting to buy into it and believe it toddy always goes on about how easy it is and how simple it is about doing the basic things when we start doing what hes told us to do the games been so easy
6594410 the start of the week was a bit of a mess as you can imagine when we ran out everybody was too excited probably we wanted to prove a point so bad and just forgot our structures
6594411 definitely our goal is the semis it feels good at the moment were on to a good thing and everyones happy and enjoying it now everyones just out to prove a point even more

6594421 some of the polish friends i have consulted appreciate the occasional opportunity to keep in touch with their cultural roots but they do not think that a separate sunday liturgy would help in the important work of integration within the local catholic community this is also the view of the clergy in the area
6594422 we want to pay for the church and help to maintain it we dont want it for free
6594423 when you go to mass you have to feel like you are talking to god and expressing yourself to god you have to do that in your own language
6594424 you cannot take in a dictionary and translate the words
6594425 asking for a weekly mass is something basic and now we have to fight for it our religious life here is very basic its really the bare minimum many people in poland go to church on a daily basis
6594426 we know we are in england not in poland and we dont have to stay here
6594427 but we are here and if its possible for us to have mass then we would really appreciate it
6594428 many people including some poles felt it was becoming divisive
6594429 some poles felt that if there was polish mass they had a loyalty and they werent sure whether to go to the usual english mass
6594430 poles were not getting the opportunity to get to know the catholic community and the clergy werent getting the opportunity to get to know the polish people
6594431 maintain their own traditions and at the same time keep in touch with the english church

6594585 who cares i want to get naked if they talk crap about me its just cause theyre jealous most of the people here know i can be a little wild anyway im an exhibitionist and half of my friends have seen me naked some people think thats slutty of me but i think they secretly wish they could be as comfortable in their skin as i am in mine i look good and i enjoy being naked so why not and my pussy needs some room to breathe too it gets suffocated from being trapped in my tight little panties all day long

6594598 but it was a lot of fun and great working with such stalwart seasoned professionals
6594599 to me bill is the great white shark that looks at minnows with no more
6594600 ele est de f rias no caribe e foi a um hospital local como precau o por um mal estar que sentia por causa de dores de est mago e gastrenterite n o foi para nada relativo a um ataque do cora o est bem saud vel e desfrutando do resto de sua viagem
6594601 acho que ele estava passando bem e provavelmente comeu muita comida com especiarias locais
6594602 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6594603 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6594604 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6594605 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6594606 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6594607 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6594608 while its got life its got hope he heard me singing and came over i looked at him and he was full of life he had a few scratches and cuts on him and i was a bit worried about his eyes
6594609 all he needed is a mothers milk there was hope another whale could pick him up and adopt him he could have at least learnt to swim with them and eat krill and plankton
6594610 well do an autposy on the whale to work out what was wrong with it that may have led to its mother abandoning it
6594611 the plane was rocking back and forth until i suspected it was going to fall
6594612 i saw people smoke explosions i think that is what woke me up because i had lost consciousness
6594613 i thought that if help did not arrive soon i would die
6594614 the plane would not fail to the point of causing a tragedy
6594615 most likely whatever the malfunction of the probe was it is probably not related to what happened
6594616 once a breakthrough has really been achieved the draft will be presented to the council of ministers
6594617 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6594618 is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team no but its also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either
6594619 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6594620 ive been eager for this title to release on blu ray
6594621 its one of our most beautiful and artistic films to date in typical celeste fashion yet is full of raw and hardcore sex scenes with industry favorites such as our own jana cova plus kinzie kenner and erik everhard
6594622 celeste has the amazing ability to capture sexual performances that our seemingly contradictions
6594623 lascivious liaisons is both intense and intimate fierce and passionate and it appeals to both men and women
6594624 while i admit to thinking jana cova was a major reason for the rating the levels of playful fuck for the buck and replay value also impressed me
6594625 lascivious liaisons was a solid combination of creative talent on both sides of the camera that many of you will find to be passionate energetic and very much appreciated so pick up a copy when it comes out fans of jana will probably want two copies given how lovely she looked on the cover as well
6594626 my desire was to emulate the innocence of the 1940s while exposing the kinky nature that lies beneath most things which appear too sweet to be true
6594627 growing up i remember hearing stories about how wonderful life was back then and how it was a different time a purer time i dont buy that any decade so thoroughly engulfed in war is bound to have a quite a few dark skeletons in the closet look at all the shocking hollywood scandals of the time starlets in the 40s could teach todays girls a thing or two about being bad scandals bad girls and words like lascivious are all about perception and who is doing the perceiving thats what im trying to show
6594628 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6594629 if it aint clinton i am voting for mccain plain and simple
6594630 if we play the wrong way well get beat and we dont want that to happen
6594631 certainly in the locker room right now theres enormous confidence not the arrogant confidence cockiness that i think did them in in olympics past
6594632 we didnt show respect to the world basketball community and it was going to take a commitment
6594633 you play for the name on the front of the jersey u s a and not the name on the pack of the jersey which is their individual names
6594634 theyve been beat and theyre coming back to save face so a team with that much talent whos on a mission could be scary
6594635 a gold medal is at the top of the charts
6594636 thats what they believe and to be honest with you that makes it fun because now you gotta fight you got a game
6594637 see oli t eline p rgu surnukehad olid nii tulised et k rvetasid n ppe
6594638 the prime minister thinks the military parade is inappropriate because of the cost at a time when ukraine has to cope with severe flooding but also because this flexing of muscles is a provocation
6594639 this is the first time weve seen this in seven years
6594640 why now and for what the president must be crazy to think he is scaring the russians
6594641 foreign and security policy has not before been an issue in ukrainian elections
6594642 but in the just beginning presidential elections it will be and it will be up to each party to explain their approach in the manifestos
6594643 we need a much more ambitious set of policies the eu cannot remain on the sidelines we need to demand that you the countries of western europe take a much more proactive approach to stability particularly in regard to frozen conflicts
6594644 the president took unilateral action in his announcement there must be a mechanism to cover this issue but if its not workable and not enforceable it could act as a pretext for the other side

6594665 i came across the ocean to a strange land but when i meet people that although we look different the spirit of friendship of people regardless of race is the same
6594666 it touches my heart that is why we can keep this relationship because of the spirit of friendship
6594667 when i was entering the country one of the reasons i told the official i was here was to visit friends it is really the truth

6594670 while my past actions were unfortunate and for which i have expressed to my family my sincere apology one blogger has alleged that official rules or laws were broken that simply is not true
6594671 its sad that my political opponents have chosen to resort to the lowest tactics by dredging up a private matter from years ago just 21 days before an election
6594672 four attacks in two days ships being hijacked and crews being taken and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable
6594673 this is the worst number of attacks that we have seen in a short period of time for years
6594674 give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control there have been seven vessels hijacked since the 20th of july

6594680 if you had a lock on the door they broke it they pointed their guns and shouted freeze and took away our possessions they took 1 000 yuan 80 if you had it or 3 000 yuan pictures of the dalai lama they broke on the floor and they arrested many monks we went to the police but they told us to get out
6594681 they build the roads they build the train to lhasa but they build for the chinese not tibetans
6594682 they send tibetans to school but then there are no jobs except nomad and farmer the jobs go to the chinese this is what i feel when i watch the olympics because on the television the chinese smile for the rest of the world but behind it they do so much bad here that is why i cannot support the team of china china which is cunning like a fox

6594701 from what ive studied i would not volunteer to be chained to the reactor the next time that happens
6594702 it seems like a little bit more than an x ray
6594703 i would be the first to say that our study doesnt prove by itself that there were high level radiation exposures but it is part of a body of evidence that is consistent with high exposures
6594704 the cancer findings along with studies of animals plants and chromosomal damage in three mile island area residents all point to much higher radiation levels than were previously reported if you say that there was no high radiation then you are left with higher cancer rates downwind of the plume that are otherwise unexplainable

6594783 some parents will be forced to stay at home to mind their children or job share in order to save money on childcare
6594784 it is an expensive thing and it is a worry cost location and finding the right place

6594789 it is shattering you are here representing your country qualified for the final i definitely had a very good chance i wont say of winning the gold medal but of doing very well tonight its all over within seconds
6594790 a huge amount of effort has gone into this and to have it end like this is devastating
6594791 apparently equi block is an over the counter product and freely available and if a banned substance is freely available it should not be
6594792 my job is to pick the best to represent us i go on available form and observation to do this at shows i advise the riders how to succeed in the ring but i also constantly remind riders of the use of products that they may have doubts about and if they test positive i remind them of the consequences for themselves and their country i make that point at every show
6594793 denis and myself would have a clear understanding of the consequences of using anything he would have had doubts about
6594794 but he had no doubts he has assured me he has used it a lot over the years it has the same effect as deep heat and he used it with all his horses and he had no worries about it as such he saw no need to inform us he was using it

6594805 we let darren enjoy today and well think about him degale tomorrow we dont want any hype or build up all he wants is to go in and do his business
6594806 hes fought degale on five occasions so theres nothing new we need to know about him his defence was perfect how can we change that the world silver medallist scores one point against you so you dont need to change that
6594807 the last time darren put him on his ass as well with a good right hand every left hook darren threw was like a lollipop in his mouth he couldnt miss it so were hopeful that we can use the same ploy good tight defence degale is very loose and once you close down the space he doesnt like it i think hell run out of ideas
6594808 we keep telling him to fight his normal fight which is a southpaw jeffries wont be able to handle a southpaw his right hook is key and his feinting
6594809 kennys feinting is excellent and when your man pops out nail him with the left hand
6594810 we try to keep it very very simple there are no major fantastic ideas about it then you can judge everything while theyre in there i can see it after 10 seconds so youll hear me shouting we can change it around the boys are very adaptable

6594826 i really think its going to be a fabulous series
6594827 the characters are interesting theres a lot of room for expansion of all the greek gods and bringing them all in in different storylines im so excited about it
6594828 our military advisor eric kocher was actually featured in the story and he put us through a two week boot camp the first week was personal training and knowledge of weapons a crash course on the marines boot camp and then the last day we did this siege where we went up into the mountains of namibia and had this faux attack on an arab town it was so surreal we were shooting with blanks it was the closest i want to get to war it was like cops and robbers times a million
6594829 it gave it a good bit of authenticity it was always good to have them on set especially eric kocher
6594830 saw a lot of humanity in him and everyone i talk to is like man youre scary but i didnt really see him like that i saw him as raised on videogames and when we were doing the boot camp stuff i was like man this is just like videogames it was just like grand theft auto and trombleys quoted as saying that in the book i could just relate a lot with trombley in general i think im a good person i dont think im evil bad or anything so i dont think trombley was
6594831 youre going into a situation where every day youre being shot at and your country wants you to shoot and kill if that same thing was happening in the u s it would be considered crazy and psycho but over there its considered honorable
6594832 i actually just hooked up my xbox live again i was fighting against doing that because i already play enough videogames and if i played online i would never leave my house but i finally gave into temptation and im playing call of duty 4 online i play with my brother its pretty amazing i rent a lot of games i rented civilization and that was dope and very very addictive i just recently rediscovered fight night 3 the boxing game i still havent beaten gears of war or the first rainbow six vegas but theres always new videogames coming out and i got the new iphone and theres an ign application on the iphone so i use that whenever i go to blockbuster

6594838 the parallels are there with the youngest member being the frontman and star
6594839 but the older jonases seem to have no issue with this arrangement and that could help them stay together
6594840 the same transition justin timberlake did from n sync star to solo sensation
6594841 with their goofy youtube clips thats a great way to push into the broader pop culture spotlight
6594842 the fact that the jonases have achieved success without a huge single really helps keep them on a solid career track
6594843 its just a guy weve liked for a long time
6594844 since weve got a month to go well just get as many bats in there as we can get

6594850 youre just trying to get into the round and kind of build some momentum on your side

6594852 i was surprised to shoot so low i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here
6594853 its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now
6594854 captain azinger i dont know exactly what hes thinking with the picks but i think hes going to pick the best players he can
6594855 i would love to be a pick but got to earn it too looking forward to that challenge and the opportunity the next couple of weeks
6594856 i thought i played nicely but middle of the round i missed a number of really good birdie chances and then took four twice and two sixes

6595368 our paramount objective during these challenging times is to retain value credibility with our customers and to relieve near term margin pressure through tactical price increases and further operating efficiencies within the company
6595369 we must avoid any undue prominence or giving the impression that we are promoting or endorsing products organisations or services

6595373 targeting 9 growth getting up to 10 it may look ambitious with the global economic slowdown but in the medium term it is achievable
6595374 i think as labour costs rise in china and theres a price to pay for pollution that we will see manufacturing coming to india
6595375 theres been for some time a sense that agriculture can no longer absorb any more people
6595376 india has become a net exporter of fdi foreign direct investment thats because it is too difficult to start up labour intensive manufacturing of the kind you find in china sixty per cent of indians depend on agriculture and i dont see that changing
6595377 the hardware estimate seems optimistic the auto industry seems in the right area
6595378 the important question here is what kind of jobs are created in the past it has been low security and low paid jobs in what is called the informal sector that needs to change
6595379 having a very liberated sexuality does not prevent you from falling into the awful trap of jealousy and does not protect you from the pain which accompanies it
6595380 the care and the rigour with which they described to me their sexuality showed that in a certain way they wanted to be like me
6595381 i think that any attempt to bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure
6595382 this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6595383 this entire book is based on the argument that meat should be something precious always to be savored never to be squandered if thats the cooks attitude your attitude then every time you sit down to eat a piece of meat will be a mood enhancing moment it may not be earth shattering though lets hope that once in a while it is but it should at the very least always be a net gain a ladder not a snake in the ups and downs of another busy day thats what mealtimes are for and thats what meat more than any other food should bring to our table
6595384 deep despair i drew myself the representative of an individual in despair with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of goyas peasant before the firing squad i formalised the drawing into a line and put a circle round it
6595385 going with my parents and seeing the cnd sign held up on broomsticks
6595386 a lot of people dont necessarily know the sign came out of the nuclear disarmament movement but it still has meaning to people it still carries a positive message of peace its become almost akin to a smiley face
6595387 sure its probably not what the hippies had in mind for it to become a marketing campaign for a department store but its a symbol of the mainstreaming of counter cultural ideas of things that were part of the alternative lifestyle like environmentalism and organic food isnt that ultimately what the hippies would have wanted
6595388 holtom is probably spinning in his grave now the original anti bomb marchers came from a very anti fashion perspective
6595389 these decades offer answers to present problems think of the 70s eco movement an alternative way of living theres a really strong connection between then and now

6595400 to defend employees at workplace level and no less within the national and international political economy requires a confrontation with the dominant policy logic of our age this implies that unions must turn or return to a self conception as organisations campaigning for rights contesting oppression inequality and discrimination it can also imply cooperation often uneasy with other social movements which have never acquired the respectability gained by trade unions in most countries potentially it redefines unions as outsiders in a terrain where until recently the role of insiders was comforting and rewarding

6595402 over and over a catalog of hand drawn patterns collects groundbreaking work from fifty of todays most talented designers who create patterns by hand and use them in their work in inventive and innovative ways from deanne cheuks patterns that adorn current fashion to those of robin cameron that explore her interest in art to garrett morins patterns that arose from an exercise for a character called eloie the examples in this book push the boundaries of the traditional concept of what a pattern is the selected works are often not an end result but the beginning of something else of something bigger and broader while the computer is sometimes involved in the production of patterns the hand drawn element is always evident in the uniqueness of these works featuring more than 250 vibrant and exciting patterns over and over explores this magic on every single page and will inspire designers everywhere

6595420 he can play third base play second left field center field and right field so we also got another good utility guy
6595421 discouraged council members from establishing and maintaining additional or alternate sites
6595422 we wanted to start off restrictive see how this thing works and see how people are able to work with it
6595423 we wanted it to be clear to citizens that when a council member is communicating with you online it is in an official capacity
6595424 weve taken out some redundancies and tried to give council members some bare bones direction
6595425 the city does not yet support blogging but i think it is moving in that direction
6595426 in both cases these acquisitions are really targeted at what were seeing as the natural evolutionary course of whats happening in data warehousing and analytics
6595427 all of the data warehouses that weve deployed are used in application environments where people are running business intelligence and more sophisticated analytics that they were unable to run in their prior environment either because of the complexity of having to tune those legacy databases or specific types of queries or because of other performance constraints
6595428 consider the fact that microsoft is touting enhancements in geospatial data handling as one of the most important themes in its recently released sql server 2008 all of which is available to the microsoft partner and customer dw bi data warehouse business intelligence applications and tools that run on or integrate with that spanking new dbms
6595429 more data warehouses are managing location data as another sometimes co equal data domain or entity hence netezza as a data warehousing solution provider recognizes that it needs to strengthen its capabilities in this area lest it lose business to oracle microsoft ibm and others that have strong location intelligence technologies built into their bi dw dbms stacks
6595430 both these acquisitions are targeted at driving an analytics agenda
6595431 in the case of what weve acquired with nutech were really looking to exploit an opportunity in the market around advanced analytics integrating the ideas around data warehouse and analytics with nutechs very advanced technology in the areas of data mining predictive analytics and optimization
6595432 theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
6595433 the only difference i see is they swear more here
6595434 weve had a lot of things said by opposing players about fans here
6595435 most of them you cant repeat thats their opinion they get to come from the outside and look in a lot of times and ive actually heard it they dont want to put their family and kids in a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids are going to have to sit through and listen to thats just the truth those arent my words those are words that ive actually heard
6595436 there are definitely guys who come back to the clubhouse and you see the expression on their face
6595437 its like man ive got to try to do something and theyre halfway defeated before they get up there
6595438 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6595439 its against detroit next tuesday thats where my focus is
6595440 i usually do a good job of getting out of those problems
6595441 its not like those errors would have ended the inning im not making good pitches after that
6595442 i had to battle the double plays were big give credit to the offense when you get five runs in the first three innings it gives you some cushion
6595443 youre going to get yourself in tough situations and you have to limit the damage
6595444 cliff has done a good job of that this season
6595445 only by putting it down in print can i save myself from madness

6595455 overall the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly but among republicans it is up 11 points and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points
6595456 there is a slight uptick from 40 percent to 46 percent among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion but it is up 10 points among republicans
6595457 it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift
6595458 it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics
6595459 voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all
6595460 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6595461 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that

6595476 ill gun your sorry ass down if you touch fifi my pet gorilla
6595477 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
6595478 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
6595479 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
6595480 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
6595481 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
6595482 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
6595483 the air conditioner guys are getting their jobs back they sweat so we stay cool
6595484 its the sound of the police you hou its the sound that i miss you hou
6595485 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
6595486 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
6595487 as they wished decision witheld they decided that i neednt to bother they liked me too much
6595488 but you said you are belgian it is your belgians who have brought this rule here
6595489 fast and easy money but they are so on the edge of not maintaining their current demand its a disaster in the making
6595490 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6595491 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6595492 this is a massive failure of duty what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6595493 it seems extraordinary that a private company should be entrusted with and then lose so much confidential data when criminal justice agencies are still unable to share computerised information between themselves
6595494 we dont take that kind of money on a novelty bet like this
6595495 sometimes we do the punter a favour and turn it down for their sake and say maybe you want to think about this
6595496 he would be the ambitious choice and he may well end up with it
6595497 unknown error 0xe800002e after some adjustments i was able to find a method to resolve or at least update my apps heres the key
6595498 obviously his strategists met on the portico of the mccain estate in sedona or maybe in one of his six other houses and decided what line of attack they were going to use
6595499 seven months of job losses for americans seven houses for mccain
6595500 ive said this before i would never have my campaign engage in a concerted effort to make cindy mccain an issue and i would not expect the democratic national committee or people who were allied with me to do it
6595501 because essentially spouses are civilians they didnt sign up for this theyre supporting their spouse
6595502 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6595503 the report shows that although america is one of the richest nations in the world it is woefully behind when it comes to providing opportunity and choices to all americans to build a better life
6595504 some americans are living anywhere from 30 to 50 years behind others when it comes to issues we all care about health education and standard of living
6595505 woefully behind when it comes to providing opportunity and choices to all americans to build a better life
6595506 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6595507 in the past weve usually had flooding in pockets i have not seen anything this widespread throughout the county
6595508 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6595509 this is the first day we can actually see the tops of the roads
6595510 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6595511 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6595512 we need support on the east coast and tim kaines a very strong candidate coming from the east coast
6595513 i think it would be wise of him to have someone whos a little bit outside the beltway and who has some rooted values
6595514 with joe biden he would be a good choice because of his foreign policy experience and his stature
6595515 i think he fits with the message of newness and change in washington
6595516 he had told her to pack a bag just to keep it ready so if she needed to leave at a quick time she could be ready
6595517 she was plotting this and acted on it two days later
6595518 i dont think embarrassed would be the world i think it would be relief if we actually saw her it would be happiness but thats not where we are at this point in time
6595519 he was scared we were going back and forth telling ourselves ok but we were thinking the worst
6595520 not about ego self aggrandizement getting their name in the press
6595521 there are people like dick lugar a republican who id listen to on foreign policy
6595522 do you agree with senator lieberman that senator obama has not put the country first
6595523 a na ve young 30 year old man with limited knowledge limited wisdom
6595524 people have not had the opportunity to hear from the son when youre running for office and you want a seat you really should have made some sort of communication with the district that youre running in
6595525 i am truly honored to accept the nomination to replace my father emil jones jr who has served this 14th legislative district for the past 35 years
6595526 i myself have been a resident of the 14th legislative district for 30 years now ive been involved in various community organizations economic development is my strongest point
6595527 for the first time in a decade belarus does not have any political prisoners
6595528 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
6595529 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
6595530 we will continue to look into pfeifers past to see if any other incidents of assault on children have taken place
6595531 this is a gut wrenching case and pfeifer deserves the stiffest of penalties for his actions
6595532 the reunion with dave was the greatest thing they could have done but why didnt they just keep mike one more time they just cant do the right thing by the fans i dont know why that band theres just something quirky to where they its almost like they wanna just push em the fans as far as they can and see if theyll still come back
6595533 we all hear it everybody hears it why dont we have the big stud
6595534 but if you can get that out of your mind for one second i know its difficult for a lot of people but we think we have six really really good receivers we think theres no question in our minds we can with the super bowl with these receivers
6595535 who like john mccain have so many homes that they just cant keep track of the number
6595536 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6595537 theyre all owned by cindy mccain her dependent children and the trusts and companies they control
6595538 john mccain and charlie crist keep showing they are a better pair than any of us thought
6595539 jet setting lifestyles mansions dotted across the country 1 800 hotel rooms and 520 shoes both john mccain and charlie crist are completely out of touch with florida
6595540 the fact i had never come across honour killings before i came to england and i grew up in dubai is quite telling
6595541 were trying to change the idea that honour killings are all about islam anywhere you have a societal structure with a very strong social fabric where reputation is important in a community is where you find honour killings
6595542 fred you can get the answers to these questions yourself by reading the book and you should not be sending me questions unless you cannot find the answer there
6595543 it looks like i got on exam 3 and a for the class
6595544 my semester with a deaf student at least i think she was deaf because she was pretty weird and i think i saw a little plastic thing in her ear
6595545 the number of cases of measles is on the rise across the country there were 1 726 confirmed cases in england and wales in 2006 and 2007 more than in the previous 10 years put together when there were 1 621 cases
6595546 estimates by the department of health suggest a measles epidemic in britain could affect between 30 000 and 100 000 children and young people
6595547 the doh says that around 10 of measles cases require hospital admission and one in 5 000 are fatal
6595548 there is no scientific evidence to justify claims of a risk of autism no link has been found and such studies have been debunked
6595549 parents who do not get their children immunised risk the health of their own children and other children
6595550 the arrogance is stunning the stupidity is off the scale but give the mother of a newborn something to fight against and logic is history
6595551 the measles return and current fears for an epidemic are the result of reduced mmr uptake following the claims the vaccine is linked to autism but numerous studies have failed to find such a link and we are completely confident that mmr is safe
6595552 the research that led to suggestions of an mmr link with autism came from dr andrew wakefield and 11 colleagues at st georges hospital london it was later discredited he and two others are now charged with serious professional misconduct before the general medical council
6595553 part of the reason for the increase is likely to be improved diagnosis and greater awareness in schools of the problem
6595554 okay i am getting so tired of seeing this same stupid discussion played out over and over again its always measles vs autism other dreaded diseases vs autism vaccination vs dreaded diseases how about this for a choice no vaccination no autism and no dreaded diseases
6595555 if theyre so very worried about mmr uptake maybe just maybe they should actually do the unbiased rigorous studies that will prove it is safe the fact that they havent already done so makes it apparent that they are too afraid of what they will find
6595556 ds advocate the thing you should notice about the 1918 flu survivors and their antibodies is that the antibodies developed naturally in response to those individuals actually contracting the flu not in response to a vaccine
6595557 as for the hordes of measles cases that would be clogging the hospitals oh the horror why dont you ask your parents if that was the case when they were children before the measles vaccine existed does anyone remember any news stories about how the hospitals were unable to handle all the measles cases hardly
6595558 at what point will parents b realize that the re emergence of deadly disabling infectious diseases of the past are not an acceptable alternative
6595559 when the observer newspaper published an article in july last year questioning whether mmr could have contributed to the rise in autism the director of science media centre intervened
6595560 so as you can see the vaccines arent really all that effective are they
6595561 how many children with autism drowned least year deadly indeed
6595562 a parent should not have to choose the threat of disease versus the threat of autism
6595563 why is the media creating this hysteria over a possible measles epidemic when it isnt happening now
6595564 the protection provided by getting measles as a child is lifelong the protection from vaccine frequently wanes this means that there is a huge pool of people adults from whom the consequences of getting measles are much more serious that face the risk of getting measles
6595565 if you dont vaccinate youll get the measles and die
6595566 a 13 year old boy has become the first person in the uk in 14 years to die from measles the victim was from a travelling family living in the north west of england the health protection agency said a string of outbreaks mainly in england and waless travelling communities has led to 100 cases so far in 2006 compared with 76 in the whole of 2005 the boy who was suffering from an underlying lung condition had not had the measles mumps and rubella vaccine
6595567 the dark night is not an abstract notion on some list of spiritual experiences every seeker is supposed to have the dark night descends on a soul only when everything else has failed when you are no longer the best meditator in the class because your meditation produces absolutely nothing when prayer evaporates on your tongue and you have nothing left to say to god when you are not even tempted to return to a life of worldly pleasure because the world has proven empty and yet taking another step through the void of the spiritual life feels futile because you are no longer good at it and it seems that god has given up on you anyway
6595568 the emptiness of the dark night is a yielding emptiness it is an emptiness that gives way to the fullness of all possibility which manifest as limitless diversity which circles back to emptiness it is the impossible to translate
6595569 god spoke only one word for all eternity and he spoke it in silence
6595570 and it is in eternal silence that we hear it
6595571 i dont drop character until i done the dvd commentary
6595572 i talked him on the phone last friday and he didnt tell me he was sick or anything
6595573 he was a fantastic leader who didnt back down to anybody players owners or reporters
6595574 i saw him in discussions with owners where he was super tough and didnt back down as a player you had to respect that
6595575 i remember the first player rep meeting i went to in 1990
6595576 i was as green as i could possibly be in terms of the union and union matters after listening to him speak for 45 minutes i knew i was in good hands
6595577 career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled
6595578 had the clarity of vision to understand that the true best interests of players was not in strikes and picket lines but in partnership with the board rooms of wealthy owners

6595584 the consumer has absolutely no idea what million dollar producer even means the larger question is what does the industry want them to think it means does it mean success does it mean that you are working with the best does it mean that the consumer can feel confident that all will work out well i think not the fact behind the label starts with the question what is produced is it 1 million in revenue 1 million in income 1 million in gross sales prices 1 million in net profit 1 million worth of listings sold 1 million in sales as we all know the board of realtors sets the criteria for what constitutes this designation what is interesting is that when you attempt to find out what these designations mean it is difficult to find an answer

6595591 no puedo decir que a gaby mercedes lo despojaran de la medalla dorada aunque s puedo afirmar que el hecho de que mario v zquez ra a quien tambi n es de m xico estuviera presenciando el combate fue algo que le dio ventaja al azteca y al final los rbitros se inclinaran por el mexicano
6595592 esto trae muchas conjeturas la decisi n a favor de p rez porque luego de la pelea en una entrevista por la cadena cnn en espa ol la cual yo vi guillermo p rez dijo haberse sorprendido cuando el refer le levant la mano indic ndole que hab a ganado el combate

6595606 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6595607 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6595608 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6595609 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6595610 its great that we have wireless email and wireless internet and stuff like that but at the end of the day it would be nice to have wireless recharge as well

6595686 youll have to give it to the doctor so they can charge your bill to your health provider
6595687 because you dont want to tell me your last name
6595688 maybe i see no point in giving you my last name
6595689 the doctor also said that you were dehydrated and havent eaten in days why were you at the gas station you had no money what were you going to do there
6595690 some of the people in the gas station were convinced that you had something to do with that
6595691 you cant shoot electricity out of your hands can you
6595692 still its strange that the lights exploded the way that they did and that lightning bolt i dont know how you could explain that
6595693 excuse me detective but i would like a word with the patient
6595694 whats going on with our patient hows her gunshot wound healing

6595696 reed you know that i cant tell you doctor and patient confidentiality
6595697 come on mark shes keeping her identity a secret and i want to know why what is she hiding
6595698 i ran her blood test and something wasnt right i ran it again and it was the same results
6595699 you think that shes in shock maybe from an attack
6595700 i guess you want to finish asking me those questions
6595701 do you have any family or friends in the area that you want me to call
6595702 you dont do you well were not too far from new york city if that helps

6595707 weve got more problems in our city than this missing girl detective
6595708 but what so she disappeared from the hospital maybe shes a runaway
6595709 with all due respect chief but you didnt meet her you didnt speak with her i think she is in trouble and yeah maybe she is running away from something but whatever it is or whoever it is wont let her just run from it
6595710 is this some guilt trip because of what happened to your partner
6595711 this has nothing to do with what happened to him
6595712 i expect you to be working on another case tomorrow one that has to do with the gang activity growing in this city dont think that you are off the hook after that screw up a month ago

6595718 you are late on your car insurance which will be terminated if payment is not received by
6595719 yes im detective gregberg and i would like to ask you a few questions about bailey winters
6595720 you could say that the night after she closed she stopped showing up for work
6595721 its retail detective its a revolving door people come in and people go out besides she was having problems with some of the associates here and probably decided to leave
6595722 miss eva niles and what does it matter baileys gone now
6595723 look detective i just took over the store and only have been here for a month or two
6595724 no i didnt like her most of us here didnt especially dane
6595725 yes dane you can im detective gregberg and i would like to ask you about bailey winters
6595726 no man i never touched her why what happened to her
6595727 she was attacked thats what happened to her and you seem quick to jump to your own defense maybe i should take you down to the station for more questioning
6595728 look look i moved her car okay thats the only thing i did to her i swear it
6595729 you moved her car how did you even get the keys to her car
6595730 the store manager gave me the combo to her locker
6595731 i moved her car one night while she was closing we were hoping that she would quit after that it took awhile and she did
6595732 if i find anything linking you miss niles or anyone else to her disappearance i will come back here and arrest all of you you people disgust me
6595733 i had nothing to do with her disappearance you hear me nothing
6595734 well daniel do you want to tell me why you took off like that
6595735 she came running out of the woods screaming she was dirty and bloody
6595736 i headed back to my car for my cell phone when i got struck by a car
6595737 i felt the impact and then there was nothing and she brought me back
6595738 the driver of the other car i think she killed him
6595739 when i came to the other car was stopped in the middle of the road the driver was lying face down next to it i read the newspapers and they said that the man was electrocuted by lightning some freak occurrence but i know different she did it
6595740 i felt like electricity was running through my body and thats when i woke up
6595741 i got up and went to my car she followed me and i let her into the front passenger seat and we left the last time i saw her i think i dropped her off at a bus stop
6595742 she didnt want to go there and i was not going to argue with her
6595743 because i know she killed again and its my fault isnt it maybe she was supposed to die out here
6595744 just do it and have the police bring dogs with them
6595745 actually my nickname is red and you can call me it since you found this gold mine here
6595746 you calling the graves of five innocent girls a gold mine
6595747 look detective you know what i mean if you hadnt found this spot nobody would have known that there were graves out here
6595748 that she did mustve been a freak lightning storm that night i mean two men both die the same way one here and one on the road weird
6595749 hey bailey winters was seen in a gas station which got robbed the man robbing the place was electrocuted the lights above him just exploded and he got struck with lightning or whatever the hell it was
6595750 if she can do what you say she can do you are going to need the help
6595751 no detective you didnt miss a thing i just thought you deserved the credit for finding that sonofabitchs grave and the graves of all his victims
6595752 now the families who have worried endlessly over their missing loved ones can move on to grieve for their loss and then move on to begin their lives again
6595753 nobody would have known those poor girls fate if it were not for you detective
6595754 look at you mr hero i get shot up and when i come back youve become the star
6595755 all i did was find their graves i didnt save anyone
6595756 the only reason why we found where they were buried was because of bailey winters and she is still missing
6595757 your finding was an open and closed case winters is an open case
6595758 the girl needs help didnt you say that before detective
6595759 you have cliff and red at your disposal reed if you need any more assistance in finding this girl please let me know
6595760 look i get that you are protective of this girl but you failed to mention a few things to the chief about her
6595761 i wanted to know what kind of person we were dealing with
6595762 look thank you for your help thank you but i dont need it
6595763 if this girl can do what you say that she can do and it seems like she can then there are other parties very interested in her
6595764 you can lead this case but i will be right there beside you
6595765 no youre not you want to use her hasnt she been put through enough
6595766 you have no right to be here red no right
6595767 im sorry reed but the decisions been made enjoy your publicity
6595768 i heard the beating you took for last months failed sting op im happy you didnt get suspended
6595769 maybe i shouldve most of the guys here they wouldnt have bothered with a runaway like bailey winters
6595770 and nobody would ever have found those dead girls and the body of that serial killer
6595771 hes using me to get to her and then he will use her
6595772 forget it im done wherever she is i hope she stays there
6595773 what about her family they dont know whats happened to her and they want to find her if you dont do it somebody else will somebody like red
6595774 hey you left me and i got shot several times
6595775 i almost died while you took a bullet in the shoulder
6595776 you dont want to trust me fine fine be that way but with or without you we are going to find her reed it would just be better if you were there
6595777 im sorry he stepped away from his desk do you want to leave a message
6595778 when i went to the bathroom she called my desk but she didnt leave a message
6595779 so why would she call me if she was a cold blooded killer why would she care what i thought
6595780 you said it yourself red that there was a little girl involved and that was why she attacked and killed the guy
6595781 first of all dont call me red we covered that before secondly on the way here yes i did say that but it doesnt change the facts she killed him
6595782 but if she wasnt here and didnt see the guy drag the girl into this room whos to say that the guy would not have killed the little girl
6595783 she killed somebody she shot like a bolt of lightning through him according to that little girl over there
6595784 what gives her the right to be judge jury and executioner huh
6595785 reed this is your case for now keep that in mind and do your damn job
6595786 yeah before or after she kills the next guy that does something wrong
6595787 weve been so worried the f b i was here and they are looking for you are you okay where are you
6595788 im fine mom i just wanted to say that im sorry
6595789 about what that fight oh forget about it and come home please come home bailey
6595790 im fine i just cant come home yet but ill be in touch dont worry about me
6595791 yeah the call was made from a payphone about two miles from here outside of caseys diner
6595792 what makes you think that she will still be there
6595793 not much but i could try to get it started
6595794 if i can get it started could you give me a ride im just going a few miles out of town
6595795 sounds like me i have no destination either just living out on the road
6595796 how about we just drive over to the next town
6595797 not like anything is going to happen there anyway but people getting rowdy
6595798 cant be more than ten minutes ago the truck went that way
6595799 i dont know its like all the trucks that pass through here
6595800 nope but the police have a bare sketch of him
6595801 its really a general description brown hair brown eyes six something no defining features though
6595802 you never know if he was standing right here or not
6595803 he would be foolish to remain in this town after killing those people
6595804 how come you didnt leave with the rest of them
6595805 that i am and ill catch up with the rest of them
6595806 is there a problem with me asking you a few questions
6595807 the girl she got a name or should i just call her a girl
6595808 right here in this parking lot she was hitching for a ride and a trucker picked her up
6595809 i dont know one of the usual that passes through here every now and then
6595810 but you saw her get into the truck what did it look like what was the color of the vehicle
6595811 you can call me trevor detective and it was a truck it was a huge green truck
6595812 yeah theyre supposed to be good and i thought that i would check them out
6595813 listen if were done here then i really must go
6595814 its a nice suit jacket but it doesnt go very well with faded jeans im going to have to search you
6595815 fine you want the truth she caught a ride from a guy that had breakfast at the diner he had a green cadillac and took off in the same direction as the truck theres the truth
6595816 no and if you touch me i will sue you so fast that your head will spin
6595817 by the time back up shows up he wont be in there
6595818 cliff there are armed men in there protecting the guy do you think the two of us can really take them all down
6595819 what is with you did your wife take your balls in the divorce too
6595820 this is a bad idea this is a very bad idea all this for a guy who should go to prison for life
6595821 reed are you still at the diner jesus man you should have got me breakfast
6595822 were a few miles or so away from you we pulled over one trucker and were trying to get him to locate whatever driver was at the diner earlier that gave the girl a ride
6595823 this fed is going to take your case from you if you dont move your ass reed
6595824 hey lets cut the shit because we both know that you almost got us killed in that stakeout you were the one that did not wait for me remember
6595825 hurry up before our friend returns and wants to know who i am talking to
6595826 she wasnt picked up by a trucker the guy at the diner lied to you
6595827 that you are but you are not going to tell our friend that as far as he is concerned she was picked up by a trucker and you should try to find him
6595828 do this i need to reach her before that agent does i need to get her side of things she might not even know what she is doing
6595829 okay ill do it but if this backfires its all on you
6595830 dont you dare die on me cliff you hear me dont you dare die
6595831 yup one of those loud rock n roll type groups
6595832 you dont seem like the type that would be into the music mister
6595833 normally these shows might get rowdy but we dont need security for them i have a bouncer who will be here though why should i be worried about anything
6595834 no i just figured with a large crowd you might want some security around
6595835 when i think about the damage i did to you my heart is heavy
6595836 i acted as a bully and a tyrant and i am ashamed that i tried to strong arm social change
6595837 i know there are people out there who are being pulled into the same radical subculture that glamorized arson for me
6595838 radical activists who are cheering you on from the sidelines cannot know how it feels to have tried this how your ideals might change afterwards so listen to me no matter your commitment today when you bind to a crime like this you spit on the rich experience of life
6595839 without her participation and without her substantial assistance in this matter this case might not have gotten off the ground

6595852 you have a lot of nerve to say something like that to me
6595853 you couldve called me to let me know that you were coming back in you couldve been more subtle in that approach you could also find your way back outside detective
6595854 those three punks were working something something that got themselves killed
6595855 well i dont know what those three couldve been involved in we didnt have any kind of robbery no assaults we only had a few computers stolen
6595856 yeah this company x core decided to use this towns location as a tryout or some bullshit like that the computers had some sort of new chip in them giving them more of an ai ability i dont know i just authorized it and let them do whatever it was that they were going to do instead the truck got detoured and before the driver knew what was going on somebody shot him in the head the truck was then found later with all three computers missing
6595857 no funny enough the chairperson over at x core charlie nevers said that he would personally handle this and that he didnt want me and my men getting involved
6595858 if i had the extra man power maybe i wouldve looked into it but i did look into your guy
6595859 he stayed at a motel for a few nights paid in cash and then left that was it other than the diner
6595860 yeah but what if somebody already knew that they did
6595861 what if it was a setup the whole entire time
6595862 hear me out there was never going to be a tryout it was an excuse to get those computers out of x core get a few fall guys to heist it clean up the loose ends and take those computers to a broker
6595863 yeah somebody with criminal ties that can sell those computers for a nice price and deliver them personally to whoever had the highest bid that would explain last night
6595864 a bunch of criminals that were tied in with the mob were killed last night by our guy im assuming that he went there for the money and things went south
6595865 no i dont think he got his money or all of it
6595866 youre probably right but how are you going to find the buyer before he does
6595867 the only one that would know that those computers worked would be somebody inside of x core somebody that would have more to gain if those computers were lost or stolen i think i should pay mr charlie nevers a visit
6595868 listen this guy trevor has a hostage shes only a young girl if i dont get to him in time hell kill her
6595869 the fed and the cop out there think shes the bad guy but shes not shes innocent and i can prove it i just need to find trevor
6595870 please i need to find her i need to save her please
6595871 ill distract them then get the hell out of here
6595872 yes we wanted to talk to you about a guy we saw a couple of days ago at a diner here in town
6595873 do you have any clue as to what were talking about
6595874 yes i do you had a detective gregberg here awhile ago asking about that guy
6595875 did you i want to know everything that you told him
6595876 somewhere in the darkness i could hear a soft hum the sound was once faint and despite how soft its vibration was i could no longer ignore it it was as if it were singing to me somewhere from within the darkness it called to me it still calls to me and i cant ignore it something is happening and i cant stop it
6595877 the last thing that i remember is you handing me a bottle of water that you bought from the gas station what did you put in it
6595878 what would make you think that i would do such a thing
6595879 lets stop playing games trevor you lied to me you used me and you drugged me
6595880 youre a dangerous man and im sorry to think that that you were otherwise
6595881 what is it that you have planned for today you want me to kill more people is that it is it well forget it im not doing your dirty business anymore
6595882 prove it kill me heres your chance the only chance that you will get so go ahead kill me
6595883 see ive been watching you learning how you tick and i know what will set your abilities off im not threatening you yet so youre not getting defensive but the minute that i pull my gun on you and you see it coming then things will get interesting
6595884 im sorry sir but mr charlie nevers is in a meeting if you want to wait he should be out in about twenty minutes
6595885 okay well wait but could we wait in his office
6595886 he doesnt know that were coming and i wanted to surprise him
6595887 take the elevator to the third floor and his office is to the right the receptionist should be there and shell let you into his office
6595888 look im not saying that your idea is a bad one but hear me out youre talking about creating computers that can automatically draw energy from generators to stay operational
6595889 well whats to stop the computer from drawing energy from other generators with time the computer could evolve and take energy from any other place that has it
6595890 youre talking about ai and ai is not a factor with my computers
6595891 but all computers have some sort of ai charlie your latest creations proved that
6595892 so whats your point thats it not a good idea for a computer to be programmed to automatically tap into a generator to stay operational do you know how many businesses would benefit from that
6595893 look all im saying is that if something can tap into a large amount of energy it is going to eventually evolve and what it evolves into could become a problem for us further down the road beneficial or not
6595894 we should at least consider restrictions on your suggested computers
6595895 do you know what would happen to me if anybody knew who you really were
6595896 i could lose more than my job i could even go to prison
6595897 i told you to take out the middle men but not to make the fucking f b i s most wanted list
6595898 no but she did if anybody recognized her like i just did this place would be crawling with feds and then they would be up my ass and they would realize my part in all this
6595899 relax your security guard ate my money okay he took a hundred dollars and he didnt even blink with her standing next to me
6595900 youll get your money and then i want you as far away from me as possible i dont want anyone asking any questions about me or my computers and take care of her everyones looking for her
6595901 whats your account number and next time call before you show up that was our arrangement
6595902 i thought you were the right guy for the job and you had me a nervous a couple of times and now you show up with someone that the f b i is looking for and you didnt do a great job changing her appearance what the hell are you doing with her anyway
6595903 damn i forgot to have that other guy sign in
6595904 yeah some guy and a girl were here to see mr nevers actually i believe that they are still here
6595905 your mess the other night gave me a few clues as to where you would go next
6595906 whats going to be your next move are you going to call the feds in have them take me out
6595907 im sure that theyre not too far behind and before this gets any uglier all you have to do is let her go
6595908 see now youre lying to me and i should kill you for that and i probably will
6595909 look over the building detective your friends are already here
6595910 i kill you she kills me they kill her sound about right
6595911 see she needs to be stimulated to use her abilities she still has no control over them shame really because she could end this right now right here but she cant can you bailey
6595912 she doesnt have to use her abilities trevor either way you lose
6595913 shall we shoot it out and see who falls first
6595914 keep your gun trained on the guy and have alpha two keep his gun on the girl
6595915 he was right jason this whole time he was right
6595916 hey i told him to back off of this case i warned him
6595917 he should be praised not punished especially not by you
6595918 youre one to talk cliff he almost got you killed that sting operation went south because of him if he had called for back up
6595919 i got paid to take the guy out and i did everything that i could to keep reed out of that house
6595920 he took the responsibility for that sting going south but it wasnt him it wasnt his fault it was all me
6595921 reed is doing what he is always doing he is trying to save people even when he knows that he cant he still tries
6595922 holy shit sir youre not going to believe whats going on up there

6595924 senhor como isto acontecer e o que posso fazer para evit lo
6595925 a tradi o da igreja primitiva ap ia esta forma de morte para pedro
6595926 i dont really get why bitchy jones is the de facto standard of what a dominant woman is she is just one person writing about fucking her stable why not just live and let live
6595927 her ranting style detracts from any serious points that she may be trying to make it all sounds like sour grapes to me
6595928 it is rather frustrating when she is being discussed on tv as having such an influential and well read blog and yet has such narrow minded opinions
6595929 i do not think that bj is a dominant i do not think that bj is a woman and it really does not matter to me whatever bjs blog might have been worth has disappeared over the term of the blog it has devolved the same way that the news media has it is all about attention and shock bj is just another sanctimonious attention whore
6595930 im not particularly impressed by anything shes written but to each their own im sure there are guys wanking to it at this moment
6595931 personally i find bitchy jones more annoying than elise sutton
6595932 i could have agreed with and even sympathized with bitchy jones had she just refrained from the cheap shots and the insinuations that attractive pro dommes are fake undominant money grubbing bimbos
6595933 her rants about the word domme strap ons and feminization are just annoying
6595934 the profanity while plenty gratuitous lacks any sense of appreciation for the art
6595935 im not up in her business telling her shes not a real dominant because shes not hot so why is she trying to say that people like me who are attractive pro dommes are just a male manufactured joke
6595936 ill shut this damn thread down if this stupid bitchy jones shit gets started again lol the name alone screams koo koo
6595937 le encanta la atenci n que recibe en las ceremonias y se toma su tiempo para inspeccionar las tropas
6595938 i am not glossing over our present circumstance but i believe we can be effective and productive on behalf of the people we serve the public expects us to make real progress in solving the states problems
6595939 it is possible to fight what we believe in but find the middle ground to solve our states problems
6595940 if we can save that one life if we can save many lives not just through my bills but through the great work we all do we can make this place this hallowed place a place of great productivity a place that works for the people of californa and a place for people who have no hope in their lives hope
6595941 the pain inside me is crying out loud the pain inside me is killing me yet when i open to you you die you cant handle my pain you cant handle me i walk with death hand in hand the pain inside me is crying out loud the pain inside me is killing me i am killing you
6595942 step away step away from me step away step away from me cant you see death is beside me death is with me i am screaming inside
6595943 i dont know the last couple of deaths could have been explained but that last one bailey what were you thinking
6595944 it would have been too late for her he would have hurt her he would have killed her
6595945 nobody can do what you can do nobody can shoot lightning from their hands and electrocute someone
6595946 im taking their life im taking their life into me im dying and if i take their life i could live longer
6595947 all i know is that he killed me but i came back
6595948 im something else detective i dont know what i am but im something else
6595949 come on drink your coke and then we have to go
6595950 you might bailey but ill do what i can to help you
6595951 i thought i heard a gunshot and then i saw you fall down
6595952 i mean it was something something out of a super hero comic or something
6595953 the man that i was with at the bar did you see what happened to him
6595954 damn it i knew i should have killed him back at the diner
6595955 your solo act got people killed look what she did
6595956 look at them she killed them she killed them and you didnt stop her
6595957 repeat that statement reed i want to hear you say that she did not mean to kill them
6595958 that guy at the diner was after bailey just like we are
6595959 the guy that you spoke to and then i spoke to afterward
6595960 the shock of the bullet mustve set her off and thats why she did what she did
6595961 are you telling me that all these dead people and the scarred memories that the rest of the survivors have to live with was all just an accident detective
6595962 hey you dont get to hit me and then walk away
6595963 come back and finish this you bastard because we both know that you are after bailey for your own damn reasons
6595964 fine go home if i find out that you so much as sneeze in my direction ill throw your ass in jail
6595965 for getting too personal with a killer and getting people killed
6595966 you just dont want me to disrupt whatever you got planned
6595967 whatever i have planned look around you people are dead innocent people they came here for a good time and now theyre in heaven throwing a party
6595968 its not bullshit jason trevor shot her and she went off
6595969 you guys want to kill each other fine go ahead knock yourselves out in the meantime she is out there on the loose and god only knows what she is going to do next
6595970 no reed the f b i agent is right youre too involved for whatever reason because i dont even understand it you want to save this girl thats honorable but she killed people reed she killed people and you cant help us go home reed go home
6595971 there was a guy in here yesterday sitting in that booth
6595972 he was here when the feds and police came in
6595973 the one that tore the flier off my door like it was his property
6595974 how did he pay for his food cash or credit
6595975 cash i believe why he do something because he looked like he is one to do something like those murders
6595976 there were three murders here this week and then your friend shows up here yesterday with a real chip on his shoulder
6595977 the guy that committed the murders here killed people last night at a bar which got burnt down
6595978 i heard that story on the news before same guy
6595979 our guy well he loves his gun he shot one woman in her neck one man in his ear and another got shot through the back of his head on the news it sounded like a freak electrical explosion or something
6595980 i was there last night and someone got shot i saw a man at a diner in this town yesterday and it was the same man at the bar last night
6595981 so if i ask for a description you could give it to me
6595982 they were punks always looking for trouble i figured that they pissed off the wrong guy
6595983 one thing though the one that got shot in the ear amazingly survived for a little bit before dying he said west 87 that mean something
6595984 okay let me get that sketch artist to come in here
6595985 you killed him the one guy that could have saved me what do i do now
6595986 i became a monster nobody is going to save me
6595987 i left an hour ago and you were in the shower
6595988 didnt i i didnt stop i couldnt stop i killed them for what why because somebody shot me
6595989 thats right jack the f bi has just released a picture of the woman responsible for the heinous act last night at least twelve people are dead and five are unaccounted for police were ready to write off last nights destruction as a freak accident until the f b i stepped up with new information
6595990 last nights heinous act that killed at least twelve people was no freak accident it was caused by a single person weve been searching for this person in hopes of stopping her before she hurt someone but unfortunately we were too late because we were too late she set fire to the bar last night and set off the electricity in the building electrocuting twelve people the f b i will take part of the blame for our inability to track this young woman which is why we are asking you for your help in locating her now we would prefer to keep her name anonymous at the moment but we will distribute a picture of her to local newspapers and news stations please if you see her call us do not approach her she should be considered armed and dangerous in the meantime we have sealed this town off and we will begin searching for her we believe her to be in the area still and if you see her call us
6595991 what do i mean what i mean is that now it is harder for us to get to where we are going
6595992 my associates bailed on me and i need to conclude my business i hate to take you on a trip like this but now i cant leave you alone youre going to have to come with me
6595993 can you bailey you look exactly like you do in that photograph that they just showed on the news you wont get very far
6595994 well ill cut and dye my hair dont worry about me you dont need me with you
6595995 hey if you didnt kill that detective i would say to go running to him
6595996 what will it be you have nobody the feds have everyone now looking for you im your only friend what will it be
6595997 fine since i cant go home now i have nowhere else to go
6595998 because we were too late she set fire to the bar last night and set off the electricity in the building electrocuting twelve people the f b i will take part of the blame for our inability to track this young woman which is why we are asking you for your help in locating her now we would prefer to keep her name anonymous at the moment but we will distribute a picture of her to local newspapers and news stations please if you see her call us do not approach her she should be considered armed and dangerous in the meantime we have sealed this town off and we will begin searching for her we believe her to be in the area still and if you see her call us
6595999 give her a soda and have her sit at the bar away from us
6596000 it brought the feds right to my door and i told you that if i saw you again you would wish that you were dead so whats stopping me from killing you
6596001 why the hell does that make you happy its not like you had anything to do with it
6596002 thats besides the point the point is that shes here
6596003 i thought she had long brown hair not short brown hair
6596004 the feds couldve bugged this place they could be outside in a van and they could be coming in here any moment are you stupid
6596005 oh thats really smart alex what if the feds were really outside thats two more bodies on your tab
6596006 so youre just going to kill us just like that
6596007 you saved us from the other guys but hes the worse of them
6596008 in what this was your only errand right thats it were done remember its what you promised me back at the motel
6596009 im far from finished and i need your help by finishing it
6596010 thats what you want me to do isnt it kill people do you think i can control this do you think that i wanted to do this
6596011 do you all i want is to go home and back to my normal life thats all i want
6596012 well thats too damn bad its not going to happen bailey your story is going to end up one of two ways dead or in jail
6596013 i never swore to god ever however i will for you for you bailey i swear to god that you will live through this but i need your help
6596014 how can i trust someone like you especially if you cant control your ability
6596015 the scent of a killer is always fresh after their kill the sweet smell of blood fills your nose the bitter taste that follows is seeing the carnage that they left behind you want to forget that smell you want to forget what theyve done but they wont stop they never stop and that smell will always carry their victims back to you and if you are the victim who survives you will never be able to wash away that scent the scent of near death at the hands of a killer and i will never forget that smell i taste it every time i begin my hunt my search for them and the killers vary from mere criminals to pure evil however this smell is different its suffocated in innocence confusion and she doesnt mean to kill but she does anyway and im the only one that can stop her
6596016 i cant believe i was starting to like you you had ulterior motives since the beginning you sneaky son of a bitch
6596017 red will throw you in jail dont test him reed
6596018 yeah well instead we found another crime scene more dead bodies reed
6596019 come on reed face it you cant find her you have no idea where she went or what she is going to do next all you know is that she is going to kill again and maybe next time it wont be a bunch of mob connected criminals maybe itll be like that bar
6596020 yeah do you admit to almost getting me killed i took shit because of your mistake remember
6596021 it didnt have to go down the way that it did but you didnt wait always in a hurry youre always in a hurry
6596022 look i owe you so ill tell you what if i hear anything ill call you leave your cell on in the meantime i would get out of here if i were you
6596023 then get out of my car so i can go
6596024 its not going to end well for her you know that you have to bring her in
6596025 you know that and youre still going to find her

6596031 we were pleased by the report that there was not a significant injury to the elbow or shoulder that would prevent tom from pitching in the future

6596035 kevin heeft britney zijn eeuwige liefde beloofd en haar gezworen te stoppen met zijn schofterige en luie gedrag
6596036 britney is helemaal blij dit alles dat ze wilde horen
6596037 de besprekingen zijn nog maar in een heel pril stadium maar het lijkt erop dat ze een soort real life soap krijgt waarbij ze dagelijks door een cameraploeg wordt gevolgd
6596038 ik dacht dit is niet wat ik wil in het leven
6596039 ik kwam er achter dat ik dronk blowde en gokte omdat ik geen doel had in mijn leven toen ik achter al deze nutteloze dingen een punt zette kwam het succes en brak ik door als artiest
6596040 ik maak nu dingen mee waarvan ik nooit had gedacht dat ik ze zou doen ik ga bij voorbeeld ski n snorkelen en op safari eerder dacht ik wel eens dat of dat lijkt me leuk maar ik had nooit het besef dat ik het ook allemaal kon doen ik geniet nu veel meer van het leven
6596041 ik ben best geschrokken toen het bleek maar je moet er ook de humor van inzien dat kindje kan later op youtube zien hoe hij is gemaakt ik geloof dat hij of zij de eerste real live baby wordt

6596044 ik voelde me al raar toen we nog in de kooi zaten ik was misselijk maar een zwangerschapstest wees uit dat er niks aan de hand was later bleek ik toch zwanger tja een ongelukje ik ben in de gouden kooi op dennis gevallen omdat hij heel zorgzaam kan zijn maar me ook onder de duim kan houden dat heb ik nodig natuurlijk hadden we daar wel eens ruzie maar daar zit je ook 24 uur op elkaars lip en het is ook nog een spel dat is nu anders
6596045 we called him the governor when he was a player thats what he was he was one of those guys who conducted himself that way he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6596046 that was the same way he operated as an executive
6596047 n o sou santos dumont n o vou ficar inventando desculpas
6596048 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6596049 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and know about gene when he pulled around that left side its like a hurricane is coming through he wiped out everything that was there
6596050 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6596051 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6596052 gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled
6596053 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6596054 he was the equal of owners in negotiations and made the league a better place for all players
6596055 playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
6596056 he fought me for a while saying no i dont want anything to do with it
6596057 but when i got elected to the executive board to the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field
6596058 all too often when you start talking about those old raider teams everybody just thinks they were a bunch of nuts who just happened to play well together
6596059 but gene played the same way he was as an executive with the players association gene was very clever he was a clever player he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6596060 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that
6596061 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6596062 and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its not 2004 and its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present and you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago now is what matters and thats what i think
6596063 we thought about that 2007 world cup game all the time im not going to lie
6596064 weve seen brazil three times since that last match but it wasnt the same
6596065 on the world stage is when teams really come to play so it sat with us a little bit but we were confident in our team defending so i knew it was going to be a different game altogether
6596066 i cant even recall the saves or how it happened but all i know is that i was playing with a different energy tonight and it just felt so good
6596067 there were several different defining moments in this game i think
6596068 but you learn from your mistakes and it was something i learned from
6596069 i talked to the right people and clarified everything and got everything out in the open with them i think it turned out fine in the end
6596070 i would love to be a pick but ive got to earn it
6596071 looking forward to that challenge and the opportunity the next couple of weeks
6596072 i know im not a bust i know im far from it
6596073 i know theres a lot of hard work focus patience and determination itll all come to pass youve just got to weather the storm while its there and just continue to work your way through it
6596074 i definitely feel like i have something to prove this year
6596075 im ready to prove im one of those elite running backs year in and year out
6596076 i welcome the celebrity with open arms because i feel like i can use that to make a difference in peoples lives
6596077 theres no doubt hes one of the best athletes on the field
6596078 no matter who were playing where were playing hes one of the best athletes on the field if not the best certainly the talent level is there and i think the fire and the passion for the game is there
6596079 weve all had that time in our career where thats happened to us and you kind of just have to take a step back put everything in perspective and really kind of almost start from scratch
6596080 kinderen adopteren is echt iets van deze tijd het is hip het voelt haast raar om er zelf een op de wereld te zetten

6596082 ik kwam britneys moeder lynne tegen in de videotheek en ze vroeg of ik een vriendin had
6596083 toen britney beroemd werd mocht ik niet vertellen dat ik haar vriendje was dat was een klap in mijn gezicht
6596084 ze vroeg of ik met haar wilde trouwen ik dacht dat het een grapje was maar ze was wel degelijk serieus er gingen geruchten dat ik geld aan het huwelijk zou hebben overgehouden maar dat is onzin
6596085 ik vind het psychologisch interessant en niet wreed anders zou ik het niet doen

6596087 you know i havent thought about that band in a while they put out their sophomore album i forget its name a few years ago and even though i liked it it was a grower that i needed to spend more time with to truly appreciate and i never did not as great as their debut silent alarm but i think it got a bad rap from fans and critics i should really give it another listen today i wonder what those guys are up to
6596088 yet here i am today and i love all of them and still remember all the lyrics that my friends is the sign an enduring pop song ive always liked faith no more
6596089 it was weird because i had two bees in my pants three holes later
6596090 you know it was rough out there when the bees are attacking you the course is hard enough but when the bees start getting you youre in trouble
6596091 every hole was behind 18 trees so i was just trying to shoot the ball into the fairway where i got a clean look at the hole
6596092 it was just i had some good momentum going and felt like things were turning around for me

6596094 about the custom of some to stand for the ten commandments what is the reason for this custom and should others follow it
6596095 when it is unclear why one is favoring the ten commandments over the rest of the torah i e when one reads the ten commandments daily but here merely standing on shavout or parshat
6596096 knowing his fathers position on newly discovered manuscripts that he took a dim view
6596097 the party giving the oath was even obliged to read the ten commandments aloud from the torah scroll

6596110 a women came to me with her child and said mother i went to two or three places to beg for food for we have not eaten for three days but they told me that i was young and i should work and earn my living no one gave me anything
6596111 i went to get some food for her and by the time i returned the baby in her arms had died of hunger

6596117 the most beautiful emotion we can experience is the mystical it is the power of all true art and science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead to know that what is impenetrable to us really exists manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms this knowledge this feeling is at the center of true religiousness in this sense and in this sense only i belong to the rank of devoutly religious men

6596128 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6596129 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6596130 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6596131 there are tournaments where ill shoot 6 or 7 under and thats as good as i can play and the winner is 21 under and im thinking how did they do that did they quit after 15 or what
6596132 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play

6596257 i have a lot of fond memories from last year but i hope it doesnt happen again

6596270 sit down with your children on a daily basis and catch up with them
6596271 if there is a change in the family structure that may change a childs behavior let the teacher know
6596272 because some kids do better with background noise i also recommend that kids study where parents can see them a computer should also be in a space where parents know whats going on parents need to make sure they have good firewalls and software to bar inappropriate sites
6596273 if younger children feel they can tell you the good and bad from school theyll continue to do that as they get older
6596274 you need to tell your children that they can tell you anything that you will always listen that you wont be mad at them for telling the truth even if theyve done something wrong

6596282 nicole plays guitar and deejays we are very musical and try to show this while on stage our vibe isnt like your typical group because nicole deejays shes able to command the crowd and every once and a while well bring the guitar out on stage to show our versatility
6596283 were so excited about the music weve recorded for this album weve grown so much in the last few years and experienced love heartbreak fun times sad times and everything in between the content on the musical is really reflective of our personal experiences
6596284 were giving our fans a glimpse into our lives as nicole and natalie also the production on this album is extremely tight we worked with some of the most talented writers and producers in the industry the album is a pop r amp b album with a hip hop base its very true to who we are and is finely crafted we cant wait to release it
6596285 we grew up in a household where music was always played our dad deejayed from sunrise to sunset its because of him that we learned to appreciate all genres of music and have always been open to experimenting with different sounds and vibes
6596286 when we auditioned for cipha we didnt know what to expect but he embraced our performance and soon after asked us to hit the studio with him
6596287 at our first session he played us the coolie dance riddim and within 30 minutes of hearing it and vibing out wed written
6596288 we had no idea what would come of it but he kept saying the song was gonna be big same way he believed in us we believed in him and the song took off
6596289 when we were signed to universal records we always felt disconnected they didnt understand us as a group and didnt give us the proper attention a label should give any artist they are trying to propel to success
6596290 after our last situation ended we knew it was important to sign with someone who believed in us our movement and our music from the beginning bryan leach got it it was as if he was a part of our team even prior to signing to his label

6596364 organisations seem to imagine that sticking to procedures is in itself a virtue
6596365 the majority of employees are too frightened of getting things wrong to make that effort give them a procedure and theyll follow it blindly
6596366 working to rules with no opportunity to use your initiative must be as depressing for employees as it is for us on the receiving end companies must be calculating that the frustration on both sides matters less than cutting costs

6596384 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
6596385 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
6596386 but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6596387 i know ive had this taste in my mouth a few times before
6596388 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
6596389 i was doing really advanced computer designs when i was 10
6596390 i just loved computers and what they were and ones and zeros and the logic and how they added
6596391 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks
6596392 sometimes when youre short of resources it forces you to do better work
6596393 i couldnt afford an online timeshare computer system i had to write down ones and zeros and simulate the computers operations it was all done by hand
6596394 sometimes i go into an apple store and say im an employee i get a discount they say whats your number
6596395 the internet takes all your time if you let it
6596396 we are communicating to customers around the country making sure that were answering any questions concerning it

6596398 this case suggests that facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily reintegrate themselves back into society
6596399 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement

6596405 cleantech group has the best written most informative articles on cleantech ive upgraded my subscription and have been telling others about it keep up the great work
6596406 one of our most important roles at new growth press is to enable our insightful authors to address pressing issues from the perspective of christian faith especially areas of hidden sin that have been sidestepped by the church in the past basically we write candidly about the issues that most people dont want to talk about
6596407 like everything else we publish with ccef these booklets are very gospel centered and dense with scripture this series is a great resource for churches who want to meet the changing needs of their congregations
6596408 so many of the issues addressed in this series are associated with deep shame and many people havent yet summoned the courage to talk to someone about their problems
6596409 the simple act of reading a booklet can be the first step toward confronting and dealing with their sin
6596410 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6596411 i remember getting a call from the er fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire and i said weve had such terrible loss of life maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it and they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse
6596412 this is why the 13 th floor is traditionally not included in a skyscraper
6596413 or if it is it is later taken out it is considered to be unlucky and our three year study consisting of some complicated science you are not qualified to understand proves it
6596414 we also recommend that cars no longer be made of steel because if they catch on fire then hot dripping steel could fall on passengers
6596415 home heating furnaces should no longer be made of steel either and the same thing goes for outdoor grills
6596416 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day

6596430 we have spent the past two weeks trying to change their course of action but to no avail
6596431 other preschools are being overflowed with phone calls and parents coming in begging for spots
6596432 there is nothing out there except 2 year waiting lists
6596433 she has had a period of time to make that transition
6596434 its is a transition and we understand transitions are challenging
6596435 i laughed i cried and at some points in the book i was clapping
6596436 so when i heard there were people who got upset about how it turned out i was pretty pissed off myself
6596437 dont listen to those people i just learned of the collection and have read all four in three days i missed a day of work and two days of eating reading these books id give anything to feel the passion and the love that bella and edward share
6596438 i bought breaking dawn the morning it came out spent all day reading it and returned it to borders just before it closed
6596439 the woman who gave me my money back looked like she was about to go into shock but i dont regret returning the dang thing from the start it just wasnt right
6596440 i think she is blatantly shoving her mormon faith down the throats of kids and not necessarily the best parts of it either
6596441 her series is rife with racist imagery drawn from the book of mormon and an anti feminist message drawn from same
6596442 its so beautiful to see how bella dotes on her amazingly precocious child
6596443 what makes me laugh is that people are getting angry at the fact that bella got pregnant with a vampires child calling it unrealistic when we are all reading a vampire series where a vampire and human fall in love realistic no but did we all fall in love with the idea of love conquering all yes
6596444 the outbursts regarding breaking dawn are totally unfounded i have recently started reading it for the second time bella and edward mature in this book and it was completely necessary for them to do so stephenie meyer explains in the book as to how a male vampire can father a child all one has to do is read
6596445 i am a fuming twilight fan i loved the first book true its mostly plotless and was really just a perfect boyfriend fantasy but it was addicting meyer should have stopped writing there first off in breaking dawn bella totally skips college in hopes of being with edward im not an extreme feminist or anything but seriously come on tweens reading this are getting the crazy idea that theyll be able to find a guy just like edward who cares about the wedding and wants to wait until marriage to fool around and always be there to save her notice bella always needs rescuing ugh what happened to the dark mysteriousness of the first book
6596446 it was the perfect happily ever after i read books to escape real life so i dont want to read a fiction book especially one about vampires and shape shifters that follows lifes dreary pattern
6596447 breaking dawn was awesome the book wasnt exceptionally well written but none of the previous ones were either sm gave everyone the ending we wanted also she mentioned the florida gators and as a gator i couldnt be happier
6596448 all of the fan criticism is overwhelmingly annoying i have no idea what they expected but its not as if the previous three books of the twilight saga are studies in plot and character development ive realized that these books are not about a teen love story but about the human capability for compassion metaphorically mastered in the guise of vampires
6596449 i know that most are complaining about the birth scene the other three books were all kind of clean cut nothing was too graphic in them so most were thinking that is what the final one was going to be but it wasnt stephenie meyer did a great job on it the book is about freakin vampires get over it
6596450 im a 21 year old male whos been a fan of the series for almost two years now and the final book was quite good in my opinion i believe that many of the fans complaining are having a problem dealing with the darker tone of the novel and are singling out minor and nonexistent plot holes in an attempt to validate their opinions
6596451 its impossible to please everyone those who were disappointed do not need to be so cruel about it
6596452 i actually refuse to count breaking dawn as part of the twilight saga i simply hated it the first two parts of the book read like a fanfic the characters were even off twilight taught girls about the difficulty of romance new moon showed girls that moving on is hard eclipse had the most powerful choices of all edward the reason she lives or jacob the werewolf rival the one who got her through the toughest of times breaking dawn had none of that there were no choices only the pregnancy thing which was a ridiculous choice and i repeat impossible it taught girls that all they needed was a husband baby and home for a good life
6596453 well folks if mr spock can come back from the dead in star trek anything is possible what would you have written lets see bella and edward have a short marriage since he could not perform so she obtained an annulment
6596454 i feel meyer really let her fans down the book had the ending we wanted but i feel that it was poorly written and it moved from being a well written piece of literature to a poorly written teeny bopper love novel
6596455 i did notice a few more errors than i wouldve liked but who cares seriously people chill out
6596456 if iran has weapons of mass destruction we should invade right
6596457 when a republican wears a little american flag lapel pin what is he trying to say
6596458 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
6596459 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
6596460 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
6596461 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish
6596462 because johns father was the naval commander in the pacific theater he was exploited with tv interviews while wounded
6596463 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head he has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand folks quite honestly that is not the finger i want next to that
6596464 they were godless communists my friends they deserved to be bombed bombed bombed
6596465 i would also like to briefly acknowledge that less than a year ago the events at ruatoki provided a fresh point of tension in our relationship it would not be appropriate or helpful for me to comment on the merits of the events of last october i know emotions are still raw and opinions strongly held but i am very pleased that less than a year later we are able to join together to show that it is the future that is first and foremost on the minds of ngai tuhoe
6596466 i think the tricky issues are around tuhoes desire and wish to have te urewera national park regarded as part of our territory the second one that would be difficult for the crown would be discussions over self government over mana motuhake and sovereignty
6596467 te r kau nei kei te haere ki te minita mo te hoki mai o te whenua ko te mana motuhake t hoe ae me whakawhiti korero t tou ko te mana motuhake t hoe kia hoki mai a te urewera ko te kaupapa nui inaianei me pehea me aha
6596468 to help ensure that revealing what police found relating to the terrorism charges will not influence those firearms cases we removed the names from the material
6596469 police needed to treat what was happening in te urewera seriously and needed to investigate to do anything less would have been to fail in their duty to protect new zealanders we believe that the police were right to act however we also believe the public has the right to make its own judgment on the polices credibility and to do that it needs as much information as possible within the bounds of the law and within the bounds of fairness to all those involved that is why we decided to publish

6596498 playboy has always done classy portfolios so im sure if this was real its something that would be considered
6596499 i havent heard that shes doing it and i havent heard that she isnt
6596500 it just proves he doesnae have the bottle to play for celtic or rangers
6596501 he is still very much a spurs player he played with his national team and i need to have a chat with him to see how he is physically after the journey home
6596502 but if he does play tottenham fans are the same as anyone and get behind the side if he starts scoring goals then those fans who were booing him last week will be cheering him
6596503 in my career as a manager ive signed countless shirts if a fan asks for an autograph you cannot control what they put in front of you it could be a blank piece of paper with an iou for 1 million i believe he was superb for bulgaria so lets hope he has something left in the tank to give us a victory on saturday

6596507 once you get into the routine its really fun for a coach anyway youre doing football everyday your meals are regulated and youre on a real good schedule in some ways you dont look forward to the end of it
6596508 all youre doing all day is football of course the regular season is like that to a great degree also

6596514 the move has been on the cards for a while and i could see how disappointed steven was when it didnt happen
6596515 the referees knew that a few of the managers have been incensed with incidents lately but they took it heard our points of view and then put their side over as they always do
6596516 i dont think its possible not to take something out of it but only time will tell if what we discussed comes to fruition
6596517 overall though i think its a good thing i often threaten not to go to these things but i think it can only help
6596518 referees are willing to assist and they are willing to listen there are little things that they tried to hold back but theres no point because thats why you give your time to go there and communicate
6596519 if youre going to do that then you cant hold anything back youve got to go and take it and get the replies discover what we think the problems are and make them aware of what we think
6596520 there are a lot of managers who say its different for us because its our livelihoods and theyve got to understand theres pressure and tension thats part and parcel of our job and you have to accept it
6596521 unfortunately we can get hammered for it referees have got to understand that its not their livelihood
6596522 there are certain referees that have good jobs and its not easy to give them up but maybe they should be working towards doing it full time because they can learn a lot about the game
6596523 theyll also be much fitter if they are full time
6596524 the 1000m was always the one i was more focused on wallace said alifying final victory in the 1000m on wednesday wallace felt the pinch over the final stages yesterday before sticking in gamely for third
6596525 the legs started to blow up in the last 100m and once your legs go your body starts to cramp up pretty tight and youve just got to try and hold on till the end wallace said
6596526 i dont know if it was the rain but normally we ride down to the course so the legs get a good warm up
6596527 even though we had all day i dont think i was really prepared for that race
6596528 i think tomorrow and the next day ill definitely have my race head on me
6596529 i was probably more nervous yesterday leading into the 1000 wallace said
6596530 today i was pretty relaxed and that was probably the problem i was a little bit too relaxed
6596531 ive been told that i have to start getting my race head on because sometimes im too fun loving
6596532 but i wouldnt do this sport if i wasnt having fun its not exactly the most interesting sport going round especially for spectators unless youre watching finals
6596533 you dont tend to think about semi finals that much
6596534 the review committee found weaknesses in the management and oversight of the equity finance business within anzs securities lending unit
6596535 taken together this meant that anz did not adequately identify and manage the range of risks which arose from the operation of a business of this nature

6596538 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6596539 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6596540 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6596541 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6596542 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6596543 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care

6596550 we are seeing a lot of employers considering moving to 25 if their children are full time students
6596551 if additional people are added to a policy that may increase the amount of claims incurred and will likely cause premiums to increase
6596552 i would agree with whoever says it would raise health care costs because i have undergone spine and back surgeries that have cost my parents plans in excess of a half million dollars
6596553 kids my age are usually involved in more rough things than older people think about it who plays in outdoor football leagues their kids in their 20s

6596564 weve produced one of the finest midfield players in the world in steven gerrard he is a colossus the portsmouth manager said
6596565 we stick him on the left wing hes not a winger he has got to be in the middle of the park where he can influence the game we are killing him
6596566 at the moment the liverpool potential transfer situation means he is not at his best capello observed barry can be forgiven an off game he remains an important player for england
6596567 they played for the first time without fear at wembley said capello of his players adding that international football was more demanding than the premier league or champions league because
6596568 the players are not recognisable from the ones we see in the premier league every saturday and sunday redknapp added
6596569 if steve mcclaren had been in charge of that team there would have been uproar wembley would have gone barmy what i think is the problem is you get people who play for their clubs and they are loved they play for chelsea like frank lampard and the fans idolise them
6596570 they come off here and they are booed by 70 000 people
6596571 footballs like life its about confidence if you have no confidence its very difficult they come out here and make a mistake and they know theyre going to get slaughtered at every opportunity and they just dont perform

6596595 i am delighted that i have the opportunity to make a significant difference to the fa
6596596 thats not the way we perceive being a champion i have no problem with him doing a show i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m
6596597 i understand the joy he might have interpreted it in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6596598 the reds this year essentially in terms of this level it was the first time i was looking
6596599 thats a very big wrap to me and something i am pretty surprised about
6596600 being under an injury cloud i was sweating a bit whether i would get an opportunity to tour just to get given the opportunity i was very happy with i dont know about topping a pecking order thats something for other people to talk about
6596601 missing out on the world cup squad was something i took as a big disappointment everyone you see who plays rugby has a disappointment in their career they dont make a team or a squad
6596602 but i sort of sat down after that and i wasnt very happy with my form in the arc and i thought its now or never its time for me to step up
6596603 i had a good pre season and i was happy with how i went then and then going into this season i didnt get too stressed about things
6596604 with a new coaching staff that brought a change everyone had a clean slate i didnt really look at it hard at the time but looking back i guess thats the way its been robbie and the new guys arent bringing any baggage or anything into the team environment
6596605 obviously discipline was a part of my game that i lacked not being ill disciplined but i tended to have brain explosions where i would do something stupid that at the time i thought was a good idea you look back and it wasnt
6596606 thats something i worked hard on not physically doing anything but logically in my head trying to work that out i just sort of said if it seems stupid at the time it is probably not a good idea to do it thats the way its worked
6596607 the highlanders had a full all black front row on the field and their pack was very physical but james was immense at the time he was only 20 years old and you knew then you had something that was going to be quite special
6596608 james is a rare breed in locks he loves scrummaging hes very dynamic off the ground in the lineout and hes very capable carrying the ball his support play to pick up his tries has been great he has a wonderful future ahead of him

6596624 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6596625 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6596626 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops

6596628 e stato poco pi che un buon allenamento per noi il napoli ha retto bene nella prima gara con la juventus ed ha giocato alla pari col milan nel secondo match poi abbiamo perso per un gol nel finale non meritando comunque la sconfitta in ogni caso abbiamo apprezzato linserimento di russotto ed il rientro di zalayeta non sono entrambi al massimo della forma ma hanno dato segnali incoraggianti e buone sensazioni
6596629 e stata una buona tappa di avvicinamento alle partite ufficiali un buon test dal quale ho tratto note positive ho visto una buona condizione generale questo ci conforta in prossimit dei prossimi impegni ufficiali e ci fa ben sperare in vista delle gare col vllaznia e la prima di campionato a roma adesso aspettiamo anche il rientro del pocho per poter completare il parco attaccanti ma quelli che hanno giocato sinora hanno fatto benissimo ed il loro apporto sar fondamentale per la stagione

6596649 the assumption or proposition that only the small states can you have retail politics is somewhat misleading and a bit condescending

6596652 we can beat four gold for sure in four years we could have five or six because we have the talent in the squad
6596653 this was the strongest sailing team we have ever had and we might easily have had a gold in the 49er and medals in the tornado and the mens windsurfing there are plenty of people in the wings waiting for their chance and we think there is more to come
6596654 we have been watching their races in the evening and we have similar philosophies we are going to keep pushing as they will we have six medals out of 11 classes not bad
6596655 theres no reason why we should not go in with medal expectations in every class for london there will be only 10 classes then and we hope to convert 50 the country needs to think how we can use home advantage to our benefit within the rules and not just about making a quick buck we need to support british athletes across all sport
6596656 the ballpark figure for us is 2m a year plus sponsorship we are not sitting back and expecting the public to pay we get the same amount per head as all the other sports in the world class programme and we top this up with sponsors while the individual sailors also have their own backers if we want to keep delivering medals we have got to keep investing in sport the gb team are one of the best supported but we try to deliver value six medals we have a review five days after we get back and there will be no resting on our laurels
6596657 this was the big one there was no fun and games before no olympic paraphernalia we knew we could do it because we have more talent on board than anyone especially this fellow next to me

6596662 what is more scandalous is it is not the first time the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety

6596666 i think wayne rooney gerrard and the other players that are not in a perfect condition physically will be very important
6596667 the movement of rooney and the work that he does every game is very important
6596668 played not only because he can take set pieces and free kicks but because he plays well that is why for me he is in the team beckham terry ferdinand are all the same if they dont play well they will not play
6596669 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best
6596670 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6596671 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6596672 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this series then im happy to do just that
6596673 concentrating solely on test cricket is the best way forward for me during the next phase of what will hopefully be a long england career
6596674 the last week has been slow and mentally draining and the bad weather has played a role in all of that

6596687 gov arnold schwarzenegger on wednesday unveiled what he called a compromise spending plan that includes a 1 cent sales tax increase he implored lawmakers to look past their partisan differences in the interest of the state but schwarzenegger had privately broached much of the plan with legislative leaders already to no avail the announcement marked the first time that the republican governor has publicly acknowledged his proposal for a temporary 1 percentage point sales tax increase despite campaigning for office twice on a no new tax platform the budget plan his third this year also calls for deeper spending cuts than democrats want and a larger rainy day reserve to head off future budget crises he also wants to raid funds from redevelopment agencies across the state an idea that could jeopardize or delay downtown and neighborhood projects in san jose republicans must step out of their ideological corner on the right and democrats must step out of their ideological corner on the left schwarzenegger said at a news conference we must meet in the middle he called it shameful that california reeling from a 15 2 billion deficit is still without a budget 51 days into its fiscal year still much of what the governor described simply made public ideas that hes pitched in closed door and thus far unproductive negotiations the reaction from legislators did not offer much encouragement that his announcement would yield a breakthrough assembly minority leader mike villines r fresno said after the news conference that republicans would not soften their opposition to higher taxes no matter what the governor says california requires a two thirds vote to pass the budget so schwarzenegger must win over at least six gop assembly members and two gop senators to move his plan through the legislature

6596699 overall i love the device but the 3g service could be better i get the sense that at amp t is still tuning the 3g network but they shouldnt be making us pay considerably more on a percentage basis for service that isnt much of an improvement or which remains inconsistent

6596711 microsoft is in more danger today than they have ever been because their basic models for delivering value through software are being challenged
6596712 midori makes sense as a research project today and may make imminent sense as an offering tomorrow once we know what it really is
6596713 but one thing is for sure it will be challenged on all fronts some will say it is not as good as windows some will say the os is no longer important some will say the cloud is too risky i say change happens and this would be supportive of a continued evolution to a service oriented world

6596808 organisations seem to imagine that sticking to procedures is in itself a virtue
6596809 the majority of employees are too frightened of getting things wrong to make that effort give them a procedure and theyll follow it blindly
6596810 working to rules with no opportunity to use your initiative must be as depressing for employees as it is for us on the receiving end companies must be calculating that the frustration on both sides matters less than cutting costs

6596819 they pay their house payment taxes insurance and theres not that much afterwards to take care of your family needs and have another 100 dollar tax with 60 percent going to foreign countries not even staying at home is hurting the economy as well as the family budget
6596820 the presidents action to open up more oil reserves seems to have an impact probably even more important was that the american people are looking for ways to conserve alabama is going to be a leader in converting wood to gasoline and diesel every bit of alternative fuel that we produce here such as gasoline or diesel or ethanol reduces our dependence on foreign oil and creates jobs in america

6596824 i dont know why there is such excessive law enforcement looking for an escapee that had an affair with a under age child with consent i dont understand it
6596825 he didnt commit a murder or nothing i know he broke out of jail and hes got other charges but he didnt kill nobody and he aint no threat to nobody around here
6596826 he can probably run these woods in the dark with his eyes closed better than we can with flashlights and dogs
6596827 tarps food cigarettes empty beer cans obviously it shows someone has been assisting him
6596828 im hoping that the boy decides i got no where else to go ill give up

6596835 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6596836 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6596837 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6596838 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6596839 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia
6596840 its a lot cheaper i only drive half the week
6596841 we carpool because were best friends and we live next door to each other and gas is expensive
6596842 last year we had 30 or 40 kids on the waiting list to get a parking permit
6596843 but this year weve got about 60 empty spaces we cant even give the spaces away this year i think its because of the high gas prices and those students who dont have a car theyre riding the bus this year and our buses are packed
6596844 this is one of those only in hollywood situations it could work out as long as reese doesnt visit jake on the set
6596845 a staffer in the mccain denver office opened a letter containing a threatening letter and a quantity of white powder staff immediately contacted local and federal law enforcement
6596846 staff are taking all necessary precautions including checking in with medical professionals
6596847 i was waiting for norv to give the punch line
6596848 then we went outside and the busses were there it was a fun morning
6596849 it was good to give them a day like this
6596850 we got four big linemen in one of the inner tube rides and we thought all the weight was going to carry us over the side a couple of times
6596851 it was really cool of norv to give us a break and allow us to get out and just have a good time as a team
6596852 i guess when you get that much weight going so fast it just carries you
6596853 he pushes us hard but also rewards us like he did today its been a great camp we got a lot of good work done during the offseason and it just carried over into camp today was a great way to close it out
6596854 he is now being placed under strict conditions on parole until completion of his sentence
6596855 i got this friend of mine tommy farese who could probably nail this for you paul had no idea al knew me fast forward again my phone rang and the rest is history
6596856 now were almost facing calamity because were not careful with our spending
6596857 i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6596858 having a good education is very important for our athletes

6596860 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6596861 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6596862 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
6596863 instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals sen
6596864 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6596865 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6596866 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines

6596869 acho que foi um exagero o recurso pois o dagoberto n o cometeu infra o alguma isso ficou muito bem claro para a comiss o que o absolveu foi um lance normal de jogo e ele pisou sem querer no advers rio pois estava desequilibrado na jogada
6596870 estou chegando para ajudar a equipe a voltar para o lugar de onde nunca deveria ter sa do que a s rie a acompanhei alguns jogos da equipe na s rie b do campeonato brasileiro e tenho certeza que com muito trabalho o grupo vai dar a volta por cima

6596880 losing to the germans in athens was a bloody lesson for us
6596881 we have created chinese hockey history but that is not enough
6596882 we want to change the world history of the sport by becoming the first asian womens team to win the olympic gold
6596883 the girls have told me they can do it i am sure they can
6596884 the world no 1 team were denied their second olympic gold since 1984 when they were stunned by germany in the athens final four years ago
6596885 we have a lot of confidence going into the final we will prepare well for it china is a very good side and it should be a great final
6596886 we will try to find motivation for our next match thats my role as captain
6596887 its difficult because our goal was to win the gold medal
6596888 we were determined to fight i think that through our courage we walked this far but we were limited by our capabilities
6596889 to defend against lionel messi is the biggest thing we have to do we just have to make sure we stay close to him and we dont give him the chances like we did the last time in the under 20 world cup

6596891 i support the northland unions stop the drop campaign to prevent the new zealand rugby union axing our team from top flight rugby
6596892 this contrivance driven from wellington nzru is an affront to the north northlanders should respond to this offensive recommendation
6596893 i think we have got to show people outside of northland what we desire
6596894 we need to have a solid show of commonality in the northland union that we want to be part of this competition we need a critical show of support and a sounder commercial base
6596895 we had to stop the operation at midnight and resumed around 6 30am yesterday we spotted the wreckage at 7 15 am

6596900 all findings by a practitioner have to be based on solid evidence which can stand up to legal scrutiny and examination as and when is necessary hence leaving no avenues for errors or cover ups
6596901 it is not the role of the examining practitioner to determine whether the incident was consensual or not absence of physical findings in alleged victims of serious sexual assault do not necessarily indicate abuse has not taken place
6596902 having said that i would like to stress that one cannot be absolutely certain that sexual abuse or otherwise has taken place simply based on preliminary physical examination findings
6596903 no lay person should also make his or her own interpretation of what may have happened simply by looking at the medical records without being given the benefit of the circumstances and other important information that only the examining medical practitioner may be privy to
6596904 the medical practitioner needs to piece together the jigsaw from the history the physical findings and the forensic reports to arrive at the most probable diagnosis
6596905 as part of good medical practice the diagnosis should include the nature of the condition its seriousness and the causal factor
6596906 between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of their operating cost is the price of diesel which fluctuates daily according to market rates
6596907 however ticket prices for passengers are fixed so passengers are not burdened with higher costs but operators are hit hard every time the price of diesel rises
6596908 he was the quiet type but we were very close and during his stint in kuala terengganu rarely a day went by without him calling us to relate about his stay here
6596909 the last time we met him was when he was on leave about a month ago
6596910 mohd farid said he was lucky to have been able to crawl out of the plane to safety as he was worried that the plane would explode
6596911 i could not get a ticket out to terengganu until morning and it was not knowing whether my son was alive or not which haunted me throughout the night
6596912 i find it easy to speak about tun razak as i not only served under him but i had also been influenced by his leadership when i was a student
6596913 even the deputy inspector general is not allowed to see him yet
6596914 he is already eating drinking normal food and is doing exceptionally well he can talk and his condition has stabilised
6596915 this is ridiculous we have all the evidence pointing to him yet the authority thinks otherwise
6596916 all this is tearing me and my wife apart we are experiencing an emotional roller coaster ride
6596917 as far as i am concerned we have not concluded the case who is the policewoman who contacted the family
6596918 everything is so misleading and we are in the dark it seems we are not getting much information and help from the police

6596926 to have water that is a five minute walk away is a prayer answered it is one of the most important things that we have wanted besides road access and a school
6596927 it was gruelling work but enjoyable as we worked alongside the local people who were not only friendly but took it upon themselves to take up the toughest tasks like carrying rocks and heavy material uphill
6596928 we also had the honour of attending a wedding ceremony which was a real eye opener and got to teach english songs like head shoulders knees and toes to the schoolchildren
6596929 but the hospitality and friendliness shown by the local people more than made up for any hardship we were constantly being invited to their homes given food and invited to play football with them
6596930 one family even invited us to watch the beijing olympics opening at their house
6596931 but one of the most memorable experiences was fishing for little fish and river eels they were slippery and squirmed out of your hands so fast it was very exciting
6596932 were very pleased with the results these communities had an unreliable water supply

6596989 discussion of whether to put a re entry prison on state owned land in paso robles is heating up again as corrections officials consider a new round of grant funding and such a facility could be twice as large as previously proposed sheriffs department officials in santa barbara county now want to be part of a 500 bed re entry prison that would be located in paso robles
6596990 just more than a month ago after working with the state for several months under the presumption that it had its permission the santa barbara county sheriffs department received word from the state that it will in fact not be able to run what had been planned to be a jail with a re entry facility in north county on july 3 the sheriffs department received a letter from the california department of corrections and rehabilitation notifying them that a contracted law firm offered a legal opinion that the planned joint facility couldnt be operated by the county under the terms of ab 900 which set aside 1 2 billion for new jails
6596991 the sheriffs department says it no longer wants a new north county jail paired with a state re entry facility after learning that state workers not county employees would operate it

6597003 they butt heads and i think the goat thinks hes just as tough as the buffalo hes not scared when he does it i think the buffalo is a little lenient on him because he could really throw him if he wanted to
6597004 i tried to separate the two put the goat in a smaller pen and the buffalo took the fence out so the goat could get out
6597005 they see this big buffalo chasing him and you know most of the time its play and they think that the buffalo is going to kill him

6597081 fogel added that an allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6597082 viacom has no alternative accept to repeatedly search the entire youtube library
6597083 and send take down notices this is a massive effort we have manually reviewed over 1 7 million clips on youtube and have identified more than 187 000 pirated clips of our copyrighted content in an effort of this scale some inadvertent error is inevitable
6597084 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6597085 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must masturbate over whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6597086 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6597087 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6597088 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6597089 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage

6597135 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently

6597200 there is a large and growing market in supplying basic research tools to scientists funded by the 3 billion california stem cell initiative as well as scientists entering the field world wide and our long term plan is to be the first profitable company in the stem cell sector
6597201 we are already offering our first research products through our website embryome com where researchers can also access our stem cell database
6597202 a naturally occurring signaling molecule is a good start toward using external cues instead of genetic manipulation to reprogram cells
6597203 but we still need to eliminate the need for retroviruses for the three other genes
6597204 is the same pathway acting in the human system and can wnt molecules be used to reprogram human cells we dont know but i think those are very important questions to investigate

6597230 though i dont at all want to diminish the horrible tragedy of abortion i believe it is more godly to aid a single mother in poverty than it is to shout from the comfort of my living room that she shouldnt have an abortion

6597234 i think its quite clear the government cares quite a bit about it and he cited all these examples from china as well as parental matchmaking sessions it was quite refreshing at least the government is thinking of different approaches to this

6597248 jangan kau katakan apa yang tidak kau laksanakan ini berarti seorang pemimpin memiliki konsistensi antara apa yang dikatakannya dengan apa yang dilaksanakan jika saat kampanye ia mengatakan akan memberikan pelayanan maksimal kepada rakyat akan membangun fasilitas pendukung dalam pembangunan masyarakat akan memanfaatkan potensi daerah dengan efektif untuk pembangunan maka itu benar benar direalisasikan sewaktu ia menjabat sebagai pemimpin bukan malah sebaliknya menggunakan kedudukan dan jabatan sebagai kesempatan memperkaya diri dan mengambil keuntungan untuk pribadi keluarga atau golongan tertentu saja ken blanchard dalam bukunya di atas menyatakan ada lima ciri dari seorang pemimpin yang memiliki hati yang melayani pertama seorang pemimpin selalu melayani kepentingan mereka yang dipimpinnya pekerjaannya selalu berorientasi pada kepentingan publik yang dipimpinnya bukan kepentingan diri pribadi maupun golongannya kedua pemimpin yang melayani memiliki kasih dan perhatian kepada mereka yang dipimpinnya kasih itu mewujud dalam bentuk kepedulian akan kebutuhan kepentingan impian dan harapan dari mereka yang dipimpinnya ketiga seorang pemimpin yang memiliki hati yang melayani adalah memiliki akuntabilitas dimana seluruh perkataan pikiran dan tindakannya dapat dipertanggungjawabkan kepada publik atau kepada setiap anggota organisasinya keempat pemimpin yang melayani adalah pemimpin yang mau mendengar setiap kebutuhan impian dan harapan dari mereka yang dipimpinnya kelima pemimpin yang melayani adalah pemimpin yang dapat mengendalikan ego dan kepentingan pribadinya melebihi kepentingan publik atau mereka yang dipimpinnya pelayanan dengan kepala berarti adanya manajemen dalam sebuah kepemimpinan karakter dan kharisma saja yang dikembangkan dengan prinsip melayani dengan hati dalam kepemimpinan formal tidak cukup ia harus pula didukung oleh sebuah sistem manajemen dan visi kepemimpinan yang jelas banyak pemimpin kharismatik gagal saat ia menjabat sebagai pemimpin formal nothing motivates change more powerfully than a clear vision

6597261 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6597262 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6597263 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6597264 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6597265 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year
6597266 it shows we do have support for what we are doing it gives us a sense of pride
6597267 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too
6597268 the mccain camp is scrambling to deflect the damage from mccains inability to remember how many houses he own heres what mccain spokesman brian rogers came up with
6597269 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
6597270 the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war is rich is outrageous
6597271 the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff its not as if he lives in ten houses thats just not the case the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use
6597272 again unfortunately this is a koala that has been bashed to death and then after its dead they removed its leg
6597273 so all we have at this present point in time is four of the 16 modules that make up that environmental impact management plan the remainder havent reached my desk yet
6597274 given the time that these modules have taken to be delivered to the department satisfactorily then it is unlikely that gunns are going to meet the october 4 deadline
6597275 the bottom line is that the core purpose of the environmental management plan is to define a set of environmental parameters within which the mill must operate
6597276 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6597277 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6597278 this government is going to see significant and extended industrial action for the coming months unless they wake up to themselves and actually make an offer that means that the real wages are maintained over the next couple of years in a high inflation environment
6597279 the reserve bank understands this the federal government understands it inflation is high 3 25 per cent wont fix it
6597280 the state government is trying to force public sector workers in main roads in qbuild in hospitals and in schools across the board to try and cut their wages by only offering 3 25 per cent when inflation is running at 5 per cent
6597281 this is unfortunate that the government wants to basically to cut wages and no one can afford to do that in the present economic climate
6597282 so the government and the minister involved warren pitt main roads minister are going to have to have a reality check
6597283 this is the strongest strident our members have taken so theyre sending out the message theyre very very serious about getting a decent pay
6597284 the initiative opens up a range of substantial policy options for the government to energise the teaching profession to reward the most outstanding practitioners and keep them in the profession
6597285 the first step is to make sure we can recognise the best teachers who improve student learning
6597286 to make sure that schools and school systems can begin to consider the methods of ensuring that these teachers are appropriately rewarded
6597287 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make five million dollars and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6597288 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6597289 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6597290 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula a salad plant and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans

6597296 i am not a prude in fact i am quite broad minded but this is completely inappropriate for children
6597297 i bought the book for my niece as a present and was reading it when i came across the word
6597298 the book has an attractive cover and is clearly for children they should not have to be subjected to trash and vulgarity
6597299 i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang
6597300 she comes to visit me regularly and we read to each other
6597301 we have all the enid blyton books such as the famous five and secret seven and had finished all of them
6597302 i thought i would get her something a little more modern and had heard about jacqueline wilson through the popular tracy beaker television series
6597303 i knew she was held in high regard and had been a childrens laureate but thought i ought to read through the book to make sure it was not too sad
6597304 i got to the page where reference was made to a toffeenosed twit
6597305 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but then i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6597306 i asked her if she was aware of this word and if she could do something about it
6597307 i would like her to explain how she would want me to explain this to my daughter even if it is in the context of the character
6597308 in the context of the character we felt it was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie would speak to each other
6597309 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6597310 however in light of this response we have decided to amend the word when we reprint the book
6597311 since the book was launched in march this year we have sold over 28 000 copies and this is the first complaint we have had
6597312 jacqueline wilson books are extremely popular with our customers and are the top selling childrens books in most high street stores
6597313 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6597314 the publisher is aware of the word that is featured in the book and has agreed that it is not appropriate for children and will be reprinting copies
6597315 as soon as these copies are available we will stock them in our stores we are sorry for any upset caused

6597356 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
6597357 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
6597358 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
6597359 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
6597360 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
6597361 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing
6597362 sometimes i get angry at the dictionary and let loose with a muffled yell
6597363 the point at which i became bored has long since passed

6597366 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6597367 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6597368 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6597369 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6597370 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6597371 an unforgivable traitor to his country responsible among much else for the assassination by his soviet associates of many brave men all i can say is that in the half of him that i knew the deceitful half of course he was a most enjoyable friend
6597372 her mother handed her to us and the woman stayed behind there were too few firefighters at the beginning
6597373 the girl was totally disoriented she did not complain or talk despite the great number of serious injuries which she had
6597374 this fireman has become perhaps without intending to the hero of the day
6597375 kept asking me if it was true what was happening
6597376 he thought it was a film and he kept asking where was his father and when the film would end
6597377 its condominiums where ill have them get to you he said before quitting the campaign trail for three days to strategise with top aides as both the candidates finalise their choice of running mate
6597378 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong he said
6597379 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6597380 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6597381 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place senator obama said
6597382 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6597383 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns he said on cnn before introducing senator obama in chester by countering republican charges that the relatively inexperienced democrat is too
6597384 to put somebody in the white house who says i dont know much about the economy thats whats risky mr kaine said recapping senator mccains own confession that he knows more about national security than about economic affairs
6597385 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6597386 having the inside of the mouth of someone else it didnt belong to me it was atrocious
6597387 select cd cor id categoria nm categoria from categoria order by nm categoria
6597388 i cannot think of a more winning ticket than one that reads obama kennedy
6597389 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment
6597390 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films
6597391 an unforgivable traitor to his country responsible among much else for the assassination by his soviet associates of many brave men all i can say is that in the half of him that i knew the deceitful half of course he was a most enjoyable friend
6597392 the concept of substitution may be said to lie at the heart of both sin and salvation for the essence of sin is man substituting himself for god while the essence of salvation is god substituting himself for man man asserts himself against god and puts himself where only god deserves to be god sacrifices himself for man and puts himself where only man deserves to be man claims prerogatives with belong to god alone god accepts penalties which belong to man alone
6597393 senator mccain sometimes has trouble keeping up with how many houses he has thats why from whenever to whenever he failed to pay whatever amount in taxes and got away with it but not all american taxpayers have that option thats why barack obama is offering a broad middle class tax cut that will etc
6597394 im sure the blood will be pumping when i go out to ride for the first time
6597395 i have been riding work since i was about a ten year old
6597396 ive gained some great experience and im excited about taking the next step
6597397 im probably closer with her than any other horse in the stable
6597398 ive won a trial on her and ive also strapped her in all but one of her starts
6597399 the wide barrier is an issue but hopefully we will be able to get across and have a decent run during the race

6597429 the only one i personally approached or made an offer to was darius the others i just said if you get an opportunity to go somewhere well take it
6597430 if you cant ill be in the background for you if you need some help but the bottom line is i havent approached the others officially because i thought they could get better deals elsewhere other than at st george illawarra
6597431 the innuendo is that ive been a fly in the ointment or that players wouldnt come with me to the dragons
6597432 im just sick of the half snide little remarks and comments to suggest the players wanted to go because they didnt and secondly that they declined to come to st george with me
6597433 the players who are leaving are all hurting but theyve got on with their lives and for people to suggest they either didnt want to stay here or i had an involvement somewhere when they have become available well it just hasnt happened
6597434 the building industry and local councils have asked for clearer and more detailed advice on how to deal with noise complaints and how to work in a way that avoids them in the first place
6597435 the solutions can often be as simple as installing a noise wall avoiding dropping materials from a height or avoiding reverse alarms by organising the site so delivering trucks only drive forward
6597436 twenty years from now we can replace oil the vast majority of which we import with homegrown product generating thousands of jobs millions in tax revenue and billions of dollars of investment

6597438 i look forward to receiving advice as to the technical differences that contributed to the councils estimate the barraba proposal will cost three times the finished cost of the coleraine pipeline
6597439 given the importance of securing a water supply for the barraba community it is crucial that every aspect of the proposal be very closely examined
6597440 i cant criticise until ive seen all the figures and documents in front of me but im glad that peter draper has raised it
6597441 while it may sound like a similar set up with the same pipes same pumping stations and similar terrain theres just no knowing the differences without knowing all the facts of the contract
6597442 im not a pipeline engineer but if we could get something more like 7 million or 8 million instead of going out to 15 million wed have a better chance at getting funding
6597443 we would be very pleased at getting any confirmation about the breakdown of the costs from council and we will be holding out for that
6597444 we would also like to see nsw water minister nathan rees and his department
6597445 we have 125 security guards and about 40 police if it gets close some will come from other areas to the ground so if he gets to 98 or 99 goals we will have more security on hand on the ground to make sure everyone is safe
6597446 we are telling people not to run out but if they do in large numbers we have procedures in place to ensure everyone is safe everyone knows where to go and what to do if it happens
6597447 it depends if its safer to leave him there or take him off he will be surrounded by his teammates and then police and security
6597448 west coast have been briefed and they know where to mingle if he kicks it the umpires and some of the hawthorn players and the eagles down the other end will have their own separate security guards

6597453 the silence from both tiers of government has been a real worry
6597454 we contacted senator wongs office on monday and while they confirmed they had received my letter they admitted that there had been no response for well over six months and even apologised
6597455 the message to both morris iemma and kevin rudd is that water is the main issue in the tamworth region and it can no longer be ignored
6597456 everyone at ag quip relies on water as a vital input into business
6597457 the chaffey dam augmentation shouldnt be considered an afterthought to be put off well into the future

6597477 its the order we are looking to use this week we will be looking to matty to put the afterburners on and we will respond to what we see
6597478 its a matter of how far he goes al has performed really well for us and we know he is capable of going the distance
6597479 matt doesnt have the same volume of game time under his belt so that serves us well this week
6597480 its going to be dry its going to be fast so that order serves us well
6597481 he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6597482 its good to have him back but most importantly its good for him
6597483 he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6597484 he is a point of difference we have versatility in the mix

6597522 di gerai kedua ini untungnya lebih bagus lagi bisa rp 13 juta per hari karena lokasinya di tepi jalan besar
6597523 yang menarik dari waralaba shop amp drive yang dikembangkan grup astra ini tidak ada fee waralaba pada tahun pertama dan kedua biaya dipungut di tahun ketiga yaitu 2 dan tahun keempat 4
6597524 modal rp 3 miliar itu belum termasuk dana rp 200 juta untuk biaya software sistem dan pembelian produk tertentu
6597525 sudah mulai banyak bertebaran cabang kebab baba rafi di kota malang sehingga persaingan semakin ketat
6597526 meski begitu kalau mengacu pada proyeksi franchisor termasuk cepat sebab prediksi mereka untuk pay back period gerai kedua ini dijanjikan pada bulan ke 13
6597527 selain harganya terjangkau saya sendiri juga suka produk ta bnana
6597528 bervariasi kalau sepi rp 400 ribu hari dan kalau ramai rp 1 juta hari
6597529 tergantung tujuan kami sebenarnya jika kami ingin mengembangkan area bisnis ya beli saja hak waralaba utama di daerah tertentu sehingga orang lain yang akan buka di sana harus seizin kami namun kalau cuma punya satu tempat kami lebih suka takeover yang track record nya bagus dengan begitu target cash flow lancar tahun depan sudah dapat untung
6597530 bangunlah gerai di daerah padat jangan cuma hitungan di atas kertas kami harus keliling daerah itu amati tiap hari kalau perlu
6597531 jangan sampai kehabisan stok bahan walaupun cuma sekali sebab pelanggan bisa pindah ke pisang crispy lain yang banyak tersebar di sekitar daerah ini
6597532 orang astra sendiri mengakui dan mendapuk saya menjadi semacam penasihat bagi calon franchisee yang akan membuka bengkel shop amp drive
6597533 orang beli oli kami periksa juga ban aki rem suspensi dan yang lain kalau ada yang perlu diganti kami bilang sejujurnya
6597534 kami lebih suka kalau franchise fee dibayar tiap tahun ketimbang dibayar di muka kami kan belum tentu sukses kok sudah disuruh bayar
6597535 kalau saya beli lahan di kelapa gading tentu harganya lebih mahal dan pasti waktu bep nya lebih lama
6597536 dengan begitu kami tahu langsung masalahnya di mana pegawai pun jika tidak didatangi langsung tidak akan berterus terang kendala yang dialami apa saja
6597537 kami melihat ini cukup efektif menarik konsumen dan baru kami saja investor yang melakukan model hadiah seperti ini
6597538 kami ingin buka outlet bengkel lagi tapi belum pasti apa tetap memakai shop amp drive atau membuat toko sendiri ini buat bisnis keluarga kami bengkel yang lain akan kami wariskan ke anak supaya dikelola
6597539 sistem pembagian keuntungan waralaba alfamart kan tiap tiga bulan sekali sekarang saya sudah punya dua gerai kalau tambah satu lagi saya bisa dapat keuntungan rutin tiap bulan kan

6597752 theres so much going on im pretty much just letting my music lead me
6597753 i grew up a trumpet player but i also play guitar and bass and keyboard
6597754 inspiration comes from life itself the good times and the bad
6597755 i pull inspiration from as much time as i spend around children its almost like storytelling from all my traveling
6597756 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6597757 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6597758 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6597759 bodnar made no public statements himself but investors relied on his good faith in negotiating the apotex settlement agreement and committing the company to its terms
6597760 a woman who has the same assertiveness as a male is too aggressive
6597761 i think the main thing the opinion does is it takes the judge out of the quandary
6597762 where the defendant does not give him a definitive answer in words but through his actions
6597763 hopefully well see more application of the edwards rule that you cant fire your trial counsel
6597764 and this would have been a nice one to start with
6597765 today we recognize it is possible for a valid waiver of counsel to occur not only when a cooperative defendant affirmatively invokes his right to self representation
6597766 but also when an uncooperative defendant rejects the only counsel to which he is constitutionally entitled understanding his only alternative is self representation with its many attendant dangers
6597767 only dilatory behavior or other misconduct might justify waiver by conduct
6597768 our decision today is meant to provide trial courts with guidance and discretion not to force courts to discharge counsel against their better judgment
6597769 extensively warned garey on the record of the dangers of self representation
6597770 we would be unable to say the government had established jones waiver was knowingly made
6597771 now a criminal defendant has the burden of proving a negative
6597772 now hes got to prove that he doesnt have knowledge the absence of the warnings is typically evidence of lack of knowledge
6597773 im pretty sure that mr garey is going to require that i do
6597774 the courts ruling will give another tool to judges to deal with defendants who try to game and delay the system
6597775 delaying will only cost the people of nsw more more in the terms of dollars and more in the sense that more time passes before weve secured our future electricity supplies
6597776 i believe the leader of the opposition has got a unique opportunity here to put the day to day cut and thrust of politics aside and actually do something of value
6597777 an unforgivable traitor to his country responsible among much else for the assassination by his soviet associates of many brave men all i can say is that in the half of him that i knew the deceitful half of course he was a most enjoyable friend

6597793 but the stock was priced for ongoing perfection and we didnt get perfection
6597794 we are downgrading crm to a neutral rating and lowering our price target to 65 was 81 as we believe there is less upside in the business model
6597795 that has caused some concern about a slowdown in large deals
6597796 the business is changing because salesforce is becoming more strategic for larger buyers
6597797 this trend changes the timing for when the business comes in this doesnt mean there is less revenue just that its signed up later in the year
6597798 more than anything this setback was the result of a high valuation and high expectations
6597799 if the stock was not so pricey say closer to the low 50s then we probably would have just shrugged it off
6597800 a housing issue mccain not sure how many they own

6597810 why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders they dont wash their hands before they eat

6597828 in case after case beautiful waves curls and kinks were beaten into submission with blow dryers flatirons and extensions in one of the most curious cases a beautiful woman who was wearing a gorgeous and undoubtedly hard won afro was given stick straight extensions oprah you are well loved the world over due in no small part to your uplifting gospel of self acceptance yet in the eyes of curlies these makeovers send an unmistakable and most disheartening message that ones natural hair isnt acceptable

6597836 bush and cheney never address the biggest energy challenge we face global population growth
6597837 wed have to extract the oil from the equivalent of 32 arctic national wildlife refuge drilling areas just to meet their needs
6597838 at current consumption rates the oil drilling recently approved by bush in the gulf of mexico would satisfy the worlds energy needs for about 56 hours

6597843 if you cant read at least half of an email message without scrolling then you need a bigger monitor
6597844 of course in de beers defense the pitch has to hit a receptive audience
6597845 how come we never discuss the cost of a gift in general but when it comes to engagement rings the price tag is everything people want to talk about
6597846 oh yes i hate diamonds too my husband gave me dirt for our engagement
6597847 dirt i got a starving rwandan child i am better than you
6597848 to those of you who claim to not believe in diamond engagement rings i bet if you were given a substantial solitaire you wouldnt hand it back
6597849 we have been sourcing grapes from the willamette valley for a dozen years now but honestly dont recall a vintage like 2006 yields were high potentially too high for the grapes to fully ripen but ripen they did in fact theres a group of folks that think the 2006 oregon pinots are too ripe too immediately accessible we dont agree with that assessment perhaps 2003 seemed too ripe to us but in 2006 the high yields slowed the grapes sugar accumulation keeping it in line with flavor development this was the best of both worlds with the only potential downside being a dilution of flavors due to the higher yields to combat this we bled off a significant portion of juice costing us a great deal of money but making a significantly better wine the 2006 willamette valley pinot noir is one of the results of this superb growing season and strict winemaking regime
6597850 a very typical pale hue with a glint of green it has an attractive and expressive minerality steely yet with a presence of ripe white fruits wrapped around this harder core with a leafy nettly outer wrapping fine structure ripe fruits nicely rounded out but with a little backbone of grip and very decent acidity a little lacking in substance and character perhaps especially through the midpalate and the 2005 was undeniably superior but good and a worthy buy nevertheless
6597851 crisp clean and refreshing with lively and tangy flavors leaving you with a juicy mouthful of peaches and pears
6597852 2004 was a superb vintage in priorat and the three entries from alvaro palacios are stunning if i were a young wine enthusiast with limited discretionary income i would surely buy a case of the 2004 les terrasses it is a blend of 60 carignan 30 grenache and 10 cabernet sauvignon aged for one year in a combination of used french and american oak it is opaque purple in color with a knockout nose of kirsch blueberry licorice and minerals on the palate there are layers of sweet ripe black fruits a supple texture and light soft tannins to support several more years of bottle aging
6597853 far and away the best palliser pinot noir weve ever reviewed the 2005 boasts complex savory aromas and flavors that match ripe black cherry and plum fruit with peppery herbal notes and hints of smoke meat and brown sugar the creamy supple tannins are balanced by crisp acids and concentrated fruit on the long finish
6597854 french cuisine today isnt what it was fifty years ago
6597855 the activities are different but even the structure in kitchens is similar to the military chef sous chef staff sergeant sergeant theres never any confusion about hierarchy
6597856 upperline could be mistaken for a gallery spotlighting local artists
6597857 here is where dark rouxy gumbos find common ground with lemony gnocchi seared in olive oil where small plates of house made spaghetti come outfitted with fried poached eggs where parmesan beignets stand in for croutons on carefully composed spinach salads and steamy piles of dirty rice escort crisp confit duck legs in short herbsaint is where new orleans after almost three centuries of braising in european influences finally puts its definitive stamp on the bistro trattoria
6597858 i feel like the great things of life are only given to certain people i have a happy spirit but i still feel after some recent let downs like is this as good as it gets

6597865 its unfortunate that nas key west has been subjected to incompatible development near and around boca chica airfield such as the proposal before you today
6597866 please make no mistake that if there is continued unfettered encroachment of incompatible development near boca chica airfield the mission of nas key west will be negatively affected

6597868 its fucking over the top brian eschbach guitarist songwriter has really outdone himself this time the kid eats lightning and shits chains
6597869 weve never had such a sick rhythm section bart and shannon have really stepped up and added an extra punch to this beast of a record
6597870 basically we found ourselves at the end of the miasma touring cycle with no drummer and no new material it was a dark time for the band filled with a lot of anguish and doubt needless to say i am glad that it is so far behind us now
6597871 the drama and controversy that constantly surrounds this project has always been a fuel for us
6597872 the challenge and stress of refurbishing the line up while simultaneously preparing this record in such a short amount of time really shines through in the intensity level of the songs extreme conditions demand extreme responses so to speak
6597873 lyrically i believe nocturnal is our most evil outing yet it is a full return to the death gore lyrical style that helped establish us in the first place it is an ode to the great death metal records of past while also being our most original and inventive outing to date
6597874 i like neither new clothes nor new kinds of food
6597875 when it comes to energy consumers are much more cost conscious
6597876 control or lack of it is a highly emotional value tied to a core american value the freedom of choice and should be leveraged in messaging

6597905 the crisis is not over and im not exactly sure when its going to end there is still a tremendous amount of deleveraging still necessary
6597906 it was a massive failure of the brains of the economy there was a party going on and the regulator with the same mindset of those in the party didnt want to be a party pooper
6597907 as the crisis continues you will see a lot of business failures
6597908 the economy has really shown one sign after the other of weakening

6597923 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
6597924 solar power has always been a limited far off solution
6597925 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
6597926 what are the long term effects of collecting solar energy currently most solar energy is reflected back out to space but what happens when we start collecting it en masse that energy will no longer be escaping to space but staying here on earth wont it manifest as heat and therefore contribute to global warming
6597927 im between two phases right now pre iron man and post iron man and the transition can be tricky
6597928 it used to be id drive onto a studio lot and the guard was like less than zero dude i loved chaplin now its iron man its not an algorithm anymore its a fixed number things have been zeroed out its the beginning of something but right now its still a void and we tend to think of the void as an abyss or a vacuum with nothing there in fact its a new road and what you should do on this new road is close for repairs close right away because that old vehicle is not going to work on that new road i mean if the cosmos is a loving healing thing that also spins real fast and erupts and does violent stuff and if there really is some kind of order to the whole thing then everything thats led up to this moment has to be part of it or the math doesnt work but in this transition phase i really am trying to live as much like a lizard as i can hot rock sun fly tongue
6597929 the art is not in never failing but rising every time you fall
6597930 if you could be a gold medalist in any olympic event which event would it be

6597942 it chronicles a voyage of discovery and there is the undeniable use of geological science throughout
6597943 vernes characters go through their adventures rather stolidly the accent is placed on their learning rather than their feeling from this approach there has sprung the type of story known today as hard science fiction as opposed to the stories in which action or interaction outweighs knowledge or the discovery of knowledge alone the discovery is more important than development of character vernes people for all their physical participation in exciting action were at heart only spectator reporters while wells were subject to inner stress
6597944 these two very different approaches became a combined foundation in time later writers fused into one pattern both ways of handling futuristic and fantastic material the quests of verne were for the new men who might have been shaped by such knowledge two gifts appearing to differ were really complementary to each other

6598017 again unfortunately this is a koala thats been bashed to death and then after its death they removed its leg
6598018 everyone is very connected to this animal and it is a very emotional decision
6598019 it is a bit like if you have got a family pet when the vet says to you there is nothing more we can do and the animal is suffering then people obviously take different courses of action depending on their individual feelings

6598021 over the week we have had a number of people from a number of groups come up with some suggestions and we have hunted those down internationally talking to experts in san diego and around the world

6598025 within the segment the new falcon is doing very well but customers are changing their preferences and we are seeing a decline in large car sales overall
6598026 global economic factors are also contributing to a softening in the overall level of new car sales we are projecting

6598028 the original movie had a little more ironic humor and this one is a much tougher action film this one is bigger and better

6598083 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6598084 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6598128 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6598129 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6598130 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6598131 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6598132 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6598133 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6598134 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6598135 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6598136 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6598137 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6598138 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6598139 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights

6598154 though i guess that would make it difficult to shred a piano like she does which seems to be half the fun
6598155 she is reminiscent of some of the great women vocalists who shaped rock music in the late 60s and early 70s allisons emotional delivery is unique in todays music
6598156 ever wonder what it would have been like to listen to a gifted singer songwriter from saskatchewan in a small intimate hall before she became joni mitchell dont fret theres no need to turn back the clock check out allison crowe

6598163 nilac is the only course of its kind in australia which provides aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples with the competency and skills to work in a white mans legal environment
6598164 one of the interesting features of the course is that modules can be adapted from the syllabus to suit the needs of the organisation requesting it
6598165 in 2008 hreoc with funding support from the federal attorney generals department developed one such module on family violence prevention for paralegal education workers across australia
6598166 those who successfully completed the family violence training received a certificate which gave them credit towards the diploma
6598167 the course delivered in cape york was tailored to local needs and made into a working project which culminated in the development of handbooks for each of the community justice groups which participated in the training
6598168 the new national quality framework needs to be ambitious comprehensive and easy to understand said ms mckew
6598169 i hope parents operators educators and anyone with an interest in early childhood development will attend these consultations and give us their feedback on what they think the new framework should look like
6598170 the experience children have in their early years lays the foundation for how they learn and interact with others for the rest of their lives
6598171 that is why we all must be strongly committed to the national early childhood reform agenda to set consistent standards for one of our most important industries
6598172 we welcome this opportunity to work with the early childhood sector in nsw and the federal government to make sure we provide the best possible early learning environments for the children of nsw
6598173 any move to liberalise agricultural trade could help to address the global food shortage
6598174 australia recognises the challenges faced by agricultural producers in indonesia and will continue to provide capacity building to assist in developing its agriculture sector
6598175 i was happy to continue talks which have been on going particularly outlining the benefits to both countries
6598176 we see possible benefits for australian horticulture producers were also keen to encourage australian investment in the agriculture sector in indonesia something which dr pangestu and dr apriyantono told me was a very high priority for indonesia
6598177 we think there are opportunities in agribusiness industries for australian and indonesian producers to cooperate to export to the rest of the world and the regional trade agreement would give us a great advantage in world markets

6598311 abs capital partners informed us today that they are taking this action which is intended to bring their ownership below 25 of the company and which under u s department of education regulations is deemed to be a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department in order for apus to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in the federal student financial aid programs as we have previously disclosed we viewed it as inevitable that abs capital partners would go below the 25 level and now that they are taking this action we will be able to move forward with the required regulatory process that when completed will remove a regulatory hurdle that otherwise creates timing and execution constraints to certain future financings and acquisitions we may undertake we will formally notify the department of education of this distribution and the deemed change in ownership and control we expect that the departments formal review process will be completed by the end of september based on department regulations and consultation with the department we currently expect that apus will move back into provisional status with respect to participation in federal student financial aid programs while provisional status will mean certain enhanced regulatory reviews and processes at this time we do not expect it to have an impact on our business results since we moved off provisional status earlier this summer we received approval for several new degree programs including our education programs and we do not expect our current plans for growth will be affected by moving back to provisional status
6598312 the purpose of this limited distribution is simply to move our holdings below the 25 ownership threshold that the department of education uses to define a controlling shareholder we carefully considered the right time to conduct this transaction so as not to interfere with managements goals for the year including the recently announced approval of new education degrees and programs we felt it would be in the best interest of the company to proactively move below the departments controlling shareholder threshold so that this inevitable administrative process occurred at a time and in a manner that was least likely to interrupt the companys business plans we have no current plan for further distributions
6598313 the government regularly receives a variety of suggestions for new or different bank holidays

6598316 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6598317 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6598318 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6598319 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6598320 the laurel packinghouse is an important asset for this city but it is now showing its age

6598327 in all honesty they just have a bad name with the one rolling over and killing the girl the sister ship is in this marina
6598328 a lot of those boats got bought up and they are being chartered there are a lot of people coming down here that we dont know theyre partying and bringing friends that we dont know and causing a lot of problems in the marina
6598329 they have tried to clean themselves up its not like they are discharging but pollution goes out towards all those homes behind the marina and they phone the environment ministry and complain every year its been an on going problem
6598330 from the research we conducted including extensive review of other operations we were very pleased to find that we are able to accomplish the maintenance of existing service levels with fewer employees than initially expected

6598347 instead of stepping aside in deference to state sen alice palmer obama decided to fight her for the nomination
6598348 palmer had decided to run for congress and obama was tapped to run to replace her when palmer lost in the u s house primary she wanted to stay as a state senator obama said no he had every right to do so but he decided to fight her for the nomination instead of stepping aside in deference to her
6598349 the man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field but by clearing it

6598384 there are serious flaws in the nss and the approach it embodies but it is a document which offers all things to all readers while being strangely unable to provide much in the way of vision leadership and motivation or strategy in other words the nss refers to the uks core values human rights the rule of law legitimate and accountable government justice freedom tolerance and opportunity for all but these values are mentioned in a strangely passive and defensive way almost as if the most that should be done with these immense ideas is to protect them from marauding terrorists and criminals and of course to stop them being ruined by flood water saddest of all these values appear to constitute little more than the normality to which we are told the governments security strategy will enable us to return as soon as possible after some harm occurs

6598387 counter terrorism police disrupt 13 terror networks last year from april 2007 until march 2008 over 40 people were convicted of terrorist related offences as a result of metropolitan police investigations and sentences amounting to more than 600 years were imposed the police arrested 46 people in relation to terrorist investigations between the start of this year and may 31 and charged 10 although the report points out that some of the remainder have been cautioned detained pending an immigration investigation or dealt with under the mental health act
6598388 it is extremely difficult for the nationalist tradition to separate out what i might call peacetime britishness from unionist triumphalism just as many unionists find it difficult to separate irish patriotism from at least implied support for the ira i know this sounds piously balanced but i believe it to be the case
6598389 councillor robin newton the dup group leader said that on friday morning the strategic policy and resources committee will discuss the provision of hospitality for members of the armed forces following a homecoming parade to st annes cathedral
6598390 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6598391 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6598392 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6598393 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden
6598394 bombs threaten life and property as would more harmful devices not yet found in the possession of terrorists but that they might conceivably obtain
6598395 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6598396 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6598397 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6598398 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6598399 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients

6598418 the court has given the governor and department of pesticide regulation dpr a green light to do away with these rules
6598419 our top priority now is to urge them to do so immediately
6598420 winning in federal court represents a clear and total vindication for our claim that the voc regulations were unnecessary and without any merit
6598421 this sets the stage for the state to repeal its now irrelevant pesticide regulations

6598438 we have put all of our offices on highest alert theyre looking for anything suspicious and all staff has been quarantined as of right now
6598439 immediately upon learning of this federal and local law enforcement officials were notified
6598440 staffs were immediately transported to a local hospital hazmat is on the scene and is looking for more information

6598442 throughout the decade in a half in which susan bitter smith has been involved in politics her record has been consistently liberal on economic issues

6598465 allah has not made for any man two hearts in his one body
6598466 usually in people taking moderate doses of the drug you see some sort of mild acne but in severe cases it can ulcerate
6598467 the doses this man was taking were within the doses that are used among bodybuilders
6598468 there is probably a dose effect with the steroids but its also dependent on how the individual reacts
6598469 it is questionable whether he will be able to start building muscle mass again he may not be able to perform the exercises due to the scarring
6598470 its well documented that some individuals can experience severe acne
6598471 often this is just a transient problem most people wouldnt consider it a significant barrier to using anabolic steroids
6598472 boy what a night didnt know if i was going to make it on time today

6598475 and he hasnt had any setbacks so with all those things being said if he does have another good night hell be playing right field tomorrow night
6598476 i havent seen him in a long time but basically baseball shape baseball ready
6598477 just kind of talk to him and see where he is also mentally
6598478 he was a very good player for us for a while a very good player probably our best player for a period of time
6598479 i would like to see him get back to that level that would be a great great addition to us

6598482 it is my goal to create beauty in my paintings
6598483 i love to use bright vibrant colors to create a strong contrast of light and shadow my paintings attempt to capture an exact moment in time so the viewer feels as though he were present in the scene
6598484 to live with her work to spend time with a piece allows for a decided sensitivity to come through
6598485 the paintings are created on a wet surface with varying amounts of color melting together

6598500 one time there was a lion it really made me go faster
6598501 we really dont have the resources cycling is very difficult to develop in africa
6598502 with one soccer ball you can have 22 players to develop one cyclist you need a whole bicycle
6598503 getting bikes for riders and keeping them maintained with spare parts thats the challenge talent wise its limitless
6598504 this takes a step forward in two ways firstly the use of bone as well as skin and next is carrying out this operation on someone with a benign tumour
6598505 there will always be limitations to this the main one would be a societal constraint a lack of suitable donors
6598506 however there is certainly demand for this with the major area being for people with facial burns
6598507 this particular surgery is a way of giving back a life to a patient who has been horribly scarred by burns trauma or a tumour
6598508 it seems strange that when figures are bad they are also often late if we are to have any confidence in government figures we must know that they are fully independent late or inaccurate statistics only go to further undermine this governments credibility
6598509 few retailers will recognise this positive picture these ons figures suggest julys total sales values were up 3 8 per cent on a year ago well above the miserly 1 7 per cent shown by the brcs figures its hard to see what could produce the sales growth boost ons is reporting or its finding that smaller retailers are outperforming larger ones we respect the onss process but this report doesnt seem to reflect the current retail reality
6598510 does not effectively reflect sales by small and medium businesses
6598511 does not include businesses in sectors which have shown relatively strong growth in recent periods for example the internet only retailers of home entertainment and major food discount stores
6598512 i dont think there is a great risk of a major policy error but it probably does mean that it increases the chances of an error the bigger risk is it delays policy from becoming pre emptive
6598513 we dont even have a precise picture of the current state of the economy as a result controlling the economy has been likened to driving along a winding road looking only in the rear view mirror indeed its worse than that as we dont even have that good a view of where it has been in the past either it is as if the rear window is also a bit misted up
6598514 the conformity of the picture given by the distributive trades survey with other potential indicators of spending such as consumer confidence and the agents reports have led us to place less weight on the official data on retail spending for the present
6598515 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6598516 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6598517 this is a massive failure of duty what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6598518 it seems extraordinary that a private company should be entrusted with and then lose so much confidential data when criminal justice agencies are still unable to share computerised information between themselves
6598519 these are the same people mr flaherty mr baird mr clement who are responsible for what happened in walkerton who privatized ontarios propane inspection and they want to do something equivalent about food inspections which is at the core of what the government should do
6598520 this very conservative government does not understand what is at the core of the responsibility of a government in a society
6598521 another sign that decoupling has been gradually accepted as a valid view by the markets
6598522 what it means is that emerging markets will probably decouple more than most people believe
6598523 exports are much smaller than fixed asset spending but people think an export led slowdown will slow fixed asset spending quite sharply that would be the tail wagging the dog
6598524 it makes no sense to talk about decoupling in an era of globalisation
6598525 the economy is still robust the moderation in growth was mostly engineered by beijing in fear of inflation instead of being dragged by a weak external demand decoupling is in action here in china
6598526 german economy would be able to shrug off the financial crisis and the u s slowdown
6598527 in sintesi una strategia di intervento pubblico dovrebbe basarsi su una serie di passaggi molto semplici piuttosto che avere un ruolo in prima persona di gestore o operatore il pubblico dovrebbe preoccuparsi di definire le regole sostenere la domanda per esempio di soggetti deboli e pubbliche amministrazioni ed eventualmente co investire in quelle societ che possono operare da level playing field e volano per lo sviluppo del mercato

6598530 we called him the governor when he was a player thats what he was he was one of those guys who conducted himself that way he was physically gifted and talented but mentally he was a notch above because gene would always use you against you
6598531 that was the same way he operated as an executive
6598532 the situation in the academy is such that to refer to god in any serious way would bring the legitimacy of ones scholarship into question there seems to be a widespread assumption throughout much of our intellectual community that belief in god is based on all kinds of irrational immature needs and wishes whereas atheism or skepticism flows from a rational grown up non nonsense view of things as they really are
6598533 the reason theism is something that makes a persons work questionable is the fact that it is irrational
6598534 yes i think one or two of your ponds could actually support fish life but i would put you touch with a fishy expert to say for sure
6598535 you really dont seem to understand this is wilderness and it is easy to get all turned around because one brier patch and tree stand look just like the next one i am telling you we are going to get lost if we are not careful
6598536 we are not that far off the path the pond is back that way and if we can find the pond we will be fine i really want to see what is over that ridge
6598537 why the hell didnt you do this an hour ago when we first realized we were lost
6598538 oh cool maybe this will help us find our way out
6598539 that way the main path is about 100 feet that way
6598540 i found the pond i found the pond come look
6598541 chris this is wrong we are headed south north is that way
6598542 no there is no way see here are my machete marks on the trees this is the way we came in it has to be north
6598543 well then the compass lies cause that way is south
6598544 mom i know which way we came in and we made a left here at this tree so we need to go right and through that brier patch over there
6598545 yes son i believe we did how the hell did that happen
6598546 maybe it was a right and not a left come on lets try it again but bear to the right
6598547 yes that is what we will do we wont make any turns at all

6598552 this would not prevent very large powerful patent holders from rejecting offers
6598553 the language of the butler report was likewise comparatively understated
6598554 the conclusions reached by butlers review team were also less hostile than those of the senate select committee
6598555 lord butler expressed a number of concerns regarding the effectiveness of the intelligence validation components of the secret intelligence services management structure the
6598556 intelligence affects the nations interests through its effect on policy
6598557 on this point the united states should emulate the united kingdom where discussion of this issue has been more forthright by declaring once and for all that its intelligence services should not be part of public advocacy of policies still under debate
6598558 the proper relationship between intelligence gathering and policymaking sharply separates the two functions
6598559 skepticism and pessimism about vietnam were present chiefly among those officers who produced finished intelligence in the form of national intelligence estimates and in intelligence directorate then the ddi publications that is analysts in the office of national estimates one the office of economic research and reports and the south vietnam branch of the office of current intelligence oci such views were generally a bit less evident among officers of the north vietnam branch of oci
6598560 what was josef stalin thinking when he allied himself with adolf hitler for nearly two years at the beginning of world war ii what did stalin know about hitlers intentions to turn on him and when did he know it
6598561 collection and analysis which are supposed to work in tandem in fact work more properly in parallel
6598562 intelligence agencies are faced with the task of determining intelligence priorities a process known as threat assessment
6598563 battlefield commanders receive more specific documents entitled intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb
6598564 not in a strong evidential sense pointing exactly to the specific intelligence information that justifies these interpretations as a result it is not always easy for the commander to determine whether a particular interpretation has been compromised by new intelligence information without constant interaction with the intelligence analysts conversely security constraints may prevent the analyst from explaining exactly why a particular command decision might compromise existing intelligence gathering operations as a result most of the detailed intelligence analyses including alternative hypotheses and interpretations remain in the heads of intelligence officers who rely on individual communication skills to present their brief and keep the commander informed when the situation changes 21
6598565 the majority of intelligence that the united states produced was tailored timely and releasable to ifor the u s intelligence community consistently disseminated actionable intelligence without divulging sensitive sources and methods
6598566 in kosovo a us battlefield coordination element bce is an echelons above corps organization now called a battlefield coordination detachment bcd
6598567 the air component acc and land component lcc headquarters work hand in hand
6598568 the air component headquarters traditionally runs the air campaign its intelligence support structure focuses on developing fixed targets for air assets to service
6598569 foreign policy ought to take precedence over law enforcement when it comes to overseas operations the bulk of u s intelligence efforts overseas are devoted to traditional national security concerns as a result law enforcement must ordinarily be a secondary concern fbi and
6598570 at home law enforcement should have priority and the intelligence community should continue to face restraints in what it can do vis vis american citizens
6598571 during the cold war national security was a federal government monopoly to be sure private citizens and corporations were involved but there was a neat correspondence between the threat as defined and the federal governments national security machinery that was developed to meet that threat the war against terrorism and homeland security will be much less a federal government monopoly citizens of democracies and the economy are already suffering the inconvenience and higher business costs of much tighter security and tragically more ordinary citizens are likely to die from transnational terrorism
6598572 contrary to widespread impressions one problem with the clandestine services has been a lack of initiative brought about by a fear of retroactive discipline and a lack of high level support this must be rectified if the intelligence community is to continue to produce the human intelligence that will surely be needed in the future
6598573 this is not meant to preclude the service intelligence chiefs from carrying out those clandestine collection activities specifically related to the tactical needs of their military departmental customers or field commanders
6598574 as several former dcis have pointed out the clandestine services are also the dcis most important
6598575 the danger of politicization the potential for the intelligence community to distort information or judgment in order to please political authorities is real
6598576 intelligence collection priorities while reflecting both national interests and broader policy priorities need to be based on other considerations first there must be a demonstrated inadequacy of alternative sources except in rare circumstances the intelligence community does not need to confirm through intelligence what is already readily available
6598577 collection priorities must not only be those subjects that are policy relevant but also involve information that the intelligence community can best or uniquely ascertain
6598578 it should be possible to empower a committee composed of mid level officials or aides to senior officials from the intelligence and policymaking communities to convene regularly to determine and revise priorities
6598579 it is important that intelligence officers involved in articulating requirements represent both analysts and collectors including those from the clandestine side
6598580 ok this is third down cover 2 versus first and second down cover 2

6598582 the planned parenthood action fund is promising to spend 10 million this election cycle
6598583 these donations come even as planned parenthood is defending itself against a range of civil and criminal complaints in several states and critics charge that the organization is trying to buy influence in congress
6598584 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time accordingly the investigation has been closed
6598585 he just started swimming freestyle and backstroke and only stopped to slide belly first onto the tanks platform so he could be fed dozens of fried egg sandwiches

6598596 the invitation was issued in may and supported by the bega valley shire council bega cheese and both state and federal members
6598597 the governors personal secretary and chief of staff telephoned to inform us that our invitation was accepted and he commented on the strong level of support we had received which he said was quite unusual
6598598 with the equine influenza having such a dramatic effect on shows this year the governors presence at our show in january will be the welcome morale booster we all need not only for candelo but the whole of the bega valley will receive appropriate recognition for the tough times with the drought of the last few years
6598599 we will also be encouraging as many entries as we can possibly manage in all classes of competition
6598600 this is indeed a historic event for candelo and indeed for the whole bega valley
6598601 we hope that as many residents of bermagui cobargo quaama as possible will attend
6598602 it is a great opportunity to ask the candidates questions about their positions on any number of vital issues including the recent sharp increase in rates the appropriateness of proposed developments in the area the pace of population growth and the quality of public transportation health care and other community services
6598603 animal health is still one of the main responsibilities with the vet setting our programs on dealing with exotic diseases and also working on production issues such as herd fertility
6598604 and a major part of rlpbs work is now dealing with animal pests
6598605 historically of course it was the rabbit but now rabbits are not the issue they used to be however should a landowner need them their animal control officers still have rabbit control methods
6598606 the rlpb do a lot of contract word for national parks and wildlife on the control of foxes deer pigs and feral dogs
6598607 the board has a wild dog management that has proved very successful from the victorian border to sussex inlet and inland to the top of the escarpment
6598608 that hasnt been a problem for the local board but is an issue out west on the travelling stock routes
6598609 they are another responsibility in expense in maintaining them and the upkeep is always far more than any moneys made on stock fees so you are using rate money to benefit just a few people
6598610 this is only right as the weeds usually have escaped from town nurseries and gardens

6598612 but the stock was priced for ongoing perfection and we didnt get perfection
6598613 we are downgrading crm to a neutral rating and lowering our price target to 65 was 81 as we believe there is less upside in the business model
6598614 that has caused some concern about a slowdown in large deals
6598615 the business is changing because salesforce is becoming more strategic for larger buyers
6598616 this trend changes the timing for when the business comes in this doesnt mean there is less revenue just that its signed up later in the year
6598617 more than anything this setback was the result of a high valuation and high expectations
6598618 if the stock was not so pricey say closer to the low 50s then we probably would have just shrugged it off
6598619 the evidence charts unseen but potentially powerful structures whose layout and dynamics are only now coming clearer
6598620 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6598621 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6598622 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6598623 probably capable of producing at least a magnitude 6 quake
6598624 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6598625 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6598626 ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
6598627 my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
6598628 i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
6598629 i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
6598630 ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
6598631 i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it

6598641 if you are in the military and the enemy is attacking you are you really going to ask what makes this rifle work or are you just going to point the rifle and kill the enemy
6598642 you must stand for something or youll fall for everything
6598643 that was the second thing i ever auditioned for and the first thing i got
6598644 but we did have a little bit of a safety net
6598645 we gave our house to my dads twin brother just in case we wanted to come back
6598646 in the first week i got a national kmart commercial the second week i got an episode of cold case and then the next month i got a movie with william h macy called the wool cap that got me a sag screen actors guild nomination
6598647 a lot of changes are made a lot of scenes are taken out or done differently just because you havent gotten into your flow of directing yet or what you like on the set
6598648 the kind of person i am i love all the energy going on on the set and having fun so when the live audience comes im just having a blast
6598649 these terrorist networks are well embedded in some of these coun tries such as
6598650 there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from
6598651 but the fact is i think we could go in with much smaller numbers than we had to do in the past
6598652 were not going to get into house to house fighting in baghdad
6598653 he saddam has developed stocks of germs and toxins in sufficient quantities to kill the entire population of the earth multiple times
6598654 i think the victory will be rapid within about three weeks
6598655 we cannot keep our forces indef initely staged in the region
6598656 theres no doubt in my mind once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
6598657 its clear that the end is very much in sight
6598658 i remain confident that we will find weapons of mass destruction in
6598659 were either going to lose this thing or win this thing within the next several months
6598660 i still say setting a date for with drawal is chaos genocide and well be back because al qaeda will then suc ceed
6598661 id look in one room and see 50 or 60 white amway distributors talking sharing ideas networking
6598662 then id look in another room and only see five or six black people
6598663 the african american community is not as supportive of business as it could be
6598664 black businesses tend to be isolated from one another theres a basic lack of trust
6598665 we have an hispanic district in walkers point where you can find great restaurants clustered together but no district comprised of successful black owned business
6598666 none of the other ethnic festivals have these prob lems
6598667 the germans support german fest the irish support irish fest the gays support pride fest who steps up for african world fest white corporations why is that
6598668 its time for the black business com munity to call a time out
6598669 we need to just start over again and build a system to communicate and help each other to grow
6598670 networking is important for me but too often i find the attitude in my own com munity is what can you do for me
6598671 i think that a lot of people realtors builders and the general public are scared they know that real estate is an excellent long term investment but they have read so many bad reports lately that they dont know what to think any more and are scared of doing anything
6598672 i just simply sent him a message that he fully misinterpreted that word and i dont talk to anyone like that ever i deleted that rude comments on my profile of course because i surely dont deserve that he he sigh some people just drive me nuts

6598676 people have not had the opportunity to hear from the son when youre running for office and you want a seat you really should have made some sort of communication with the district that youre running in
6598677 i am truly honored to accept the nomination to replace my father emil jones jr who has served this 14th legislative district for the past 35 years
6598678 i myself have been a resident of the 14th legislative district for 30 years now ive been involved in various community organizations economic development is my strongest point
6598679 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6598680 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6598681 you shouldn t be paying them if they can t broadcast and react
6598682 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6598683 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6598684 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6598685 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6598686 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6598687 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6598688 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6598689 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6598690 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6598691 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6598692 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6598693 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6598694 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6598695 really what the students are asking for is a refund 1000 each
6598696 theyve made every attempt to deal with it but have only received a miserable response from management
6598697 obviously the students are upset and we sincerely apologise for that
6598698 when we found out the students were upset we stopped the work and will only be doing noisy work during the holidays from now on
6598699 even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains
6598700 hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6598701 to expect that with the background detailed in his file he would get through parole with a perfect response would be unrealistic

6598704 it was suffering extremely so weve had to make the very difficult decision
6598705 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege
6598706 it is no different to any other workplace there are requirements when an employee wants to undertake activities outside their employment that have the potential to bear upon their employment and they are required to get the approval of the employer to do that
6598707 that is the issue between us that we are resolving at the moment
6598708 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery
6598709 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
6598710 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6598711 mommy i have a job for you will you take the tag off of me shirt
6598712 well we can talk about what i did there after you come home from work today
6598713 well i dont really think that i can do that right now
6598714 and stack them as high as we can i want to find out if every person on earth was a penny and we stacked them all together how high they would be
6598715 if we know how high a hundred pennies would be we can figure out how many times we have to multiply that to equal the population of the world
6598716 anthony is in the top inch of over 6 000 miles of pennies thats what it means to be thirteenth in the world
6598717 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another

6598745 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defence aimed at russia
6598746 the purpose of missile defence is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
6598747 we are here to take up the fight against russia
6598748 contrary to the official version presented by prime minister tusk and the us state department the war in georgia played a key role in accelerating the polish american negotiations on the defence shield it is the war that has prompted tusk to give the go ahead for the signing of the agreement
6598749 the fact that the us ruled out this compromise proposal permits only one conclusion that the missile shield is directed first and foremost not against iran but against russia this is underlined by the fact that the other bases for the missile system are also located in border regions to russia for example alaska
6598750 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow is capable of launching following an american first strike
6598751 the missile system is therefore a crucial element in the attempt to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for the stationing of just ten interceptor missiles in poland but once the system is established their number could be easily increased
6598752 this article makes very clear the actual function of the missile system it is to guarantee the us the capacity to carry out nuclear war without the risk of a counter strike if this capacity can be achieved then it can be employed as a geopolitical argument in order to implement national interests
6598753 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent

6598759 to ending the occupation in iraq and bringing our troops home
6598760 the use of united states armed forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the united states
6598761 we will not cut off funding for the troops absolutely not let me remove all doubt in anyones mind as long as our troops are in harms way democrats will be there to support them
6598762 this is absolute nonsense in truth the history of the conflict is not over occupation and never has been it is over the fundamental right of israel to exist
6598763 israels qualitative military edge will be empirically assessed on an ongoing basis
6598764 ensuring the security of israel and the entire world demands that we do more to convince iran to give up its nuclear ambitions and cease its support for terrorist groups

6598778 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6598779 we have in this country a constitutional right for a defendant to have a public and open trial we have strong rights for the media and the public to see what is going on in our courts
6598780 idaho has very strong victims rights statues we recognize that its terribly important for the sensitivity of victims to be considered in the courtroom and the sentencing process even the parole process when people are being released from custody however none of those victims rights those statutes control the outcome and the conduct of a case
6598781 this is a dreadful dreadful case and a horrible set of allegations its probably among the worst 10 cases in the last 100 years in terms the abuse of children and those who have to sit and look at the evidence whether theyre trained police officers or whether theyre jurors drawn from the public nevertheless the question is what shall we do with this man and its important to follow the procedure and look at the evidence objectively
6598782 the independents are really struggling at my current cost versus my street price im selling fuel regular unleaded on every single credit card at cost i didnt go to college but i know you arent gonna make it on that
6598783 this is a good program it sounds like but why should we cover the cost
6598784 we figure the fumes from the underground storage tanks account for about 3 percent of the vocs in the treasure valley that doesnt sound like a lot but as a control measure thats a big one if we can get greater than 1 percent from one control measure thats doing pretty good
6598785 i would probably be bankrupt how would i supposed to sell gas at cost and cover those costs too
6598786 nothing else will work without the underpinning of the higher user fee gas tax
6598787 sen obama opposes new drilling he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real hes wrong and the american people know it new drilling has to be part of our energy solution when im president there will be a whole more like this not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts
6598788 this ban has been in effect and repeated on an annual basis since 1983 the quickest thing for congress to do is to do nothing the ban is an annual ban it expires every sept 30 you cant get a bill through congress in 60 days
6598789 an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6598790 despite the efforts of centre staff prolonged detention was having a detrimental effect on the welfare and behaviour of children whose fear and distress was strongly reflected in our childrens interviews
6598791 children should be detained only in exceptional circumstances and then only for the shortest time necessary length of cumulative detention should be clearly and accurately recorded
6598792 significant concerns remain particularly the lack of activity for detainees which is a failure that we have identified across the immigration detainee estate
6598793 even more worrying was the plight of children detained for increasing periods of time and with insufficient provision to meet their needs
6598794 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6598795 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system
6598796 those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes
6598797 yet again there is scathing criticism of the detention of children
6598798 how much more evidence does the government need of the harm detaining children causes before it puts a stop to it once and for all
6598799 the impact on their well being as evidenced by their fear and distress noted by inspectors is simply unacceptable and the legacy of this experience will last well beyond their period of incarceration
6598800 we call for an immediate end to the deplorable practice of detaining children which we believe can never be justified
6598801 uploading is no longer a chore im so spoiled with it now i dont know how i ever did without it

6598803 well mom it is because i am premium and you are not
6598804 premium members already have that designation under their headshot to force an issue such as this upon them is uncalled for in my humble opinion so much work has been done by some to create their pages with a theme that projects of them as a person to include color schemes to provide it as an option that i could understand

6598806 uploading is no longer a chore im so spoiled with it now i dont know how i ever did without it
6598807 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6598808 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6598809 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6598810 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6598811 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6598812 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6598813 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6598814 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6598815 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6598816 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6598817 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6598818 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6598819 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6598820 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6598821 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6598822 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6598823 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6598824 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6598825 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

6598828 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6598829 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6598830 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6598831 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6598832 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6598833 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6598834 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6598835 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6598836 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6598837 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6598838 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6598839 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6598840 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6598841 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6598842 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6598843 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6598844 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6598845 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6598846 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6598847 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6598848 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6598849 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6598850 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6598851 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6598852 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6598853 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6598854 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6598855 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6598856 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6598857 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6598858 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6598859 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6598860 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6598861 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6598862 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6598863 we had our first practice with him jack and it went well john li was even there helping out
6598864 i usually run through a couple sets a night at practice so im ready for anything

6598867 what difference does it make to the dead the orphans and the homeless whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy we must be the change we wish to see
6598868 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6598869 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6598870 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6598871 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6598872 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6598873 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6598874 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6598875 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6598876 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6598877 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6598878 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6598879 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6598880 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6598881 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6598882 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6598883 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6598884 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6598885 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6598886 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica

6598888 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6598889 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6598890 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6598891 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6598892 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6598893 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6598894 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6598895 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6598896 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6598897 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6598899 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6598900 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6598901 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6598902 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6598930 i havent seen him in a long time but basically baseball shape baseball ready
6598931 just kind of talk to him and see where he is also mentally
6598932 he was a very good player for us for a while a very good player probably our best player for a period of time
6598933 i would like to see him get back to that level that would be a great great addition to us

6598936 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6598937 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6598938 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6598939 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6598940 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
6598941 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

6598945 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6598946 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6598947 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6598948 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6598949 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6598950 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6598951 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6598952 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6598953 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6598954 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6598955 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6598956 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6598963 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6598964 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6598965 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6598966 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6598967 where would an openly gay or lesbian bisexual or transgender appointee or elected official make the most difference during the next administration
6598968 the first ever multi platform on air online news hub for the lgbt audience
6598969 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6598970 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6598971 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6598972 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6598973 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6598974 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6598975 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6598976 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6598977 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6598978 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6598979 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6598980 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6598981 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6598982 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6598983 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6598984 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6598985 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6598986 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6598987 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6598988 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6598989 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6598990 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6598991 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6598992 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6598993 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6598994 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6598995 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6598996 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6598997 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6598998 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6598999 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
6599000 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6599001 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
6599002 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6599003 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6599004 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6599005 we can make more money on mobile than we do on the desktop eventually
6599006 the launch of android is an important milestone in the industry

6599067 lenders have been lambasted from all sides the financial services authority has accused them of treating customers unfairly and not helping people through their difficulties and the citizens advice bureau accused them of aggressive behaviour and using court action as a first rather than last resort
6599068 if lenders had provided more affordable mortgage ppi policies that match my prices i suspect more people would be able to keep their homes although not all those struggling to make repayments have lost an income due to redundancy it is a key factor homeowners who lose their wage could wait up to nine months for any government help in meeting their mortgage payments as support has been delayed from six months if they had ppi they would receive back to day one payments and have their mortgage repayments met for up to a year
6599069 i worry far more families than this will be affected which is why lenders must act now and stop offering cover that is at least four times more expensive than mine
6599070 this cover wont solve everyones financial problems but it will at least help those who do face the threat of redundancy lenders have a duty of care to make this insurance affordable and easily accessible
6599071 the course is in response to a number of requests from potential clients who need introductory help with the internet as brokers need to look for more avenues to earn incomes as the credit crunch bites many are looking to their websites to drive more business and allow them to cross sell quickly and cheaply

6599074 all householders should be able to protect the payments they make and keep their home whether its those with mortgages or those with rent and buy agreements via housing associations insurers have traditionally offered this financial safety net to people meeting a certain criteria excluding people on lower incomes in social housing who are more financially vulnerable
6599075 british insurance is leading the way in designing comprehensive affordable products for those who most need them i hope this will encourage other insurers to follow suit and become more socially responsible we all have a duty of care to help everyone keep their homes in times of economic uncertainty
6599076 the breadth of cover and services on my policies are wider because i take less commission

6599080 i used to believe faith promise was an effort to raise funds for missionaries now i believe that faith promise is more an exercise of increasing my own trust in god when i ask god to provide something that i dont yet hold and then continue to watch and wait for him to provide it i believe it teaches me to trust him for everything it teaches me to keep my eyes on him and the work that he is doing around me
6599081 we dream that christs impact upon our own lives will result on his impact on the world

6599084 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6599085 the raw data suggest a two to three fold excess of schizophrenia in the cohort born in january 1968 whose mothers would have been in the second month of pregnancy in june 1967
6599086 the population of jerusalem would have been most stressed during the three days of bombardment on june 5 7
6599087 the hypothesis is that it may induce epigenetic changes but we didnt look at blood here

6599120 russia has its own interests in the region and nobody wants to destabilise the region
6599121 and i think according to this assessment it is of mutual interest of russia israel and pragmatic leaders of states in the region not to send this kind of long range missiles to syria
6599122 the program is meant to help provide continuity and stability by addressing any employee concerns created by the roche proposal
6599123 in general our employees remain committed to the very important work being done at genentech on behalf of people with serious and life threatening diseases
6599124 patients are given extremely low expectations theyre told theyre sick and not capable of overpowering it
6599125 were told that we have to not face life and thats not a life worth having

6599127 i dont claim to be an expert i claim to be someone who can pull the expertise out of someone else
6599128 we find that when we gain insight and we gain understanding we can be stable even when were depressed a certain stability happens when we learn how to deal with it and it leads to the right behavior the advantage is we understand something that few people ever will
6599129 whats happening is were seeing a real problem with kids in high school and middle school jumping over the fence its a place to do drugs and kids go down there to drink

6599131 being able to cross the creek really makes a lot of sense as far as the trail alignment goes and were trying to get past that point right now
6599132 we thought that people would enjoy having a neighborhood trail connecting the schools it would provide more direct access between the school and the neighborhood
6599133 the kids had a lot of fun with the washing machine
6599134 we had two hilarious 3 year old kids running around getting into everything they were really interested in the gold

6599143 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6599144 while this study shows some short term benefits of combined hormone therapy use on symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats and joint pain it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6599145 i recommend that women consult their doctors to talk about the risk and benefits of taking hormone therapy before commencing treatment

6599154 our study found that the fires in wtc 7 which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings caused an extraordinary event said lead investigator shyam sunder
6599155 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down he said
6599156 video and photographic evidence combined with detailed computer simulations show that neither explosives nor fuel oil fires played a role in the collapse of wtc 7
6599157 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down he said
6599158 this size blast would have produced an incredibly loud sound that was not recorded on videos of the collapse nor reported by witnesses
6599159 collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the building
6599160 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6599161 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6599162 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation

6599177 the presidency is about making difficult decision but neither barack obama or his vp have a day of executive experience
6599178 obama supports an environmental policy that requires higher gas prices over the long run

6599571 certainly consumers need to understand what a standard drink is
6599572 they need to know what those actual amounts are and they need to understand what equals one drink
6599573 theres a general misconception of what classic rum cocktails daiquiris especially really are
6599574 i actually had a heat lamp at one point and a tray of sand so that people could think they were on the beach but that was a bit too far
6599575 i was just so impressed with the overall standard and calibre of all the drinks across the competition
6599576 gone are the days where vodka reigns supreme now were looking at the intricacies of separate spirits the underlying flavours the underlying aromas and what we try to do is accentuate those nowadays
6599577 instead of using sugars were saying lets use honey or were doing things in house like making our own ginger ale so the drinks arent as processed and you get the natural flavor out of them
6599578 people are pleasantly surprised that they are getting cocktails they think are familiar but they end up having completely different tastes and they are good

6599583 i wanted to make the information in the hands of people who can start making new cocktails based on tradition
6599584 as bartending is again becoming a respected profession as it was back in the day its nice to have these
6599585 its based on actually a salad that a chef i used to work with used to make that had a honey black pepper citronette or honey pepper lemon dressing
6599586 are sure to quench your thirst spice up your staycation or simply help set the mood
6599587 we freeze all of our spirits use kold draft and hand cracked ice to shake and pour our drinks and freeze all of our glassware basically giving us the coldest cocktail around
6599588 to the best of my knowledge we are the only bar to follow an historical timeline perhaps it was the way we were putting drinks into context that helped us win the award
6599589 by using spirits infused with local ingredients like berries saffron and fresh tarragon in addition to the newly released absinthe one of only a few produced here in the u s people will be able to get daring with their cocktails
6599590 i start by considering flavors that work in classic dishes if ingredients and flavors complement each other in the kitchen chances are they will in a glass too
6599591 i used to want to just keep it all to myself but then i realized i could do a lot more good by sharing it with the world
6599592 since its revival absinthe has become the trendy new drink of the socialite crowd and bars devoted solely to the green libation have sprung up across the country

6599714 its his honour the vice president who is in charge
6599715 the presidents passing leaves the nation shell shocked and grief stricken
6599716 this is the most devastating crisis my appeal to zambians is to remain calm i am sad because there are many things that i needed to discuss with him

6599752 obama has made it clear that he wouldnt make any rash decisions he is going to listen to commanders on the ground hes not going to do anything that would put troops at risk hes not going to have any rush pullout even with his estimates saying having most of our combat troops out in 16 months i think hes going to be flexible on that if necessary
6599753 barack obama was one of the first people to speak the truth about afghanistan saying that the problem there really has to do with the problems across the border in pakistan people are starting to realize that now but barack obama has been honest about talking about what the challenges are in afghanistan
6599754 he had no weapons of mass destruction because hed complied with what what wed asked him to do and the un had asked him to do because he didnt want to get toppled he saw what we had done during the first gulf war which i was a part of we annihilated his army a hundred hours on the ground and we annihilated the third largest army in the world and they walked home those that survived where they a threat to us no and i think a lot of our problems in the current administration is we overestimate the threats of our enemies and the people that they describe as being our enemies
6599755 i was one of the three people in augusta county to vote for the libertarian candidate for president
6599756 the almost 5 000 americans that have been killed in the conflict thus far and the 30 000 that were wounded about a third of them really bad is a waste its a terrible waste john mccain should recognize that
6599757 when we go to war its because the politicians and diplomats have failed failed miserably because never is there a war where things work out good theres always a problem and i think somebody who has an aversion to war is better than somebody who wants wars

6599762 its important that we have a president who understands how to get our economy moving again and when you look at barack obama believes that we grow the economy by raising taxes and increasing government spending that is a formula for disaster barack obamas economic policies will drive the economy into recession we dont grow the economy by raising taxes and spending more on big government

6599764 stories are basically about people who are changed by some type of experience that theyre going through they have some type of goal theyre trying to reach the goal theyre opposed in the form of obstacles coming from an antagonist which
6599765 people expect certain things to happen as you go through a story at certain points and from that you get a picture a model of what a story would be we call it a paradigm and when you come up with a story idea if you start filtering it through that paradigm and what peoples expectations are for the nuts and bolts of what would be in a story you can really go a long way towards putting something together
6599766 so when people ask me where do you get your ideas i say its really a process its about the structure you can get your ideas from anywhere i get plenty of ideas from newspapers once you start filtering it through this model of what is a story all of the sudden you realize that you can have a story right there just by going through the process
6599767 the way the obscenity laws are written in virginia if i had a depiction of sexual acts in a romance novel that im working on and people thought it was obscene i could go to prison for it

6599769 its a complete travesty and miscarriage of justice but yes it could happen it could happen to you chris

6599938 there is no turning back from a future in which more of our energy resources are grown and harvested in a sensible way
6599939 that means agriculture is going to be right in the middle of the game
6599940 we cannot emphasise strongly enough that the possibility of ccs should not be used as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
6599941 our grant focuses on understanding genetic mechanisms underlying wood production and biomass accumulation in sunflower
6599942 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges

6599944 to make the uk a world leader in attracting investment in this sector and to avoid it slipping further down the index the government needs to consider creating tangible incentives for investors following the lead of germany and the ambition of china

6599950 anything you can use within a two hour time period is usually safe
6599951 if its going to be longer than that you need to pack a little cold packet

6599954 especially if you have a combo of mayonnaise and protein thats one of your most dangerous combos
6599955 wash your hands and make sure your surface is sanitary
6599956 also always use a clean utensil to put in say your mayonnaise jar
6599957 if you eat out of a little fruit cup then you let it sit for a few hours bacterias going to grow a lot faster because youve contaminated it

6599969 although pan governmental performance on waste reduction has been good some departments still lag behind and we are concerned that targets are not challenging enough
6599970 following their campaign to promote re use and recycling the government must now provide clear and consistent signals that waste reduction is a priority
6599971 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6599972 todays signing establishes a virtual joint centre for a series of projects that are very specific to the centres

6599985 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
6599986 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
6599987 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6599988 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6599989 it could go back for miles and miles and theres no real mechanism to stop it
6599990 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong

6599999 in the modern world of celebrity people know if they go out without their make up on there is probably going to be a picture of them
