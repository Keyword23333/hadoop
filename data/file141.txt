1410071 my research group has been exploring how to understand the internet and how to interpret network traffic so we realized that it was actually feasible to take a census
1410072 we worked out how to do that and were trying to understand the data weve collected
1410073 there are many purposes one could use this data for
1410074 understanding how ip addresses are used and allocated we can better understand how worms might spread
1410075 we have more than 4 billion ip addresses so less than one per person
1410076 i think users of the internet are starting to realize that this is a problem that theyre going to be facing soon my hope is that our data will help shed some light on this challenge
1410077 one of the application areas for my research is assistive technologyfor the blind for example there is an enormous amount of data that needs to be labeled for our grocery shopping aid to work we are developing a wearable computer with a camera that can lead a visually impaired user to a desired product in a grocery store by analyzing the video stream our paper describes a way that people who are looking to prove that they are humans and not computers can help label still shots from video streams in real time
1410078 the degree to which human beings could participate in the system as remote sighted guides ranges from none at all to virtually unlimited if no human user is involved in the loop only computer vision algorithms solve the identification problem but in principle if there were an unlimited number of humans in the loop all the video frames could be submitted to a soylent grid be solved immediately and sent back to the device to guide the user
1410079 you might be asked to click on the peanut butter jar or click the cheetos bag in an image
1410080 this would be one of the so called wheres waldo object detection tasks
1410081 our research on the personal shopper for the visually impaired called grozi is a big motivation for this project when we started the grozi project one of the students michele merler who is now working on a ph d at columbia university captured 45 minutes of video footage from the campus grocery store and then endured weeks of manually intensive labor drawing bounding boxes and identifying the 120 products we focused on this is work the soylent grid could do
1410082 getting this done is going to take an innovative collaboration between academia and industry calit2 could be uniquely instrumental in this project

1410108 the participants are now reviewing the agreement for final approval
1410109 this code of conduct would be one important step toward our shared goals of promoting freedom of expression and protecting the privacy of internet users around the world
1410110 i look forward to learning more about the details this agreement and whether it will adequately regulate american companies operating in internet restricting countries
1410111 while the code of conduct is being finalized i urge american internet companies operating in repressive countries to do everything possible to resist censorship and protect user privacy and freedom of expression especially with the olympics beginning in china later this week
1410112 we must ensure that american companies operating in repressive regimes protect fundamental human rights

1410148 freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom of conscience are not a thorn in the side of government disagreeing with your government is not unpatriotic and most certainly should not be a crime in any country especially a democracy
1410149 the government is trying to change the laws and indoctrinate the population
1410150 rctv and other stations are owned by some of venezuelas wealthiest families and began playing an overt political role
1410151 the chavez government has the legal right not to renew rctvs license
1410152 viewers in at least one oft cited survey expressed little concern about losing access to rctvs anti chavez news programs and instead complained about missing the stations soap operas and game shows like the venezuelan version of who wants to be a millionaire
1410153 you turn on any of the channels here and youll see that theres more freedom of expression enjoyed in venezuela than probably anywhere else in the world its the only place where they can go on television and talk about killing the president or saying the most derogatory and offensive things on a news hour
1410154 former ap correspondent in venezuela bart jones who dismisses the criticism of the rctv non renewal as the result of a web of misinformation
1410155 should not be seen as free speech martyrs radio tv and newspapers remain uncensored unfettered and unthreatened by the government most venezuelan media are still controlled by the old oligarchy and are staunchly anti chavez
1410156 one of only two broadcast networks that presented opposing views of president hugo chavezs rule
1410157 broadcasters like venezuelas radio caracas television use a limited public good the broadcast spectrum and must abide by long accepted public interest standard

1410194 we dont see many light geese in the fall but in the spring more than 50 000 light geese most of them snow and ross geese stop over in utah
1410195 in addition to providing hunters with a unique opportunity hunting light geese in the spring would reduce the agricultural damage the geese are doing
1410196 most of the damage is happening in box elder and millard counties where the geese are eating grain and alfalfa thats just starting to grow
1410197 most of the light geese are on the private land where the agricultural damage is occurring

1410316 da vinci provides a means to overcome both the challenges presented by advanced pathology and the surgical limitations of conventional laparoscopy it does this by providing surgeons with improved precision and dexterity coupled with advanced imaging which allows for the completion of complex minimally invasive procedures in a fashion analogous to open surgery
1410317 i can operate with greater precision and control which is especially valuable with more complex pathology such as enlarged uterine pathology pelvic adhesions or endometriosis
1410318 with da vinci i can discern the tissue planes more easily and perform more difficult dissections which enables me to offer minimally invasive surgery to more of my patients
1410319 robotic surgery is more intuitive to learn and perform compared to traditional laparoscopy which will allow more gyn surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgery for their patients
1410320 after youve become comfortable with the system operative times for the da vinci cases are comparable to that of open procedures and based upon recent data3 can even be faster than conventional laparoscopy
1410321 while more complex cases take longer i routinely perform a simple benign hysterectomy in 60 minutes
1410322 and with new robotic instruments being introduced specific to gyn applications da vinci hysterectomy and myomectomy removal of uterine fibroids procedures are becoming even easier and quicker to perform

1410377 non si pu vincere partendo sempre sesti felipe ha mostrato il vero potenziale della nostra macchina valencia far caldo e la ferrari in queste condizioni veloce
1410378 stiamo correndo da sei mesi ed bello rilassarsi per un po ricaricarsi e tornare a lottare di nuovo tra due settimane la nostra posizione in campionato non cos male ovviamente dobbiamo migliorare e lo faremo questo il nostro obiettivo il weekend in ungheria stato deludente per me ma dopo tutto il risultato stato abbastanza buono ci siamo avvicinati alla testa della classifica non si poteva fare meglio non posso negare che le ultime gare non sono andate come avrei voluto
1410379 ogni volta accaduto qualcosa di strano non sono riuscito a trovare il miglior assetto della macchina abbiamo provato a migliorare lassetto ma non ha funzionato lobiettivo principale ora risolvere le cose per la prossima gara di valencia le qualifiche in ungheria ci hanno di nuovo fatto male sono state il momento decisivo in negativo anche a budapest nel mio secondo tentativo in q3 non sono riuscito a tenere in pista la macchina stata colpa mia chiaro che non si pu vincere il campionato partendo ogni volta dalla sesta posizione puoi essere un secondo pi veloce degli altri ma se parti dalla sesta posizione a hockenheim o allhungaroring non puoi sfruttare la velocit che hai
1410380 felipe ha fatto davvero unottima gara ha aggiunto kimi abbiamo mostrato il nostro vero potenziale sfortunatamente si dovuto fermare quasi alla fine questa la parte pi dura delle gare anche a me successo un paio di volte di dovermi fermare per problemi meccanici quando ero in testa e stavo controllando la gara abbiamo la macchina migliore e tante carte da giocarci valencia mi sempre piaciuto molto andare in nuovi posti fin da quando ero piccolo e correvo con i kart imparavo molto in fretta i nuovi tracciati in ungheria faceva molto caldo e lo stesso sar a valencia come abbiamo visto domenica le alte temperature si addicono alla nostra macchina
1410381 started with anil kumble and filtered down to the rest
1410382 he has a tremendous work ethic and takes test cricket very seriously to motivate the team to improve their performance wasnt really difficult the great thing about his team is they do hurt a lot when they lose thats when one knows these guys take great pride in playing for india
1410383 i can sense the team is ready to make history if every member can perform at a reasonably good level we would have done enough
1410384 the success of any test side is how each batsman sticks to his own skill and works on one or two things that he can improve we certainly dont say sehwag plays like this so the rest of the batsmen need to play like this he plays like that since he has the skill and ability to play like that
1410385 im very impressed by what he has to offer he is a young bowler learning how to go about test cricket when he is bowling his natural length he is as good as anyone in the world
1410386 they have a proven history of that we have always believed that when this team is firing on all cylinders it can match best in the world

1410394 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
1410395 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
1410396 the last decade of this century has seen a very substantial increase in these contributions by developers facilitated by the significant increase in land values
1410397 the government s proposals for changes to s106 policy including the new community infrastructure levy will bring more sites into the frame for contributing to infrastructure because the levy will apply to all but householder applications and the smallest sites and thus these proposals have the capacity for further raising the funds available for infrastructure success will also depend on the continued capacity and capability of local planning authorities to set the levy and to negotiate s106 contributions as well as the continuing capacity of the development industry to fund these

1410564 brennan had the flashiest plays including a nice scramble that turned into a 5 yard touchdown pass to marcus mason but zorn said the rookie from hawaii made risky throws and is still coming to grips with the demanding tempo of the west coast offense
1410565 i thought colt brennan was the least of the quarterbacks who got the tempo up zorn said
1410566 what jim zorn is looking at is different from what you and i are looking at as fans the coaches go into a game and are looking at having the players make progress on some of the techniques and schemes that they are working on at practice colts progress will be measured by him making progress on some of the things that coach zorn has him working on like tempo footwork vision what to see how to read the defense the coaches are not looking for him to make big plays and touchdowns they are looking to see if he is coachable and to see if he is making the progress that they want him to make if colt is making touchdowns within the plan that is set for him by the coaches then he is doing well if colt is running around and making big plays like he did in college but not sticking with the coaches gameplan then he didnt have a good game we as fans will never know what zorns gameplan was so we will not know what kind of eveluation colt received from coach zorn it appears that all of the quarterbacks have a lot of work although colt wants to realize and experience success early he needs to be patient and understand that he needs to do what the coach tells him to do sometimes someone as gifted as colt is will automatically start doing things his own way because it worked before he needs to resist that temptation and do what the coach tells him to do the way the coach tells him how to do it he needs to work in the conscious incompetence quadrant for now and be patient until the coach gives him the green light to do his thing touchdowns and big plays will come later

1410629 the door is open they just need to step through it by suspending their enrichment of uranium
1410630 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1410631 its going to cost me quite a bit of time effort probably some extra cash to get my identity back
1410632 they even pointed out the fact that theyre no longer going after the suburbans or the tahoes because thats what border patrol is looking for
1410633 when asked how many victims he believes he has taken using this method said he believes they have stolen 50 cars
1410634 some of them may not have the means to return on their own to their country we will work with them we will work with the consular officials and make every effort to take care of their travel arrangements for them
1410635 at the end of the three weeks we will evaluate the program and see how successful it was
1410636 and its possible that we may extend it if need be
1410637 i know ice is trying to do everything it can to get people to voluntarily be deported
1410638 thats their program i do a little different but if they can give people a chance to go back to the country they came from i dont think theres anything wrong with that
1410639 i dont know if theyll enroll in the program but i think theyll leave
1410640 theyre not going to sign up for it they came over illegally theyre not working with the system why would they start working with the system all of a sudden
1410641 im not sure but i guess if i was given that sort of amnesty for 90 days i would definitely consider it
1410642 i dont think theyre going to sign up for this at all i think they risked it all to get here and will risk it all to stay
1410643 i think people would sign up given the opportunity to go peacefully is almost like a no brainer
1410644 theyre here illegally not paying taxes why would they enlist in something like that

1410655 well i was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment i opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face i thought i had nothing to lose so with my last ounce of strength i stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as i could

1410671 we hope that the cabinet will lead this but if they do not the time will come when a letter will have to be sent it is clear that gordon brown is the problem tactically now is the wrong time to force matters but i think many mps will return from their holidays with the necessary resolve
1410672 there is no letter at the moment a lot of names are being put into the public domain in an attempt by those close to the leadership to flush people out there are some black arts going on
1410673 i am absolutely convinced that gordon brown is the right man to be leading the labour party
1410674 i think there is a lot more that we need to do to get out and show to the public that we are doing we are acting
1410675 gordon brown is resolute and determined to do that the cabinet is behind him

1410681 for japanese cooks the hocho the japanese kitchen knife is the equivalent of the samurais sword the hocho is so much a symbol of a cook than in japan a cook is known as a knife wielder when a cook moves from one restaurant to another he takes his own hocho with him a chef gauges the skill of a new cook by examining his hocho to see where it was made and how it has been maintained
1410682 the cutting edge of the japanese sword has long been renowned as the sharpest in the world before japans borders were closed in the seventeenth century swords were one of the main items exported to china and southeast asia japanese swords are forged by a unique method of steel obtained from iron sand and melted in a specially designed forget before being patiently hammered high grade kitchen knives are handmade by the same process in the days when swords were commonly produced the same smith often made both swords and hocho

1410689 the question before us is who is appearing in the appeal is it the chinese name or the muslim name
1410690 there is no dispute as to the identity of the appellant there is no confusion because the appellant is the same person as the name stated in the appeal application
1410691 the right authority to determine her legal entity is the nrd based on her ic therefore the appellant must get approval from the nrd to change the muslim name to her chinese name which was rejected by the nrd
1410692 watershed is like a culmination of everything ive done theres a little bit of jazz a little country a little of the ing nue sound a little brazilian touch
1410693 it really feels like the way i hear music this mash up of genres and i think it reflects all the styles that have preceded this in my catalogue
1410694 i didnt really change much of anything as strange as it is
1410695 i didnt have any expectations as to what the show was going for do me or what i was going to do for the show i went into it as an opportunity to expose myself musically to a large audience and so my confidence level never really wavered and maybe thats what got misinterpreted as cocky and arrogant but i think maybe as the season went on he saw the work i was putting in not just to my own stuff but really to make it a positive working environment for everybody
1410696 ill probably end up putting out a rock record because i feel thats the kind of music that i enjoy playing
1410697 but that was the exciting thing about the show i loved knowing there were things i could do that people would never expect i could do im going to try to recreate that energy within this record i want people to feel they got taken on a trip from beginning to end ive got my work cut out for me but it should be fun
1410698 he really wanted me to audition with him and i was just hesitant
1410699 not for any negative association with the show i just didnt really see this as my path for whatever reason but 5 30 in the morning in omaha standing in line and its raining the sun hasnt come up and a producer comes by with a camera and interviews my brother and then turns to me i say im not auditioning and he says you are now life has a weird way of working itself out sometimes
1410700 for one thing their lyrics differ in style and content
1410701 the inspiration for this record really is my life in music and the characters that ive known in and throughout that life its also about how music helped me survive that life
1410702 i just wanted to stay myself and how i was at the beginning of the competition before all this happened
1410703 i wanted to keep who i was the normal teenage david
1410704 in interviews and stuff questions about my father started coming up and it was just kind of strange because there were really weird things
1410705 i heard he refused to give me water or something like that thats the weirdest thing i mean im 17 and if i want water im pretty sure i would just go get it anyway another thing was like he made me cry during one of the recording studios or something like that i cant remember really just weird things like that im old enough to have enough control over myself then the next thing is hes a great guy there isnt really anything hes done thats bad like the things that have been spoken about him my whole family has been such a great support and theyre the ones whove kept me grounded and allowed me to be who i am today no one understands what im here for more than they do
1410706 each week and as the weeks went on we had more songs each week to have to learn along with other things
1410707 with this final week it was the busiest of all it was hard to find time to even rehearse and stuff along with school and everything else going on so on that tuesday night i just tried to make sure i didnt regret anything i did and so i think i did that it was just such a relief to just feel good about what i did and the fact that that was the last impression i gave on the show the competition is all over and now its time to really focus on music
1410708 it was my main priority before this because i wasnt sure if i was going to be able to get anywhere with music but i was still hoping for something even if music does turn out to go somewhere for me you never know how long itll last so i just want to make sure i have something to back me up on that
1410709 i just want to thank them first of all just because it means more than anything to know that people are appreciating the hard work that we put into this
1410710 i want them to know that im just feeling great about it the fact that cook won i think he deserved it so much he just proved it week after week that he deserved to be the american idol even early in the competition hes such a great guy too i think we both gave it all we just poured it all onto that stage on tuesday night and we both feel really great about it

1410714 its because it was a song i wrote just as a birthday present for my younger brother when unwritten did that well it was really really exciting but i wasnt thinking about trying to please people with that song
1410715 this is the first time im headlining a us tour theres lots of dates today is the dress rehearsal day i guess they call that production day we try out all the lights and the whole set its going to be cool
1410716 my first album was definitely about independence and individuality and making the most of every moment
1410717 really ive done a lot of that in my life ive really experienced a lot and the next album is the next step up from that with the experiences that happened along the way
1410718 its about relationships the ups and downs and even just growing up theres some songs on the new album about when your parents try and tell you how your life should be youre like actually i just need your heart right now not your mind its very soulful music pop music with meaning really
1410719 it was really quite exciting to be backstage with all that tension of people wondering if theyre going to be in or out that week
1410720 im in the middle of my own crisis and now im watching all these haunting images on television of thousands of people suffering through a far more horrific event
1410721 and then something i never could have predicted happened it was like my song writing receiver got flipped into the on position everywhere i turned in conversations i overheard even in get well emails i was receiving song ideas started coming for several weeks id be working on two three songs simultaneously and these songs werent polite about their sudden presence either they insisted on being written

1410741 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1410742 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it

1410762 now we know brother obama but i tell you what if he comes to power come november and he doesnt start pulling troops out of afghanistan i know a lot of people who are gonna stand up and burn down every office of every senate
1410763 it was nothing out of the ordinary for a big show

1410776 started in l a with people thinking about the region
1410777 i was already working with caa as a producer and then i was offered the amazing resources of the agency the model that the agency works off of is something so novel and different for this market that it was a really interesting opportunity
1410778 our business is very much built on representation of talent we work with fantastic artists help them capitalize on opportunities that exist or that we create and we work with them on their careers our goal is to emulate the u s office in any way we can
1410779 we represent some clients who we feel have tremendous international potential and we work with them in that space but we also represent those who are totally local we have the resources to go either direction
1410780 at the initial stages we took a decision to focus on directors because directors were not represented in china we strongly believe that directors and writers lead to material and packages that create opportunities for all our clients
1410781 we find that because the marketplace in china is so new and growing and there are so many new players in the marketthat the concept of packaging is embraced
1410782 we are taking a lot of the strain off the financier
1410783 most companies in this area are management companies rather than agencies they are really producing movies for their clients we think that is a very difficult model to sustain because even the most prolific production companies are making four to five movies a year where we can package together 20 25 movies a year
1410784 we think that the china market is going to grow by 30 40 per year for many years to come

1410844 dan di waktu malam bangkitlah sembahyang tahajjud sebagai sembahyang tambahan bagi ibadatmu semoga allah membangkitkanmu di hari akhirat dengan kedudukan dan darjat yang terpuji
1410845 apabila seseorang dari kamu sembahyang malam kemudian bacaan menjadi asing bagi lidahnya kerana mengantuk hingga ia tidak tahu apa yang dibacakannya maka hendaklah ia tidur dulu
1410846 buatlah amalan amalan itu sekadar kuasamu kerana allah itu tidak jemu hingga kamu jemu
1410847 apakah yang paling dekat dengan diri kita di dunia ini
1410848 semua jawapan itu benar tetapi yang paling dekat dengan kita ialah mati sebab itu janji allah bahawa setiap yang bernyawa pasti akan mati surah ali imran 185
1410849 semua jawapan itu benar tetapi yang paling benar adalah masa lalu bagaimanapun kita apapun kenderaan kita tetap kita tidak akan dapat kembali ke masa yang lalu oleh sebab itu kita harus menjaga hari ini hari esok dan hari hari yang akan datang dengan perbuatan yang sesuai dengan ajaran agama
1410850 semua jawapan itu benar tapi yang besar sekali adalah hawa nafsu surah al araf 179 maka kita harus hati hati dengan nafsu kita jangan sampai nafsu kita membawa ke neraka
1410851 semua itu benar tapi yang paling berat adalah memegang amanah surah al azab 72 tumbuh tumbuhan binatang gunung dan malaikat semua tidak mampu ketika allah swt meminta mereka menjadi khalifah pemimpin di dunia ini tetapi manusia dengan sombongnya berebut rebut menyanggupi permintaan allah swt sehingga banyak manusia masuk ke neraka kerana gagal memegang amanah
1410852 semua jawaban kamu itu benar tapi yang paling ringan sekali didunia ini adalah meninggalkan solat
1410853 sepanjang aku menggali kubur untuk mencuri kain kafan aku telah melihat 7 perkara ganjil yang menimpa mayat mayat tersebut lantaran aku merasa sangat insaf atas perbuatanku yang sangat keji itu dan ingin sekali bertaubat
1410854 yang pertama aku lihat mayat yang pada siang harinya menghadap kiblat tetapi pabila aku menggali semula kuburnya pada waktu malam aku lihat wajahnya telahpun membelakangkan kiblat mengapa terjadi begitu wahai tuan guru
1410855 wahai anak muda mereka itulah golongan yang telah mensyirikkan allah s w t sewaktu hidupnya lantaran allah s w t menghinakan mereka dengan memalingkan wajah mereka dari mengadap kiblat bagi membezakan mereka daripada golongan muslim yang lain
1410856 golongan yang kedua aku lihat wajah mereka sangat elok semasa mereka dimasukkan ke dalam liang lahad tatkala malam hari ketika aku menggali kubur mereka ku lihat wajah mereka telahpun bertukar menjadi b bi mengapa begitu halnya wahai tuan guru
1410857 wahai anak muda mereka itulah golongan yang meremehkan dan meninggalkan solat sewaktu hidupnya sesungguhnya solat merupakan amalan yang pertama sekali dihisab jika sempurna solat maka sempurnalah amalan amalan kita yanglain
1410858 mereka itulah golongan yang gemar memakan harta yang haram wahai anak muda
1410859 wahai pemuda itulah golongan manusia yang derhaka kepada kedua ibu bapanya sewaktu hayatnya sesungguhnya allah s w t sama sekali tidak redha kepada manusia yang menderhakai ibubapanya
1410860 ku lihat ada pula mayat yang kukunya amat panjang hingga membelit belit seluruh tubuhnya dan keluar segala isi dari tubuh badannya
1410861 anak muda mereka itulah golongan yang gemar memutuskan silaturrahim semasa hidupnya mereka suka memulakan pertengkaran dan tidak bertegur sapa lebih daripada 3 hari bukankah rasulullah s a w pernah bersabda bahawa sesiapa yang tidak bertegur sapa melebihi 3 hari bukanlah termasuk dalam golongan umat baginda
1410862 wahai guru golongan yang keenam yang aku lihat sewaktu siangnya lahadnya kering kontang tatkala malam ketika aku menggali semula kubur itu ku lihat mayat tersebut terapung dan lahadnya dipenuhi air hitam yang amat busuk baunya
1410863 wahai pemuda itulah golongan yang memakan harta riba sewaktu hayatnya
1410864 wahai guru golongan yang terakhir yang aku lihat mayatnya sentiasa tersenyum dan berseri seri pula wajahnya mengapa demikian halnya wahai tuan guru

1410925 in argentina people dont necessarily support the left but they view the left with a certain degree of sympathy because they see them as people who sacrifice themselves for the oppressed
1410926 it was far safer to be in a union than to be an ordinary citizen in colombia last year
1410927 of the 87 convictions won in union cases since 2001 the judges found that 15 of the murders were related to common crime 10 to crimes of passion and 13 to membership in a guerrilla organization
1410928 there will always be winners and losers the best we can do for the losers is to mitigate their losses
1410929 for example in terms of veterinary vaccinations say that were functioning at 99 safety in other words laboratories are working with extremely high safety standards but instead of 99 they impose 99 9 of course were talking about arbitrary figures but the increase in technology is going to rob part of the profits they are making so you see how technical standards can also become a factor for imposing the price of multinationals and monopolies
1410930 colombia is an example of how the resistance against neoliberalism can be paralyzed by massive violations of human rights through persecuting social movement leaders to permit this model of violence and impunity as has occurred with the negotiation by the colombian government with the paramilitaries is a new model of impunity if we allow this model to be imposed in all of latin america it will constitute an essential element for imposing the ftaa in all of latin america

1410939 mr mcallister was appointed through fair and open competition by an independent panel we are not aware of any formal complaint about mr mcallisters role in relation to claims and complaints during his time as president of the law society of scotland and no evidence has been presented to us which would raise any questions over the decision of the selection panel
1410940 i am interested in what the witnesses have just said about the law society having nothing to do with the arrangements for handling negligence claims i have in front of me a memorandum in connection with the case of one of my constituents it was issued by mr mill on 5 july 2001
1410941 mr mills memo was written to the then president of the law society mr mcallister
1410942 regulation of the legal profession inquiry which was heavily restricted in content amp remit by the then convener christine grahame msp snp martin mcallister the then president of the law society of scotland made the following comments
1410943 we are open to change and want to make improvements it is proper that parliament is reviewing the checks and balances that operate but it is a fundamental right of citizens in a democracy that the legal profession is independent such a profession is a guarantor of the rights of citizens and in scotland we deserve no less
1410944 the point is that the organisation is changing we have made a number of changes in how we deal with complaints over the past 10 years i do not think that the committee would find it useful to go through a list of those but some key things are important in improving public perception one of which is greater lay involvement a second is the improvement in literature so that the public have a much better idea of how we deal with complaints we have brought with us our current revised leaflets
1410945 we did some rehearsals but then i found out it was six days a week for a couple of months

1410947 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject its very emotional and a very powerful song
1410948 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her
1410949 he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life he feels that their romance happened so fast and so publicly that a lot never really got said
1410950 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life

1410962 in september worden 108 gelede bussen geleverd en 31 stadsbussen die uitgerust zullen zijn om fietsen in te laden
1410963 er zijn in de eerste helft van juli drie klanten geweest die het oplaadpunt hebben gebruikt
1410964 er kunnen zes fietsen tegelijk worden opgeladen als er een accu vol is staat de volgende fiets al klaar om aangekoppeld te worden
1410965 de klanten van de albert heijn wonen waarschijnlijk in de buurt en laden hun fiets thuis op
1410966 speciaal voor fietsers die de hoogste eisen stellen aan de prestaties en onderhoud van hun bike heeft bo green een range smeer en protectieproducten met een zeer lange standtijd zelfs de zwaarste corrosietests wijzen uit dat de gel tot de maximale duur 350 uur van de test zijn werking behoudt terwijl bij de bestaande minerale vetten al na 3 uur corrosie optreedt een van de belangrijkste onderscheidende eigenschappen is dat de producten niet oplosbaar zijn in water ze spoelen niet weg drogen niet uit zijn bestand tegen weersinvloeden vuil chemicali n bacteri n zuren zout en blijven zitten en daarmee komen zowel fietsers als het milieu een stuk verder
1410967 het beschemt echt goed ja je mag mij als tevreden gebruiker citeren het is namelijk echt goede olie vooral in de winter heb ik gemerkt dat de olie erg goed beschermt tegen water en vuil en pekel en dat alles soepel blijft draaien het is wel belangrijk dat je eerst de oude traditionele olie goed verwijdert
1410968 wij merken vaak op dat mensen die kleding kopen bij ydu op zoek zijn naar kledingstukken die niet alleen mooi zijn maar ook draagbaar voor overdag en s nachts soms sexy en uniek en vaak moeten ze ook nog handig zijn om in te fietsen
1410969 met de eerste fietsende fashion show willen we een statement maken fietsen in het onvoorspelbare weer in nederland betekent niet noodzakelijkerwijs het dragen van plastic regenponchos en regenlaarzen het kan elegant en praktisch tegelijk zijn
1410970 fietsen op een bamboefiets is net zoals rondlopen met comfortabel paar schoenen
1410971 deze cijfers zijn nog maar het topje van de ijsberg want ongevallen met fietsers blijven ondergeregistreerd uit een onderzoek van het centrum duurzame ontwikkeling van de universiteit gent 2006 blijkt slechts een op vijf ernstig gewonde fietsers op te duiken in de statistieken
1410972 volgens minister dewael waren er in 2005 6396 ongevallen met fietsers volgens staatssecretaris schouppe 6290
1410973 de cijfers van de ongevallen met fietsers eindelijk eens de realiteit gaan weergeven en vooral de cijfers moeten betrouwbaar zijn
1410974 het kon toch echt niet langer door de beugel dat de werknemers van de nmbs en de post geen fietsvergoeding kregen als autonoom overheidsbedrijf hebben zij uiteraard een voorbeeldfunctie te vervullen vlaams minister voor mobiliteit van brempt moet het voorbeeld van de federale regering nu snel volgen en de fietsvergoeding voor de werknemers van de lijn opnemen in het beheerscontract
1410975 net als voor de federale ambtenaren moet deze indexatie van de fiscaal vrijgestelde fietsvergoeding nu snel gelden voor alle werknemers uit de priv sector hun fietsvergoeding werd tien jaar lang niet ge ndexeerd

1410978 binnen twee of drie jaar loopt alles vast ik snap niet dat de autoriteiten dit niet begrijpen er is geen geld voor de ontwikkeling van voorzieningen voor fietsers er zijn wel een hoop initiatieven en beloftes maar die lopen nergens op uit een vriendin van mij won twee jaar geleden een wedstrijd met een plan voor parkeerplaatsen voor fietsers maar later zei de stadsarchitect dat het na ef was om te denken dat er echt iets zou veranderen
1410979 het ergste is dat fietsen een lage status heeft in rusland is het nog steeds hoe duurder de auto hoe meer succes je hebt
1410980 toen ik eenmaal mijn verhaal had gedaan waren anderen ook bereid een getuigenis af te leggen dat moment besefte ik dat mensen gewoon een duwtje nodig hebben

1410995 there is no senator more liberal than bayh in any state more conservative than indiana
1410996 governance does not occur in a vacuum a senator has a goal of championing legislation in line with his ideology but he also has a goal of getting re elected bayh became somewhat liberal between the 108th and 109th congresses what happened between the 108th and 109th congresses bayh won re election by a landslide margin and perhaps recognized that he had a little bit more wiggle room to move from the right edge of the democratic party more toward the partys mainstream the only reason this might occur i would argue is that bayh is at heart a fairly progressive senator

1411061 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1411062 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1411063 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically
1411064 it sounds like that were not better off is what youre saying
1411065 i think we are better off overall if you look at the entire eight year period when you look at the millions of jobs that have been created the improvement in the economy et cetera what im trying to emphasize anderson that we are in a very serious challenge right now with a lot of americans very uncertain about their future and weve got to give them some comfort
1411066 the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1411067 see the powers that be then i had a similar situation at my work but they guy listend to me when i said
1411068 several thoughts were racing through my mind i had been caught was one of them yet at this point it wasnt that i was unwilling to go it was just clear that this was aarons moment i had missed mine his compassion had moved him to heroism while aaron seized his divine moment i was stuck in a moment i couldnt get out of

1411075 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1411076 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1411077 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts
1411078 that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1411079 its just an incredibly tough golf course from what i remember it requires all the shots
1411080 youve got to move the ball left to right right to left you need to hit it long you need to hit it straight you need to putt well these are just some of the most difficult greens ive ever seen so it takes absolutely everything
1411081 we just lost our first match and the first question mark rolfing of nbc sports asked me was how can you explain not making any birdies

1411085 were launching two additional cloud computing centers and one of them is going to be an extremely large cloud computing center the largest that weve launched to date
1411086 both new facilities are examples of how were investing hundreds of millions of dollars to create extremely efficient datacenters based on cloud technologies and our enterprise architecture which weve instantiated in other cloud computing efforts
1411087 from a consumer perspective looking at it from the different use cases that are coming about you see the growth of these huge web 2 0 applications out there as well as the emergence of a huge mobile user base these applications require large amounts of compute resources just to handle the number of users because with the web 2 0 phenomenon people are actually contributing content back to these sites
1411088 its not to say that everybody is going to be exactly like youtube but even with a bank a user consuming your service could be a person standing on the side of the street hitting the refresh button on their stock ticker or account balance or whatever
1411089 thats going to create huge demand on the systems that are running these applications so it isnt just about back end data processing we want to talk about supporting lots of different types of workloads both user based workloads and back end based workloads
1411090 the thing thats really compelling about the cloud model when its used either internally or externally is that there are levels of efficiency that one is able to get that you just cant get with conventional data centers over time even internal datacenters will migrate more and more to a cloud approach where they adopt cloud principles such as virtualization
1411091 the software in these cloud datacenters is composed of a number of our tivoli products including a request driven provisioning product we also use a lot of xen but were able to use other virtualization technologies such as vmware too
1411092 customers arent going to be ripping out datacenters and replacing them with cloud centers overnight this is going to be a gradual process
1411093 its going to be a hybrid model with both internal and external clouds
1411094 create s a new opportunity to shape the relationship between those who use it services and those who sell them
1411095 obviously there are the early adopters who are out there playing with it right now but most of the world is trying to figure out what to do with it what it means what the value to them is going to be
1411096 at share were trying to introduce the technology the options get people into that planning phase get them better able to understand what it is theyre talking about
1411097 the idea of bigger clouds that transcend an individual organizations boundaries and kind of go to this notion of true utility computing is probably still a little further out
1411098 right now were trying to bring the discussion into the share audience start to expose people to what its all about get them prepared for when the cios says i want my own cloud because she read about it in an airline magazine or something like that
1411099 the iphone is not intended to be used as a tethering device and we have no plans to offer separate tethering plans for it

1411104 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

1411106 silliness often has wisdom hidden just beneath the surface perhaps the love guru will also since myers laced his austin powers farce with a message about tolerance but if you cant accept silliness in the first place you are likely to be immune to wisdom too

1411108 humor mixed with spirituality can work if its done well but frankly speaking this was not a good attempt

1411243 everything changed some players were playing not in their positions and it is always difficult when you change everything
1411244 but it was difficult personally to see my team mates losing games
1411245 this season we will try to be wiser we will show everyone we are still the gunners and that we can win the title
1411246 we play to win everything and we will try to do it
1411247 i am very happy because i have not been playing for five months so it is great to be back here with all my mates
1411248 we have been getting better and better we are playing quite well at the moment and won on sunday against a good team in real madrid
1411249 we showed everyone that we can still play well even if we have lost some players
1411250 i think he can do it and will show everyone he can play very well
1411251 samir is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him
1411252 in the case we received an official offer we would carefully study it with udineses permission
1411253 the premier league is interesting for him and they are one of the best leagues in the world with the spanish and the italian ones
1411254 if martin oneill came to randy and said i need 30million for player x and the player would fit into what we are trying to do randy would have his cheque book out before martin could get past the players name
1411255 randy has told martin to get the players he wants and not worry about the money we all know we need more players we trust martin to know what the squad needs and to go and get the players
1411256 additionally he will be equally ready to fund the other players that martin says he needs randy has never said no to martin
1411257 randy is no roman abramovich but he does have a wallet and he will open it martin knows that randy has made it perfectly clear we do not have to sell a player to buy a player
1411258 he wants europe he wants winning football he wants entertainment for the fans
1411259 diego is a good keeper technically he is almost perfect and he is quite complete it is important for him to come in and do well and because if he does that it can only be good for the squad
1411260 it is always positive to have competition for places and it is no different for me hopefully diego will continue to play well and that will make me play well also because that will be good for the team
1411261 its all about improving little by little and hopefully i will get some more time on the pitch in our next game results now are not significant but the way we play is
1411262 the deal between benfica and atl tico is done the agreement between the two clubs has been reached benfica only have to negotiate with the player now
1411263 the player will travel to lisbon to talk to benfica and close the deal i do not know when that will be but it should be still today
1411264 no news on a new assistant we take our time with that
1411265 we hope to have someone in by the end of september but we never rush these things it is hard to replace good men
1411266 we have good coaches here i have no problems with that aspect of it
1411267 its a joy to be living in these most beautiful of days i had no shortage of offers this summer but i decided that i wanted to stay because my dream is to succeed here
1411268 i didnt have to think about it to hard belonging to this squad is a source of pride and i dont intend to pass up this opportunity
1411269 i have very good links with not just real madrid but also ac milan juventus and other top clubs a lot of the time in england people go for the same players you often have five or six managers watching the same player
1411270 open our eyes and work with the likes of real madrid ac milan and juventus we arent only looking in the uk we are lucky in that we have a reputation for doing things properly and we have been in sport a long time we know who our targets are and maybe dani is here with us for one year two years maybe forever we will see how well he does
1411271 spanish players are succeeding in english football and for me the only target is to succeed in our objective getting into the premier league
1411272 i was with the real madrid first team this weekend and all of their players advised me to use this year to learn as much as possible and to take this opportunity

1411632 u s is the best team in the world theres no question about it the talent they have and the way they play but the one thing about it is its just one game everybodys beatable on a given night so you got great teams like spain argentina us russia its going to be very tough so like i said everybodys beatable on a given night its not a seven game series nobody can beat the u s in a seven game series but we can definitely like our chances beating them one game
1411633 they were dominating and they were playing great last summer they were playing solid they got what they need to be olympic champions but i think playing in america is different than playing in the rest of the world because the american teams are pretty much nba oriented
1411634 they wanna to run they gonna shoot they dont want to play really really solid defense you got people who try to play this way i think its impossible to beat the nba players that way because its the way theyre really the best when you play these european teams its different they play much more like a block its really more difficult to get points its really difficult to get 100 points in a game its hard to run they play extremely physical so i think its going to be a little bit different maybe the u s will dominate because they can do it if theyre open but maybe they dont like its been happening at the last championships
1411635 after the 1992 u s olympic team in barcelona i think this is the best team ever for the u s many talented players in the group you know that when you face them in a tournament especially in a fiba tournament you try to go after their weaknesses as there are different rules in international play so hopefully for us we can find some weaknesses in the great group they have
1411636 its a lot more versatile the european game has a lot more mid range game with the 3 point line being closer and the defensive mind and the three second rule so its a lot more mid range and i think thats what they got when they put the team together starting with carmelo and lebron and kobe and all those guys i think they can be successful
1411637 they showed in las vegas during qualifications what theyve got with kobe now and lebron and carmelo and all those boys apparently they looked pretty sharp in vegas thats what i heard i didnt see any games but i guess thats the team to beat other than that theres argentina and spain looked pretty sharp at eurobasket there are a lot of talented teams and its going to be a fun olympics
1411638 my impression is that the last four or five years they dont make good work everybody expect this year they win olympic games its a great team with a lot of players and if they play together its going to be hard to win against them spain and argentina match up well i think five teams are closing but if the americans are completely a team its difficult
1411639 obviously the usa every year is going to be the clear cut favorite they have the best players in the world its a matter of if they come together and have the right group but theyll definitely be the favorites fibas much more team orientated as opposed to one on one basketball so i think when the team usa has to kind of adjust to that different style it takes them a couple games and i think once they adjust theyll still be the favorites i think usa might even have some cheers more over there as opposed to usually when the u s plays in europe they get booed and they get a pretty hostile crowd that wants to beat them i think the chinese really appreciate seeing an nba player so the fans there will be good to them
1411640 i think definitely the american team is the favorite they really have a great lineup they really have great guys on the team and theyre really motivated they really in my opinion will be the team to win but theres a few teams which will be very tough which are hard to beat like argentina like spain like greece those teams really can be great mention because on a certain night theres certain factor and those teams can beat the american team but still the american team is the favorite

1411736 were launching two additional cloud computing centers and one of them is going to be an extremely large cloud computing center the largest that weve launched to date
1411737 both new facilities are examples of how were investing hundreds of millions of dollars to create extremely efficient datacenters based on cloud technologies and our enterprise architecture which weve instantiated in other cloud computing efforts
1411738 from a consumer perspective looking at it from the different use cases that are coming about you see the growth of these huge web 2 0 applications out there as well as the emergence of a huge mobile user base these applications require large amounts of compute resources just to handle the number of users because with the web 2 0 phenomenon people are actually contributing content back to these sites
1411739 its not to say that everybody is going to be exactly like youtube but even with a bank a user consuming your service could be a person standing on the side of the street hitting the refresh button on their stock ticker or account balance or whatever
1411740 thats going to create huge demand on the systems that are running these applications so it isnt just about back end data processing we want to talk about supporting lots of different types of workloads both user based workloads and back end based workloads
1411741 the thing thats really compelling about the cloud model when its used either internally or externally is that there are levels of efficiency that one is able to get that you just cant get with conventional data centers over time even internal datacenters will migrate more and more to a cloud approach where they adopt cloud principles such as virtualization
1411742 the software in these cloud datacenters is composed of a number of our tivoli products including a request driven provisioning product we also use a lot of xen but were able to use other virtualization technologies such as vmware too
1411743 customers arent going to be ripping out datacenters and replacing them with cloud centers overnight this is going to be a gradual process
1411744 its going to be a hybrid model with both internal and external clouds
1411745 create s a new opportunity to shape the relationship between those who use it services and those who sell them

1411812 the city of champlain and laval a city of explorers and saints the cradle of evangelization in north america a eucharistic city which has hosted some weeks ago the 49th international eucharistic congress
1411813 the presence of the ark of the new covenant in our midst symbolizes the renewed eucharistic commitment we are invited to promote in the life of the church the great success of the congress was due to the prayer and involvement of many actors and benefactors among which i tell you sincerely the knights of columbus were the most committed organization at all levels
1411814 the love stemming from the eucharist is able to foster hope reconciliation and peace
1411815 as an international catholic fraternity the knights of columbus have a special role to play in witnessing the love of christ in todays world under the wise leadership of pope benedict the xvi

1411838 us and them and in the end its only you and me
1411839 i admire the jonas brothers because their songs speak to people theyre not just normal songs they have a meaning each song has a different story behind it and that is true music
1411840 i have complete faith in what captain anil kumble can do
1411841 there is a calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment
1411842 these players are aware what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of preparations the important thing is the awareness of the situation they know they have an opportunity to win the series
1411843 every guy is aware if he is not fully focused for the next test it could affect the teams performance
1411844 we were happy with the teams response as they lifted their performance by at least 20 percent in galle
1411845 no me lo s completo a lo mejor me puedo equivocar pero ah voy para aprenderlo
1411846 when the real estate sector was booming every morning the first thing i did was to think how much id earned now the first thing i do is think how much ive lost
1411847 im in a very awkward situation all i can do now is to rent rooms out for the money to pay bank loans
1411848 my strategy is very simple i always chose nice floors from some apartment buildings than picked up some houses from the floors i saved the houses and sold them after the prices went up
1411849 i didnt buy anything at the beginning of 2007 as house prices in shenzhen rose to a degree i couldnt understand but i couldnt help buying a house in june 2007 the decision was made only in a few seconds
1411850 i got the house for 11 000 yuan per square meter and its fallen to less than 7 000 yuan per square meter i lost at least 500 000 yuan
1411851 it became very hard to pay 6 000 yuan every month in bank loans every month
1411852 several investors bought the same building with me and weve rented our houses together to logistics companies to get some money
1411853 i have a sense that the winter has just began
1411854 the market performance in the first half of 2008 has been poorer than i expected
1411855 investing and speculating in the real estate market was rampant in 2007 leading to a serious imbalance in supply and demand
1411856 because the government implemented a series of macro control policies the speculative activities were reined in
1411857 the current situation is a combined result of many factors
1411858 the steady rise in housing prices has surpassed what home buyers can pay the current drops in the growth margin of housing prices are the inevitable adjustment of the market
1411859 i had been waiting for a calm day and last night seemed perfect
1411860 i paddled out and got past cromer pier then brought the oars in and got down on one knee
1411861 it was perfect miriam cried and said yes it was wonderful
1411862 i had bought a vintage diamond ring and it fitted miriam perfectly the sun was setting we even had a rainbow
1411863 then about 10 minutes later our plans were disrupted when a man on a fishing boat said the coastguard had been called and that he would take us ashore
1411864 i was dressed in a tweed waistcoat and bow tie said colin who works as a currency designer in london
1411865 i have quite a few friends in cromer and thought this is not what i want to be seen to be doing
1411866 there were a few cheers when we got back to the beach
1411867 instead of the normal garb they had evening wear on she said
1411868 it wasnt quite what they expected to find obviously congratulations are in order
1411869 my desire to wake people led me to write poetry centred on the important topics in life exploring those places that all of us find difficult to face
1411870 there are more important questions than whats on tv tonight we threw it out and now talk about life and death about love and sacrifice about war and freedom then we seek some answers to the questions that arise before life ends
1411871 we had great trouble choosing between the last two poems phuoc tan dieps portrait of death as an artist is a powerful evocation of the aftermath of war through the metaphor of death as a painter we are invited to reflect on how even long afterwards the melancholy aesthetics of death persist through still and spare language the pathos and loss of war are wonderfully evoked
1411872 as soon as i was made aware of this awful mistake i spoke to my colleagues and we agreed we had to put the matter right we are very keen to have good representation from people of all faiths and we hope this change shows how important this broader representation is to what we are seeking to do
1411873 this is a conference for anybody in norfolk amp waveney who is involved in chaplaincy whether lay or ordained voluntary or paid urban or rural anyone offering chaplaincy whether in the work place in health education the prison service or the courts emergency services retail port or industry or any other context will benefit from participating in this event
1411874 as chaplains we all offer a service to people of all faiths and none but how realistic is this how do we genuinely fulfil this pledge what help do we need to whom should we refer how do we demonstrate to those who seek or sponsor chaplaincy that we can deliver more and more organisations and companies we want to deliver chaplaincy to are asking questions about this aspect of our service it is not uncommon to have a company say we cant take a chaplain because if we have a christian chaplain we will then have to have a muslim hindu jewish chaplain too and thats not realistic for us so the question is how do we deliver a multi faith chaplaincy or one that can evidence good colaboration between the different faith groups
1411875 as long as there is a lower class i am in it as long as there is a criminal element i am of it as long as there is a soul in prison i am not free
1411876 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
1411877 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
1411878 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
1411879 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
1411880 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
1411881 this is about making sure that less is more and narrowing the curriculum down rather than making it a mile wide and an inch deep
1411882 sorting out the difference can take a great deal of class time that might be better spent on other ideas when students leave high school there are so many other things they need to know
1411883 you dont need to memorize all the steps of mitosis
1411884 what they did need to know is that genetic material is replicated and the same half goes into each daughter cell this was a turning point for me i always thought i was doing an excellent job
1411885 its human nature to be comfortable with what you know teachers must be able to step out of their comfort zone
1411886 they must be able to look at the evidence and re evaluate their thinking

1411893 the funny thing is that everyone thought that earlier one was a great book and then this goldman book appeared and people started really asking saying hmm
1411894 this new one was really a human filled book the other one it seemed like they had a thesis and they got the information to back it up

1411898 there has not been a single prosecution of a woman for making a false claim
1411899 this is an extremely worrying trend and one where proper action should be taken if some csa claimants are getting away with making false applications it will not only slow things down for other families but it also sends the wrong message about the things were willing to accept
1411900 i wouldnt say no good efforts our players were trying really hard and they wanted to win but we didnt play well
1411901 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1411902 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious its been done and resolved and we escaped this disaster
1411903 with regard to internet access there appears to have been last minute progress achieved
1411904 this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing were elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary

1411937 the scholarship program we started last year is extremely important to otterbox and this year we were fortunate enough to award two scholarships
1411938 not only does it allow us to give back to the community but it also encourages innovation and an entrepreneurial spirit characteristics that are vital to a companys success

1411946 regarding sin the prophet stressed the idolatry of the israelites which he compared to spiritual adultery israel had turned from yahweh to worship baal the canaanite god of fertility the lord told hosea to marry a woman who would prove to be unfaithful gomer to him so he could appreciate and communicate how the lord felt about his wifes israels unfaithfulness to him hosea called for repentance but he was not hopeful of a positive response because most of the people did not want to change gods judgment would therefore descend in the form of infertility military invasion and exile hosea stressed the fact that god was just in sending judgment on the israelites he would do it by making their punishments match their crimes the prophet assured the israelites that god would not abandon them completely after judgment would come salvation eventually the people would return to yahweh as hoseas wayward wife returned to him
1411947 they sacrificed to the baals and burned incense to images
1411948 my heart is changed within me all my compassion is aroused i will not carry out my fierce anger for i am god and not man the holy one among you i will not come in wrath

1411950 but they did not realize it was i who healed them
1411951 god taught israel to walk taking them by the arms but they did not realized it was i who healed them
1411952 i led them with cords of human kindness with ties of love i lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them
1411953 if we dont feel a sense of awe and fear and admiration for the infinite holiness of god which opposes evil with wrath and fury then all of our other feelings and thoughts will be defective at best

1411994 each night espn nba com and youtube are flooded with clips of players soaring through the air for rim rocking dunks buzzer beating three pointers and blocked shots that make your jaw drop in amazement while those are all entertaining plays teams who win championships need players who are willing to get a little dirty and do the little things needed to help their team win as valuable and crucial as these players are to their respective teams success these players rarely get the credit or respect that they deserve with that in mind the first annual hoops addict floor burn tournament will kick off this week
1411995 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year
1411996 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning

1412000 a penn quarter dining destination that exudes both contemporary chic and rustic warmth
1412001 when dr annie lim came to me with the idea and told me that she wanted to have this program as a community service i love it immediately this is a great way for us to give back to our community and especially to those who have paved the way for the current and new generations
1412002 we came up with program because we realized many older people would like to learn how to use the computer and browse the internet but dont know where to learn it is difficult for them to learn from their children even with my own experience my parents have been asking me to show them and most of time i have been telling them i am busy with work
1412003 our goal is to educate these individuals increase their knowledge and skills to improve communications among family members and friends and ultimately to improve the lifestyle of these individuals and perhaps they can even venture into some business in the internet
1412004 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland
1412005 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1412006 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1412007 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1412008 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1412009 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 iraq was subject to
1412010 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1412011 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1412012 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1412013 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1412014 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
1412015 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
1412016 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
1412017 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
1412018 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
1412019 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
1412020 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
1412021 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
1412022 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
1412023 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
1412024 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
1412025 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract
1412026 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort

1412028 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1412029 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate
1412030 cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1412031 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1412032 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1412063 i believe modesty goes far beyond clothing choices it is part of defining your character a modest woman is one who is secure in who she is in christ and doesnt need to dress in ways that attract attention honestly it isnt so much what you are wearing but the attitude with it
1412064 modesty is important for women because i would say that the more modest the woman the more attractive they actually are to men contrary to what most people think short clingy clothes do not make men attracted to them it arises feelings that arent just primarily attraction but lust and if i was a woman i would want people attracted to me for not only my looks but primarily my personality
1412065 i would want my wife to dress in such a way that she presented herself to be well kept and attractive i wouldnt want her to put on clothes that were too provocative and encouraged a barrage of male advancements but i wouldnt want her to wear a snowsuit either
1412066 an immodest woman is probably not someone i am interested in she is probably high maintenance most likely insecure and a handful

1412068 until now neither he nor his lawyer shahid karim have approached us for any assistance in securing visas for switzerland or otherwise if they do request us for assistance we will consider helping him
1412069 he is one of our valued players but since we have no jurisdiction in the ipl and they are communicating directly with him and his lawyer he was advised to handle things himself and fight his case but if he requires assistance and advise we have never said no to him
1412070 the pcb has provided him all help as allowed under our rules and regulations we have not ignored him but eventually ipl has its own anti doping regulations and committee and he has to fight his case himself

1412128 a coalition force would make a pact with essentially their enemy and promise not to go into their area so as not to get attacked
1412129 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1412130 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem

1412141 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1412142 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1412143 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1412144 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1412145 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1412146 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1412147 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species

1412151 while the u s oil industry wants access to more federal lands to help reduce reliance on foreign suppliers american based companies are shipping record amounts of gasoline and diesel fuel to other countries a record 1 6 million barrels a day in u s refined petroleum products were exported during the first four months of this year up 33 percent from 1 2 million barrels a day over the same period in 2007 shipments this february topped 1 8 million barrels a day for the first time during any month according to final numbers from the energy department the surge in exports appears to contradict the pleas from the u s oil industry and the bush administration for congress to open more offshore waters and alaskas arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling

1412175 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1412176 in the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
1412177 bush says offshore drilling could yield up to 18 billion barrels of oil over time although it would take years for production to start
1412178 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1412179 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1412180 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1412181 suggest that tropical cyclones are becoming more powerful with the most dramatic increase in the north atlantic
1412182 the increase is correlated with an increase in ocean temperature
1412183 a debate our italics concerning the nature of these increases
1412184 some studies attributing them to natural fluctuations and others suggesting climate change related to anthropogenic increases in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases
1412185 the question of whether we can ascribe a change in tropical cyclone intensity to anthropogenic climate change is still open
1412186 with some models showing an increase in the atlantic and others a decrease
1412187 during the second half of the little ice age when sea temperatures near puerto rico were a few degrees celsius cooler than today which provides some evidence that todays warmth is not needed for increased storminess
1412188 sedimentary ridges in australia left behind by ancient tropical cyclones indicate that activity from the last century under represents the continents stormy past
1412189 to distinguish changes in overall activity from changes in local activity due to shifts in storm tracks
1412190 to understand how climate influences local changes in tropical cyclone activity more research is needed to identify factors influencing tropical cyclone tracks

1412225 after spending time in nazareth visiting the sites of the annunciation and josephs house we went to megiddo an archaeological site which gave idea of life behind fortifications and believed to be the armageddon of revelation megiddo is on a hillside and gave us wonderful views of mount tabor the transfiguration mount carmel elijah proves baal is a false god and a magnificent view of nazareth in the distance the sun was hot and the mountains shimmered in the heat two thousand years were wiped from our minds as we traced old paths from the place where jesus grew up
1412226 it is impossible to turn the clock back but is it with the morning mist rising from the water we were transported back to the world of the fishermen disciples and in the silence did we see jesus walking towards us we certainly felt his presence we heard the familiar story of jesus calming the storm and even though there were no waves to calm we sense his peace stealing into our hearts

1412250 a survey of radial velocities in the zodiacal dust cloud
1412251 i have thoroughly enjoyed my years playing guitar and recording music with queen but its extremely gratifying to see the publication of my thesis
1412252 ive been fascinated with astronomy for years and i was happy to finally complete my ph d last year and record my studies of the zodiacal light in this book
1412253 basically its a man in a very colorful jumpsuit with something attached to a long pole going its swooping its swooping its coming around its coming down
1412254 at first when you are reacting to a traffic cone on a stick its a bit hilarious the hardest thing was not to laugh
1412255 it was a learning curve for all of us and there were a lot of giggles along the way
1412256 but now when you see new characters come to the show and you see those actors struggle with it you realize how its become part of your life so i dont find it tough any more
1412257 it gave me a skill set where you say well what else can this do
1412258 if you obey the rules and design a creature based on biology or something that did exist then people go oooh that looks real
1412259 its a fantastic relief not to have to worry about the length of their teeth and the size of nostril hair
1412260 so i could add an extra sabre tooth to the gorgonopsid and no one cared because this is drama
1412261 when effects step out of the background and become an active participant among the characters that changes the dynamic alters the drama that gives you something audiences hadnt seen before
1412262 if you look at space operas they show flying machines and occasionally people walk on in a pair of rubber ears personally i think the age of rubber ears is over what you need to do is to produce believable digital characters
1412263 its like all hamstrings weve got to give it a little time to rest

1412267 hopefully rest will be enough and well find out in the next couple of weeks

1412273 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1412274 for once i am gobsmacked by this generosity i cant thank them enough after everything we have been through i was devastated but this has completely restored my faith in people
1412275 we went to see the solicitors for more legal advice because we intend to continue our fight against the pct and when i got there they told me it was a total bolt from the blue and i still cant quite believe it it is like a huge weight has been lifted off me
1412276 we are overwhelmed by this generosity we cannot thank them enough for giving us back some hope
1412277 we should not have to rely on a stranger to provide care which should be available on the nhs but they have done something amazing
1412278 throughout this experience we have had really good support from everyone else throughout this campaign our solicitor members of the public and the m e n we would like to thank them all
1412279 we are currently liaising with prof hawkins to arrange to start the course of treatment as soon as possible

1412389 hi im ted i live down the street im passing around a petition to have the city install sidewalks
1412390 i thought she was out west and wasnt able to return any money
1412391 this is a petition to have her come back here to put them in herself
1412392 sure it will once she gets here she can start digging apparently she majored in construction so she should know how to do it
1412393 but she doesnt have any of the materials or equipment
1412394 violet we understand that the money you used for college was supposed to go to sidewalk construction
1412395 i didnt know that it was for sidewalks i thought it was for me to expand my mind thats what youre supposed to do in college you know
1412396 but surely miss violet moonbeam you did something with that money what did you study in college
1412397 i started out studying civil engineering but then transferred my major to psychology i didnt like that so i changed it again to english
1412398 oh so you had some civil engineering thats good news
1412399 well miss violent moonbeam youre still responsible for the sidewalks
1412400 im sorry your honor but what name did you just call me
1412401 no my name is moonbeam i was violet back before i achieved cognizance but when i came aware the deep purple of my life grew to glow in such an intense fashion that it was best described as a moonbeam
1412402 i can see that this town doesnt have any heart and that the sunny side of the street is dark it is void it is empty it has the tang of anarchy the anarchy you all fear it is violent and for me to persevere i will become violent moonbeam
1412403 true or false judges should arrive 30 minutes before the polls open to set up the precinct for the days activities anyone
1412404 in our polling place during the last election we all got there 90 minutes before the polls opened but there was no one to let us in so we had to wait outside for an hour my hair was wet and it froze to my ears
1412405 according to the judge of election handbook which was approved by both the county board and state legislator judges are to arrive at the polling place thirty minutes before the polls open this means since the polls open at 6 a m you have to be there at 5 30 so you can help set up the equipment put up all the signs and decide whos working at each of the five stations its also important to note that if the polling place isnt available to you at 5 30 like if the door is locked or the floor is covered in disgusting chemicals like molasses then you need to call the election commission
1412406 but what if it isnt a disgusting liquid but rather something kind of clean like sand we had a problem in the last election because our polling place had sand on the floor
1412407 is it okay if the pollwatchers bring in doughnuts and coffee but not share them with the election judges
1412408 the pollwatchers are there simply to make sure that the polling place operates as specified by law they have the right to observe all voting procedures and can be in the polling place from when it opens until all the judges leave
1412409 the pollwatchers do have the right to bring in any food or drink for their own purposes unless it is prohibited by the owner of the polling place or if it interferes with voting
1412410 so if the judges decide that its interfering in the polling place the pollwatchers have to remove the food
1412411 but what if the food causes a judge to have a severe allergy
1412412 well a severe allergy might be something that would interfere with voting depending upon what happens if the person simply has their eyes water or maybe get the sniffles then it wouldnt be considered a problem
1412413 incontinence might be a valid reason but ive never heard of that being an issue before all of our polling places are required to provide bathroom facilities
1412414 i understand that the judges are the final authority on deciding who can vote ive heard that other polling places actually gave dogs the right to vote can we do that here
1412415 yeah thats the way they do it at wal mart
1412416 election judges do have the authority within reason to decide who can and can not vote
1412417 they still have to abide by all of the state statues which do indicate that only humans can be franchised as voters
1412418 this is robert i think he should be able to vote he sleeps with me at night
1412419 im sorry but its not possible for your dog to vote maam
1412420 but if the other judges agree then it would be okay wouldnt it dont the judges have the right to decide who votes
1412421 the right to vote is limited to people dogs cant vote
1412422 once youre appointed to be a judge then youre a judge for the whole two year term
1412423 yes once you have completed the course you are officially appointed as a judge within the county along with all of the rights and responsibilities of the judgeship in which you are appointed with
1412424 what if you also happen to be a public notary
1412425 so once i have been appointed as a judge of election i can then also be eligible for appointments to other judgeships
1412426 yes thats correct if you have sufficient education and skills you could also serve in variety of other judgeships once appointed
1412427 if you have experience in the traffic court yes you could be appointed to a traffic judgeship
1412428 what if i want to be a new kind of judge like a judge that goes out and determines if someones lawn is properly mowed
1412429 landscape judgeships are usually awarded by municipalities but we do have two slots theyre currently occupied
1412430 but what if i just want to do it on a volunteer basis
1412431 ive been thinking of ways that you can make money
1412432 im doing fine on money mom i have a gig downtown where im migrating data from a legacy system into windows it pays great and ill be there for at least three more months
1412433 i know the train rides take a lot of time and youll never make any money working for anyone else
1412434 i know but it pays the bills today im happy with it why what did you have in mind
1412435 home inspections you could get a computer take a class at the community college and youd be set lots of people want to have their homes inspected
1412436 i dont thats just for people who are buying a home mom in case you havent noticed not too many people are doing that these days
1412437 it would be such a nice career you could wear a tie
1412438 no i cant wear a tie that causes me to be sterile besides i have a better idea
1412439 im going to start a garden out in the garage
1412440 a garden in the garage hows that going to make you any money
1412441 id sell what i grow mom farmers do it all the time
1412442 youre going to be a farmer what could you grow in the garage that you could sell
1412443 christopher you cant grow marijuana in your garage its illegal
1412444 christopher if everyone is voting democratic does that mean you have to as well
1412445 but mom the profits would be through the roof its a great way to make money you should try it in fact i remember reading something the other day on how the elderly have taken over the hydroponic reefer market youd make a killing down there
1412446 thats horrible what on earth did i do to deserve a son like you
1412447 you smoked during pregnancy mom im still dealing with that
1412448 well im still seeing tom he has a really nice boat we went out on the harbor yesterday
1412449 no we went with the rosenbaums we had a lovely time i packed a picnic lunch with deviled eggs theyre kosher you know
1412450 it was but when ralph found out he got jealous
1412451 no that was ted ralph is the one whos been handling my gardening
1412452 see there you go ralph could help you with your hydroponic setup
1412453 no he wouldnt be good for that hes not dependable just last week i asked him to take care of the gophers do you know what that man did he spent hours catching them with a stick and a rope in the rain
1412454 he got a bunch of chiggers too but thats not the worse part he wanted me to eat them he said they were great in a coconut milk curry
1412455 hmm probably tasted like chicken you know the teenaged kid has always said that chicken is the default meat everything tastes like it
1412456 yes i know so poor ralph should have made gopher cacciatore would that have been better
1412457 well i guess chianti does go with curry at least a red curry
1412458 i cant believe that man expected me to eat gophers
1412459 ive seen the things you eat mom so how was the gopher
1412460 oh i couldnt touch it but i couldnt let him know that i had to distract him by nibbling on his ear and telling him i wasnt hungry for gopher
1412461 anyway ralph would never do for anything as complicated as that hydroreefer garden business you keep babbling about he would get too caught up in the details and it would take too long
1412462 well if i was going to do that i might as well turn a profit the money these days is in making meth but the problem is getting the ephedrine if it wasnt for that he could cook in the shed out back with no one the wiser
1412463 they are petty big kind of like an extension of ourselves and look what they do they shoot out snow and the bigger the blower the more you can shoot
1412464 i dont like that i dont like that at all ive got to finish this driveway
1412465 the administration is not unaware that most of the student body says no to illegal drugs however there have been numerous media messages saying that not just a few students who body spray are utilizing it in such a way as to make themselves immune to detection by a drug sniffing dog we have taken the not simple steps today to demonstrate to the student body in no uncertain terms that body spray does not serve to distract canine officers
1412466 damn theres a lot of body spray around here and someone has chicken
1412467 okay officer you can make another searching pass for contraband
1412468 i dont know kind of an earthly sense like out in the woods or something
1412469 no not like that more of the urgent combination of man and beast like we were one against nature
1412470 yeah thats closer mountain men are cool they lived for months in the mountains harvesting beaver
1412471 well im not so sure it was that good remember there was that economic crash of fashion in the
1412472 oh yeah back in the day when belts were uncouth and all men wore hats and suspenders those hats went out of fashion around that time
1412473 we have it so easy now we can wear what we want to like jeans or argyle socks
1412474 thats not always such a good thing your toolbelt totally makes your butt look big
1412475 youre back to the horses again so if it isnt like a mountain man then what is it
1412476 more primal then that kind of like when people were only animals themselves living in the proverbial garden of eden before the knowledge of sophistication sullied our innocent psyche
1412477 you really think it was a knowledge of sophistication that banished us from the garden i always thought it was our intellectual ascension that caused us to wander from that idyllic life in paradise
1412478 well our initial phase of existence in the garden was based upon our basic needs you know kind of like what freud was talking about when he referred to the pleasure principle
1412479 no it was freud he said that the moment that we recognized that our lives were not merely bound by the pleasure principle we left the garden thats when we became slaves to the pain principle by entasking ourselves to making our lives better and wearing neckties
1412480 no but he would if he was here today its obvious
1412481 well i know whats what you need you need a yurt
1412482 its a felt tent used by nomads on the steppes of asia
1412483 those nomads live with their horses if you had a yurt you could set it up in your back yard and imagine that you were a nomad living at the edge of civilization youd sit back on the floor which would be piled with rugs and pillows sipping fermented mares milk while you sharpen your steel for tomorrows battle your woman would be over in the corner pre chewing flank steaks that would be your dinner and your children would all be outside playing with your herd and drawing their art in the dust it would be glorious
1412484 hmm that might work but id still need a horse but now i think its got to be a mare
1412485 you have to be careful horses can get sick also it might bother your wife
1412486 no that wouldnt bother her it would actually help me solve a problem
1412487 i dont know what to get my wife for christmas id get her a horse but shes already got that segway
1412488 well you know that they make ropes from horses id get her one of those
1412489 thats cruel how can you make a rope from a horse youd kill a horse just to make a rope
1412490 its a warning horn you know kind of like the ones they use for warning people about lightning strikes
1412491 coyotes thats a problem i didnt know we had coyotes around here
1412492 yeah theyre a big problem they come from over there
1412493 parents are worried that theyre gonna snatch their kids during a soccer game
1412494 oh so will it work on other animals like dogs
1412495 it only works on wild dogs something to do with the way their brains generate electricity or something im not sure on how it works it was invented in australia where they use it to detect dingoes
1412496 i guess not why do we have bobcats round here
1412497 sure i just saw one the other day theyre called felinis concoctipus theyre pretty vicious but they only hunt small animals like rabbits and aldermen theyve always lived around here unlike the coyotes which are alien to the area
1412498 oh well tell them that back in the wildlife control office
1412499 well i believe in a republican form of government so yes i guess you could say that im a republican
1412500 the senator can become unstable in their presence it has something to do with his time in the embassy
1412501 i just have a few ficuses and philadendrons nothing fancy like jasmine i also have a couple of dogs and a cat if thats a problem
1412502 i dont know who im voting for senator i havent made my mind up yet
1412503 do you have any questions for me about any issues
1412504 actually yes i do have a question for you im pretty concerned about the proper distribution of capital to citizens and how it will be handled by the anticipated socialist dictatorship how would go about that if you were president
1412505 i understand how important that issue is to you the management of money is an important issue for all americans when i was in
1412506 not really he just showed up one day and has stuck around since
1412507 when i was being held hostage in iran a kitten befriended me his tenaciousness inspired me to escape what other issues do you have
1412508 well i do have a pressing domestic issue it involves waste management
1412509 well im sure i could help you with that what is it
1412510 i understand how issues like yours would be important to all americans my escape from the terrorists in iran was aided by the fact that i told them i was simply changing my kittys litterbox
1412511 it would be good for three or four poll points
1412512 assuming that are our explanation is correct this is the first time weve seen anything like this ever in the sky
1412513 weve never seen a galaxy we could point at and say that galaxy used to be active and is no longer
1412514 this would be some kind of pointer to the possibility that there is more local black hole growth than we might have estimated originally
1412515 this objects been in the archive for decades its on the plates from old surveys but no one ever looked at it

1412518 one of the elements that make zooms social network uniquely valuable to marketers is the dwell time
1412519 patrons are generally at these establishments for up to 2 hours which allows for longer form communications multiple messages and more creative forms of ads than can be accommodated in an environment with lower dwell times
1412520 one of the elements that make zooms social network uniquely valuable to marketers is the dwell time

1412524 this is the first time that anybody has provided a vehicle for other ad networks to get exposure to messaging traffic available for ad insertion the idea of what we are trying to do here is expose all of the inventory that is eligible from our clients and make that available to a variety of other ad networks
1412525 so they are not just being bombarded with aimless types of advertising

1412529 theyre seeing bioblend as a natural expansion of their petroleum product lines
1412530 and most importantly theyre getting the products into the hands of their customers which is where the high performance and environmental benefits are recognized
1412531 weve always been on the leading edge of alternative fuels and green engineering the bioblend line just works perfectly with our traditional distribution patterns and with our companys philosophy
1412532 but nobody in our area was carrying these types of products our customers with elevator installations were immediately converted to bioblends hydraulic oil because its biodegradable in 28 days weve been very impressed with the rust penetrating oil and the 2 cycle oil also and our customers like the fact that bioblend products are american made
1412533 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1412534 theres a lot of things to juggle with a project like this and i felt a lot of responsibility
1412535 i had to get into georges head and find out exactly what he wanted us to produce it wasnt that easy in the beginning because i didnt have a lot of access to him he was busy finishing revenge of the sith but i got bits and pieces of information and the bottom line was that he wanted us to produce something that nobody had ever seen before on the television screen and ultimately animation for the movie screen that is really unique
1412536 i thought that it was really important that the crew working on the movie feel the same way i do about this stuff i grew up with star wars and really believe in it its something that inspired me creatively and inspired many generations
1412537 i think we decided that it can but only if it had a kryptonite crystal in it or if the fight took place on a planet with out a yellow sun
1412538 i think living in the star wars world or at least writing in it really gives you a sense of it
1412539 if youre in that world all the time its starts to feel like home and its really easy to write about home when youre familiar with the world and the universe
1412540 george told me that he has a lot of respect for editors and editorial as a craft and an art form so that put me at ease
1412541 hes really open to new ideas at the end of the day what i think i learned most from him is clarity how to make it clear as possible
1412542 as we started to develop the project and he started to see the material he became more and more excited
1412543 ill never forget what he said were not making television here were making cinema
1412544 the acquisition will give atlas copco better geographical coverage allowing us to meet the needs of our global and regional customers in addition industrial power sales employees have a great deal of valuable knowledge and experience which complements that of our own people
1412545 the evidence is there for you now he has fantastic feet
1412546 the young players were fantastic and young rafael the right back was a sensation for me i thought it was a real eye opener for us he hadnt played for a year but hes played a full 90 minutes today his brother fabio has played 45 minutes and hes also done well so were really pleased by their contribution you know what footballs like sometimes it turns up some star some little nugget maybe on the evidence of tonight i think we have got a good player here

1412569 extending terms to four years might suit some communities but im not sure it would suit kelowna kelowna is a changing community going through lots of development the demand for infrastructure is never ending
1412570 i believe a three year term is a good balance it gives us the best of both worlds
1412571 having been a new councillor last year knowing it takes a year to really get up to speed my personal opinion is that a four year term makes more sense there is just so much to learn in the first year then there is just about one year to do the work and then in the third year its like election fever kicks in and everyone goes into election mode
1412572 im happy with whatever is decided its certainly a good topic to discuss there is a financial benefit for a community to have elections every four years instead of three but thats also longer for people to commit their time
1412573 its being totally rebuilt the reason its brown now is because were not irrigating it
1412574 its going to be completely rebuilt and reconfigured as a result of the bridge approach
1412575 with a natural grass field it takes time before you can put people on it we usually like to allow a full season of growing before putting people on it so the field probably wont open until the spring of 2010

1412596 she did not regain consciousness while paramedics were working on her and she was airlifted out
1412597 there is a little blue honda four door civic with some minor damage that person is okay and there was a fellow driving a pickup truck hauling a scissor jack on a trailer he has been taken to hospital but minor injuries certainly compared to the person in the red chev
1412598 i t was northbound in the second lane from the left and we are trying to determine what the circumstances were how she got there but her car was effectively struck broadside right at the driver seat location
1412599 coming to a stop right at 407 and its probably about a 40 minute to an hour delay

1412668 i am preparing to fight a legend and take him down in his own backyard
1412669 even though i am younger i know hopkins is a slick veteran with a bunch of boxing tricks in his bag i refuse to underestimate him and i know on october 18 he will be ready to fight i am treating this as if it were a championship match with my plan being to remain undefeated and show the world that i am able to take on any fighter regardless of age weight or record
1412670 kelly pavlik has a heart of a lion but he has no idea what he is in for on october 18
1412671 pavlik might be the latest thing on a fast track to fame but i am a sure thing and will take this kid to school that night and teach him a lesson he will never forget
1412672 there is no doubt that bernard hopkins is a great fighter and was virtually unstoppable in his prime but kelly pavlik is recognizably one of the best fighters in boxing today and he will continue to prove his himself against a legendary fighter like bernard this is a tremendous challenge for kelly on october 18
1412673 the match up between kelly pavlik and bernard hopkins will be one for the record books
1412674 hopkins has the experience and pavlik has the desire to prove himself i am looking forward to seeing pavlik defend his undefeated record but i know bernard can rise to the occasion and take down one of boxings brightest stars
1412675 kelly pavlik atlantic citys most recent boxing hero and world champion takes on the cagey veteran bernard hopkins from philadelphia in his own back yard caesars atlantic city is proud to continue its tradition of bringing world class events to atlantic city
1412676 a software application that enables a user to display and interact with text images and other information typically located on a web page at a website on the world wide web
1412677 ok maybe i embellished a bit on that last part
1412678 well you see sir daniel and i got so totally wasted on alien goo that without realizing it we did the wild thing in public right on top of one of those dna mix master machines like nirrti had yes sir the machine was very active at the time which is why daniel is now two months along with my love child on a positive note the crowd in the temple enjoyed our performance so much that they play tapes of it world wide continually theres even a thriving souvenir business which im sure has helped their economy along lets say we chalk that mission up as a win in the humanitarian aid column
1412679 during their visit to the temple colonel oneill and doctor jackson were inadvertently exposed to extraordinarily high levels of a psychotropic substance used during the ritual in which they were participating
1412680 this impaired their cognitive abilities in much the same way as extreme inebriation would
1412681 due to this impairment the colonel and daniel were unable to identify the dna manipulating device which had been built into the altar and dais on which the ritual took place and which was therefore nearly unrecognizable although the machine was active at the time of the ritual the people there have no understanding of it or the technology its composed of there is no record of what settings were in place on the machine at that time
1412682 it is extremely doubtful that daniels condition could be reversed in any way
1412683 are you absolutely certain that theres nothing to be done
1412684 we spoke to one of the demarians who let us into the temple
1412685 said demarian the people on p98 j4d are the omri
1412686 because it was a demarian that took us to the temple
1412687 no granny one tooth and the giant bee took us to the temple
1412688 if you are referring to the elder her son and his family that met us at the gate then yes they accompanied us but only to the city of grebat
1412689 my point daniel is that granny jed and the rest of the clampetts are omri
1412690 yes yes but marliota acolyte of the second level of tralan is also a demarian
1412691 as i recall from our initial briefing the term demarian refers to the priests and their ilk among the omri
1412692 thank you tealc demarian is a collective term for anyone affiliated with the religious order on the planet whether they are priests nuns acolytes or anyone who serves them marliota was an acolyte therefore he is a demarian as well as an omri
1412693 well maybe if you had said that to begin with i would have known
1412694 that was months ago and anyway you must have mumbled that part because i missed it
1412695 maybe if you spent your time listening instead of scribbling pornographic stick figures in the margins of your note pad
1412696 what im hearing is that i can safely say that dr jacksons unique condition was brought about by his proximity to colonel oneill in the presence of unknown alien technology that was activated without their knowledge
1412697 you are all dismissed but i want your written reports by the end of the day tomorrow
1412698 how often do i get to go off world besides maybe you should ask sam about her new t shirt
1412699 it was pretty and the picture doesnt show anything um naughty besides like the colonel said the writing on it is an alien script so no one on earth will know what it means
1412700 i myself purchased two shirts a ceramic mug and one set of carved wooden figurines which the merchant assured me were accurate representations of specific moments from the recording of your coupling at the temple
1412701 t man im begging you not the little statues theyve got our faces on them everyone will know its me and daniel and theyll see exactly what we were doing
1412702 very well you have my word that i shall view the figures only in private
1412703 do you want me to make him hand them over
1412704 its done now i guess ill have to accept it
1412705 im just disappointed that each of you bought something when you know how jack and i feel about them
1412706 you should be certain that oneills view of this matter truly is the same as yours before including him in that statement
1412707 i know youre up to something and if you fess up now i wont be nearly as pissed as i would be if i had to figure it out on my own but either way youre in trouble mister
1412708 i think its time for those things doc fraiser gave you
1412709 im not so out of it that i cant find my ass
1412710 let me get you a glass of water to rinse out your mouth
1412711 i thought of a great name for him gordie howe
1412712 gordie howe dr jackson is one of the greatest hockey players of all time as i believe i have mentioned repeatedly
1412713 hey thats a great idea well put the two together and call him gordie wayne
1412714 if you want to name him after a famous person how about something classical like horace
1412715 thats a great name if you want our kid to get beaten up every day you might as well slap a loser sign on his back as you send him off to school
1412716 if youre going to give him a sissy name at least pick out a guy that kicked ass like horatio he held off the entire etruscan army single handed at the bridge across the tiber still had a sissy name though
1412717 i just i dont want to give him some ordinary name that 50 other kids in his class will have alternate spellings not withstanding
1412718 sheesh daniel no need to shout i was just kidding
1412719 youre not nearly as funny as you think you are jack
1412720 okay daniel you dont need to undress completely for this
1412721 i just need to access your abdominal area for the ultrasound
1412722 when it goes here daniel its called gel or jelly
1412723 so that could be either of us and since im officially the one whos better
1412724 ill be happy to handle your subject for you any day
1412725 the way the fetus is positioned we cant see that area
1412726 youll be getting regular ultrasounds from now on so there will be other opportunities to find out the gender
1412727 well that would certainly be consistent with the pregnancy as a whole
1412728 ill be putting copies of the ultrasound pictures in your file plus ive printed an extra one for you to keep unfortunately the printer is down the hallway so if youll wait here ill be back in a minute
1412729 yeah but it didnt feel real until now seeing that picture seeing the the
1412730 seriously daniel i dont think my ass can take any more
1412731 fine then suck me fuck me jerk me off just do something okay
1412732 you seem to be doing fine on your own just go beat off
1412733 jerking off doesnt feel the same and you know it you do it
1412734 love you too daniel now come on weve got a game to watch
1412735 as i recall there was an all too brief period of time approximately midway through gestation when dreyacs desires were greatly increased other than feeling our son move within her that is my most fond memory of that time
1412736 oh yeah sara did the same thing when she was pregnant with charlie i tell ya i couldnt wait to get home at night it was over far too soon but it sure was fun while it lasted
1412737 why is it that you are not enthused about the experience with daniel jackson
1412738 well t it turns out that there is such a thing as too much sex who knew
1412739 it is common knowledge among your closest associates that within the confines of your relationship with daniel jackson you are in fact a slut oneill
1412740 yeah well one look at the poses in that souvenir figurine collection of me and daniel should be enough to clue anyone in granted those have it the other way around with daniel um
1412741 i am afraid i am unable to view the collection
1412742 well i didnt mean right now but when you get back to the base maybe or not not works best for me
1412743 i meant that i am unable to view them at all
1412744 several years ago i repeatedly declined a second invitation to accompany you fishing in response you suggested that i take up a hobby i did
1412745 youve been winding us up all these years just pushing our buttons and watching us dance
1412746 it has been most amusing as well as incredibly simple i believe the appropriate saying is you are an easy target oneill as is daniel jackson
1412747 you played us like a couple of violins a comment here and a comment there and were off on a tizzy
1412748 the arrangement of vegetation both harvested and viable into aesthetically pleasing and situationally appropriate designs
1412749 your timing is impeccable daniel jackson as we have only just finished assembling the infants furnishings
1412750 honestly it wasnt bad at all sam had some great ideas about baby proofing the house and she and janet both have excellent taste waitll you see some of the outfits they got and the bedding and the toys and room decorations frankly the longer i thought about it today the more i realized how lucky we are in our friends im exceedingly grateful to them for helping us out like this
1412751 thank you when my sister in law was pregnant i was usually on the other side of the country the few times i was around her the movement always stopped before i could feel it
1412752 so are you ready to see what we managed to scrounge up
1412753 nine oclock on a saturday morning is too early to run errands
1412754 its more fun than waiting around for the truck to get serviced and doing the grocery shopping and whatever else is on the list
1412755 you can keep me company make it more fun for both of us
1412756 i just want to get this done while im on a roll
1412757 well theres that ive also got to pick up the dry cleaning and run by the drug store i might get a haircut too while im out so dont expect me back for a few hours
1412758 fine fine take your time i mean dont skimp on anything that needs doing ive got plenty to occupy me right here
1412759 you seem a little down did something happen while i was out
1412760 why could i possibly seem down oh i know ive gotten so big that i have to wear my pants lower and lower just to get them fastened and now ive got plumbers crack i havent got a waist anymore the only time i can see my penis is when i look in the mirror and who wants to do that
1412761 nothing fits my back hurts constantly my skin itches and im getting stretchmarks
1412762 im fat and ugly and no one will ever want me again
1412763 i know youve gone through some changes some of them inconvenient but think of the miracle behind those changes
1412764 theres life in there a little person whos depending on you how incredible is that
1412765 youve never looked more handsome to me than you do right now i will always love you daniel and i will always want you count on it
1412766 dammit its bad enough to keep anyone waiting but to do it to someone who cant even sit comfortably while they wait is unacceptable
1412767 i know youre uncomfortable but im here for you daniel were in this together
1412768 so which of us has swollen up like one of those giant balloons from the thanksgiving day parade because i dont see you stomping around like godzilla with a glandular problem
1412769 whens the last time you had a bowel movement jack oh wait that was this morning wasnt it i remember because last night i told you very clearly to lay off the bean dip and after you spent just five minutes in the bathroom this morning it was obvious that you had refused to listen and would it kill you to use the spray
1412770 i havent moved my bowels in almost a week and you can bet that when i finally do ill be crapping little rocks and wont that be fun oh dont you wrinkle up your nose at me sorry if you find this conversation too crude for your delicate sensibilities
1412771 i know youre a little tired because you havent been sleeping well but
1412772 right like anyone could sleep with you flouncing around the house like june cleavers campy gay brother with an obsession for cleanliness
1412773 chrisakes daniel you make it sound like im mincing around in a frilly apron and pearls taking a feather duster to the furniture
1412774 that was my barbecue apron and i only wore it for the pockets maybe youve forgotten but im doing both of our chores now so instead of heaping derision on me maybe a little thank you would be in order
1412775 considering the layer of dust thats still on the mantle
1412776 upon your return to your domicile you may quarrel all you wish but for now you will conduct yourselves as befitting your rank and position within this facility
1412777 you two are left alone for a few minutes and it turns into world war three i could hear you down the hallway dont you have any sense of decorum
1412778 it was not our intent to intrude upon your personal examination
1412779 im afraid thats my fault for being late this shouldnt take too long though they can meet you in the commissary in about fifteen minutes
1412780 this wont be as thorough as the exam you just had its more of a follow up i take it the back pain hasnt abated
1412781 i thought so while back pain is common especially during the later stages of pregnancy the pain youve reported has been both more severe and more chronic in nature ive spent the last few days doing research one item of significance has to do with you being a man a womans spinal column is structurally different from yours specifically in the lower back
1412782 the vertebrae there are more wedge shaped its one of the ways we can identify the gender of skeletal remains we find on a site
1412783 wedge shaped just like the stones you might find in the archway of an old building when put together the wedge shapes create the curve of that arch and allows the stone to support more weight than it would if it were straight now in terms of biomechanics what this means is that a womans lower spine curves more as the pregnancy proceeds allowing it to support the greater weight of the abdomen
1412784 im not sure the back aches he has are most likely because of his male spinal configuration on the other hand nirrtis machine may have anticipated this and programmed a change to the spinal column to adapt in that case the back aches hes feeling could be from the vertebrae changing shape
1412785 we could try an mri and look at the shape of the vertebrae
1412786 all of the sources i checked suggest that it is but i will leave that decision up to you however regardless of whether you have the scan or not im afraid im going to have to order partial bed rest for you
1412787 you dont need to lie flat but you do need to recline at enough of an angle to take the pressure off of your lower back you can still work within reason but youll have to do it from home after you meet sam and tealc you have one hour to get what you need from your office as of now you are officially on limited duty youll only come in for appointments or if you are requested by general hammond thats it you can be up out of bed for no more than one hour at a time for a cumulative total of four hours a day
1412788 now you have first dibs on the recliner in the den
1412789 what are you kidding its as much as my life is worth to touch that thing
1412790 youve made me wrestle you for it several times and there were no playoffs for any sport of any kind involved
1412791 that was less about possession of the chair and more about the um manly grappling
1412792 for the past month the only time ive been out of the house is for my doctors appointments i actually look forward to them now just for the change of scenery
1412793 youve been outside in the yard and youve gone to the grocery store with me
1412794 theres that little park about 15 minutes from the house subtracting travel time wed have half an hour left of your one hour limit but that would be enough for a picnic lunch how about we add that to our schedule on a regular basis
1412795 everything looks fine how is everything anything new since i saw you last
1412796 did you just say treasure trail to the person who is both our doctor and our friend
1412797 what like theres a clinical term for the line of hair leading from your belly button to your pubes
1412798 its okay daniel patients use common terms all the time it doesnt bother us doctors one bit now just what do you mean by wrong
1412799 the skin there feels harder than the surrounding area and jack said theres something funny with the hairs it started right after i saw you last week and has been getting more pronounced each day
1412800 okay go ahead and drop trou for me so i can take a look at whats going on
1412801 hmmm i see what you mean i can feel something under there let me get a better look
1412802 theres another more defined ridge running horizontally just above the pubic arch hmmm you know thats about where the incision for a c section would go
1412803 if you look closely this actually has two edges running parallel to each other
1412804 now look between those edges and youll see extremely fine hairs notice that the hairs on the bottom edge are all looped the hairs on the top edge are all curved into a hook shape
1412805 just look at both halves of a velcro fastener and thats exactly what youll see
1412806 the word velcro itself is actually a mix of two french words velours meaning velvet which is made of uncut pile so the threads are stil looped and crochet meaning hook
1412807 so when my mom talked about using a crochet hook she was actually saying a hook hook
1412808 well i think we have our answer as to how the baby will emerge this is nowhere near done yet but it looks as though your body is preparing a birth canal of sorts
1412809 this is actually good news daniel now that i know what how your body is going to adapt i can make more specific plans for the birth itself for now well keep to our regular appointment schedule but colonel ill need you to make daily observations so if there are any rapid changes well know right away
1412810 dont worry about having the baby just think about what that means
1412811 as major carter informed you the first several times you questioned her she is well aware of daniel jacksons caffeine restriction and took great care to be certain that the coffee was decaffeinated to the point of ordering both hers and his as decaffeinated and watching the preparation thereof from start to finish
1412812 its sinfully delicious is what it is thanks for the treat sam this really hit the spot
1412813 carter call fraiser tell her were on our way to the mountain tealc help me get him to the truck
1412814 janet said to remind you that water breaking does not necessarily mean hes gone into labor its the contractions we need to look for how frequent how long they last and how intense they are daniel could still have several hours before those start though regardless the baby would need to be delivered within 24 hours
1412815 okay but take the colonel with you while youre in there i want you to strip and put this on
1412816 remember when the water sterilization tablets didnt work on m98 gr3
1412817 we all got montezumas revenge except tealc of course i dont ever want to do that again why is that what the contractions are like
1412818 okay this may be progressing much faster than i anticipated
1412819 its okay colonel a large percentage of women get the urge to squat or kneel during labor
1412820 the position lets them bear down more forcefully i think daniel should be allowed to follow his instincts if hes feeling that same urge we should let him do it
1412821 daniel now that youre upright we cant keep the gown out of the way so that we can see youll have to take it off
1412822 if so there are some anxious people outside who would like to say hello
1412823 thats fine just give us a few minutes first if you dont mind
1412824 shes the most beautiful thing ive ever seen shes perfect lets call her mary sue
1412825 theres no way im having a mary sue for a daughter
1412826 do you mind if we name her claire after my mother
1412827 that would be nice what about a middle name though
1412828 i thought maybe i know belle is actually your mothers nickname whats her real name
1412829 i have a better idea how about we call her claire share
1412830 yeah i mean she is a joint venture so to speak
1412831 that was one of the quickest deliveries ive ever heard of
1412832 little claire slid out like a greased pig on ice
1412833 what a charming way to describe the birth of ones child
1412834 shes the daughter of a special ops colonel and a formerly ascended genius
1412835 i think shes got your mouth and maybe your hands
1412836 or maybe shell be her own nightlight every night well just have to wait and see
1412837 in that respect i guess shes no different than any other child every child is special in some way their parents just have to wait and see what it will be

1412840 american families continue to struggle with the high cost of gasoline and they are looking to congress to do something about it

1412842 top 10 states where household spending has decreased most during the economic downturn
1412843 top 10 states where household spending has decreased most during the economic downturn
1412844 one of the main reasons for the trend is financial difficulties arising from credit card spending overdrafts and other debts resulting in people taking insolvency advice comparisons with the early 90s are ill founded people are taking a view that they may as well going into less expensive rented accommodation than spend all of their income on mortgages and secured loans that will take a lifetime to pay off
1412845 people realise the repossession process will affect their credit rating but they are not too worried about that as most have serious debt problems anyway
1412846 the whole process of repossession turns secured debts into unsecured ones if advice is taken early by taking out an iva or going bankruptcy then losses can be mitigated the worst thing to do is bury your head in the sand the debts wont go way unless you deal with them

1412895 it takes courage to demand time for yourself at first glance it may seem to be the ultimate in selfishness a real slap in the face to those who love and depend on you it is not it means you care enough to want to see the best in yourself and give only the best to others
1412896 if you are not taking care of yourself body mind and spirit the people in your life dont get the best of you they get whats left of you
1412897 breathing in i calm my body breathing out i smile dwelling in the present moment i know this is a wonderful moment

1412899 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

1412924 the cottage is of great significance to the history of the city and we are desperate to try and save and rebuild it
1412925 we have had a grant from the lottery to investigate the property already but we are now embarking on a fundraising campaign to help with the next step of the operation
1412926 there is no definite cost as yet but it could run to nearly a 100 000 to do it properly
1412927 we are also desperate for more information such as who lived there in the years after the gardens moved to stockbridge so if anybody has any information regarding that they should get in touch with us
1412928 the cottage has an important place in our history as it was an integral part of the garden as built by professor john hope in 1764
1412929 we are concerned about the future of this building and have been in discussion with the botanic cottage working group
1412930 the group is trying to make sure that a careful archaeological survey is made of the building and its surrounding area
1412931 our grant will mean that the secret histories of botanic cottage can be revealed and shared and that people can learn about it long after the building itself has disappeared
1412932 i have been researching animal behaviour in relation to human behaviour for the past year and a half during this process i saw this empty enclosure and i thought it would be a fantastic idea
1412933 i found many similarities some of them are in relation to the primates our ability and the primates ability to use tools to use gesture as a form of expression to have emotional experiences to be able to be involved in compassionate behaviour but also devious and cheating behaviour
1412934 the performance is an exhibition of human behaviour through movement and the art of dance
1412935 the statement im focusing on is to do with conservation and particularly attention to the primates im hoping that people will realise through watching our performance how connected we are to the great ape we are in the same super family as the chimpanzees
1412936 its particularly important in 2008 because of the great need in this world to address many of these issues and im also hoping that many people will start to see the art of dance and movement and beautiful means of poetic expression
1412937 the wide range of shows that connect with current issues in our world demonstrates that the fringe is an incredibly flexible platform for artists the fringe was founded on the principle of open access for all performers and it continues to be the best place to showcase new work

1412946 publishers have done a very good job of maintaining a one sided financial model throughout the industry and the real reason comes down to their desire to own the intellectual property

1412950 in many cases the creative leads just arent interested in running hr and accounting and finance anymore

1413033 my problem with the schedule change was that money bought tradition in the sport

1413060 the heavenly man is the intensely dramatic story of how god took a young half starved boy from a poor village in henan province and used him mightily to preach the gospel despite horrific opposition brother yun is one of chinas house church leaders a man who despite his relative youth has suffered prolonged torture and imprisonment for his faith his account challenges any complacency about the situation in china where international economic investment ignores the brutal fact that religious persecution is still a daily reality for millions instead of focusing on the many miracles or experiences of suffering however yun prefers to emphasize the character and beauty of jesus this astonishing book will form a watershed in your spiritual life

1413073 the machine must be cleansed let it be cleansed will it to be cleansed it shall be cleansed
1413074 you you have invaded this place of worship the house of god
1413075 ive hit dozens of places like this in the past three years hoping that ill find some release from the pain of living but once every cultist every murderer every rapist lies dead i feel hollow once more not this time though this time ive found what im looking for except now that i have it i dont know what i should do
1413076 should i release it give it a hug tell it how glad i am to see it after all these years
1413077 and send her back into that nothingness a fitting revenge for the pain shes caused for all of us left behind
1413078 we received an interesting message from a local bottom feeder who told us that a girl called cameron wished to meet john naturally i was sent to investigate but when i got there the place had already been hit by these freaks and you were gone so i followed their trail to this location and here you were ready to be given a thermite bath guess i got here just in time didnt i
1413079 how about you tell me where the hell youve been all this time
1413080 i never left this city i cant explain what happened to me all i remember is falling asleep on a beach in 2008 and waking up in 2011 i have no idea how it happened and the only conclusion i can think of makes little sense
1413081 time travel right okay so if there was a tde on that beach then why wasnt john transported as well
1413082 in our house he seemed to be looking for something
1413083 john sent him to check the house in case you returned hes been doing that for years but he hasnt returned what happened to him
1413084 he was killed by the bureau it was an ambush
1413085 how the hell am i going to explain to john that his uncle is dead especially after losing you and then sa never mind ill think of something cmon get your things we have to get you back to john
1413086 a friend of myself and connor so let us in already
1413087 john is the leader of the largest mafia group in the whole of los angeles the only ones powerful enough to bring him down are the bureau and theyll have to find him first
1413088 you could say that hes no godfather but that doesnt mean he isnt scary cmon
1413089 so i see have you forgotten what john told you about picking up strangers
1413090 i remember but she isnt just some stranger this is my sister ive been looking for her for years
1413091 and now after all this time she finally turns up how convenient
1413092 i assure you she is not a spy is he in
1413093 yes we caught a few agents today hes interrogating a rather tough one in your absence
1413094 i suppose go ahead but be careful hes not in a very good mood at the moment apparently his uncle was found dead hes pretty distraught the poor thing
1413095 well at least i wasnt the one to tell him
1413096 oh yes like i said very distraught id be careful around him dear he might decide to take out his frustration on you
1413097 john isnt the same person you knew everything that has happened these past years has had a serious effect on him you may not recognise him at all and i honestly have no idea how he is going to react when he sees you so be careful and dont provoke him in any way
1413098 you ready to talk now or would you like me to start working on your fronts i imagine that will be a very unpleasant experience
1413099 now you see that wont accomplish anything cos if i die the whole world is screwed cos you see im the one destined to save humanity from total annihilation but i cant do that if you lot keep hunting me all the time so do the world a favour and answer my fucking question
1413100 its too bad my friend i was having such a good time now my best man will finish what ive started and trust me compared to him im a fluffy teddy bear come in
1413101 i dont wanna talk about that this here is a place of business
1413102 get her away from me take her away lock her up
1413103 ethan so help me god if you dont remove her now ill reduce you both to scrap
1413104 im sorry about this but hed flay my skin off if i didnt take these unnecessary measures
1413105 but he didnt kill you which is something he often said hed do should you ever show up again so a part of him still cares he just needs time to adjust to the idea of having you back
1413106 ill try but you have to understand john has lost everything he ever held dear he was nearly driven insane by your disappearance he blamed everyone but not half as much as he blamed himself he angered the wrong people and provoked a violent response that led to his mothers death the guilt of that coupled with the loss of you led him down a very dark path and the world seemed to be dragged down along with him
1413107 you may have been the catalyst but that doesnt mean it was your fault if what you said is true then you are no more to blame than i am this is skynets doing and there is nothing you couldve done to prevent it
1413108 you cant just lock her up and forget about her
1413109 damn it john all these years youve been looking for her all this time and now now that she has finally returned to you you want to pretend she doesnt exist
1413110 what hiding from your pain ive told you before you cant lie to me i served by your side for five years in the resistance i know you better than you know yourself so stop lying to me stop lying to yourself and talk to her
1413111 i wake up after what was possibly the best day of my sad and sorry existence and youre gone explain to me why that was
1413112 i woke up without any clothes on that very beach alone i dont know what happened all i know is that i had somehow travelled forward by three years

1413340 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1413341 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1413342 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1413343 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence

1413357 mi piacerebbe incontrare la squadra di luis aragon s ha affermato lallenatore una partita contro il fenerbah e susciterebbe grande interesse a baku ma per ora siamo concentrati sulla sfida contro il partizan dopo il sorteggio eravamo dati per spacciati ma abbiamo dimostrato di essere alla pari dei nostri ben pi quotati avversari

1413359 the common word was and is an extended global handshake of religious goodwill friendship and fellowship and consequently of interreligious peace
1413360 that is to say then the governments of islamic majority countries have not banded together against the governments of christian majority countries much less an alliance with china
1413361 there seem to be five major factors driving global religious tensions
1413362 thus now according to the results of the largest international religious survey in history as outlined in the seminal book by esposito and mogahed 60 percent of christians
1413363 with such an explosive mix popular religious conflicts even unto genocide are lurking around the corner
1413364 my feeling is that god forbid a few more terrorist attacks a few more national security emergencies a few more demagogues a few more national protection laws and then internment camps if not concentration camps are not inconceivable in some places and that these would inevitably spawn endless global counter reactions
1413365 moreover as the gallup survey showed we are now actually at the stage where we as christians and muslims routinely mistrust disrespect and dislike each other if not popularly and actively rubbish dehumanise demonise despise and attack each other
1413366 and how much more likely would this be when we are all finally struck with the apparently looming catastrophes of global climate change and when the competition for food and natural resources becomes more fierce
1413367 this is the background behind the launching of the common word
1413368 we started with christianity bilaterally simply because islam and christianity are the largest two religions in the world and in history and so in that sense islamic christian dialogue is the most critical
1413369 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1413370 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign

1413372 good stuff only from writers who started out as genre sf writers
1413373 one of the reasons why were at black hat is to hear feedback and make sure that these programs are as effective as we intend them to be
1413374 the overall theme of trustworthy computing is about continuing to evolve as the online threats continue to involve and the exploit index and mapp are examples of our evolution
1413375 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1413376 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1413377 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1413378 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1413379 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live

1413396 fifteen years ago today working families everywhere achieved a victory when the family and medical leave act went into effect this groundbreaking law helps guarantee that americas workers shouldnt have to choose between their jobs or their health and the health of their families

1413421 discussion of the schillinger system of composition7 has made schillinger famous as a theorist and one is apt to forget he was a skilled and interesting composer
1413422 all the piano works in the two sets under discussion here fall into the same general category they were written at a time when scriabins was the greatest influence among most young russians scriabin was felt to be the great new force creating fresh musical materials a casual look at the pages of these piano pieces suggests that schillinger works are no more than the imitation of scriabins chords and general style but closer examination reveals that while schillinger has adopted scriabins form his chord spacing and his idea of exploring new sounds the actual chords are not scriabins famous chord of nature but are schillingers own moreover the tonal relations are far more daring than those of scriabin there is more counterpoint and there are excursions into unheard of keys

1413442 ci che accaduto con daniele luttazzi riguarda luso inappropriato del mezzo televisivo non la libert di satira
1413443 la7 vive infatti proprio dei capisaldi di libert di espressione di rispetto verso le persone che vi lavorano e verso il pubblico che la segue quotidianamente come dimostrato ampiamente dagli ultimi anni di lavoro non vi quindi nessuna limitazione della satira ambito nella quale ritengo luttazzi sia tra i pi bravi se non addirittura il pi bravo in italia e rispetto alla quale a la7 ha avuto libert assoluta come le cinque puntate andate in onda stanno a dimostrare ritengo conclude campo dallorto in questo caso specifico si sia invece trattato di insulti rivolti ad una altra persona tra laltro parte della stessa rete e per questo la nostra decisione vuole difendere il principio delluso responsabile di un bene prezioso come la libert di espressione vero punto al centro della nostre riflessioni e della nostra decisione di sospendere il programma

1413447 la7 alcune cose sulle quali ci piacerebbe avere delle risposte
1413448 e una bella manifestazione pienamente legittima di cui non condivido la natura politica quindi visto che la mia presenza piuttosto ingombrante lascio lo studio e torno a casa

1413456 le espressioni usate sono palesemente in contrasto con la satira
1413457 gli abbiamo dato tutta la libert poi ci ha toccato ferrara e lo censuriamo per sempre
1413458 siamo stanchi di sentire stronzate basta se pensate che litalia sia un gigantesco monopoli alla merc di qualche riccone vi sbagliate non potete controllarci non potete decidere voi cosa giusto e cosa non lo dovete sottostare al sistema democratico di questo cazzo di paese o lo fate con le buone oppure prima o poi vi ritroverete a doverlo fare con le cattive perch ricordate che anche un popolo ha la sua pazienza e quella del popolo italiano credo sia in veloce esaurimento
1413459 ci che sospettiamo accada ma che altri o i nostri pregiudizi ci nascondono
1413460 le idee e le parole di ferrara e dei suoi referenti politici a proposito della guerra sono una cacca
1413461 qualsiasi cosa che non faccia alzare il telefono a giuliano ferrara indispettito
1413462 come si fa a sopportare una cosa del genere io ho un mio sistema penso a giuliano ferrara immerso in una vasca da bagno con berlusconi e dellutri che gli piscia addosso previti che gli caga in bocca ed io che li frusto tutti perch mi stanno sul cazzo
1413463 sono palesemente in contrasto con la satira e si configurano come una provocazione alla dignita e allonore personale

1413473 luttazzi stato sospeso perch ha violato l accordo stipulato con l emittente basato sulla libert ma anche sul senso di responsabilit
1413474 trattandosi di una emittente fondata sul binomio inscindibile di liberta e responsabilita verso le persone cosi come verso il pubblico
1413475 i contenuti video relativi al programma decameron per motivi di diritti non sono pi disponibili sul sito

1413496 a rule of thumb when creating your own would be to use one half to three fourths of a sheet of gelatin for every ounce of liquid and let it set overnight if youre using gelatin powder a quarter ounce packet is the equivalent of four sheets of gelatin for strong drinks such as martinis or manhattans either make them into small shapes or dilute them with simple syrup sugar dissolved in an equal amount of boiling water you can use relatively inexpensive silicone ice cube trays in fun shapes to release the cocktails once theyre set run the tip of a sharp knife around the top edge then carefully work them out of the molds or use plastic candy molds this requires running the underside of the molds under hot water to release the jelly or just pour the gelatin liquor mixture into plastic wrap lined baking pans and once set cut it into cubes or slices thats the easiest way

1413529 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1413530 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1413531 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1413532 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal

1413543 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts said emily goulding 25 of los angeles
1413544 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1413545 obamas big with the kids everyone knows that said tom johnson 21 of norfolk va
1413546 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1413547 its got to be obama said david munn 20 of keene n
1413548 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1413549 cool thing down hes an avid basketball player listens to jay z on his ipod and was on the cover of this months issue of rolling stone magazine
1413550 illiterate when it comes to using a computer he turns 72 next month and if elected hed be the oldest president in american history to begin his first term
1413551 coolness or the perception of it at least really matter to young voters
1413552 i dont think you can ignore that factor said james kotecki a 22 year old political video blogger who achieved fame on youtube last year after he interviewed former republican presidential candidate ron paul in koteckis georgetown university dorm room
1413553 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go said kotecki whose video commentaries now appear on politico com the website for the washington political newspaper
1413554 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1413555 coolness is often associated with youth but elder status doesnt automatically signify
1413556 you can certainly be cool at any age kotecki said
1413557 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1413558 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are goodstein said
1413559 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1413560 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either souris said
1413561 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1413562 its a popular topic however i havent given really much thought to these soaps
1413563 i skipped 15 episodes and when i returned i found that nothing new took place and so i decided to quit if the media stops all this fuss then the addiction would go away there is no need to force people to stop watching the soaps just give them time and they will quit themselves
1413564 i became curious when these programs were being mentioned in the press and i started watching them i found nothing special there wasnt anything attractive in the stars and what they present is far from reality
1413565 being aggressive in dealing with such cases is just fruitless this imam has not done anything positive the people in the town would simply look for another way to watch the series

1413592 some key bulls are leaner and more explosive coming out of the gates at the start of training camp south florida dual threat quarterback matt grothe might be extra dangerous scrambling around this year after losing some extra baggage in the offseason
1413593 when the university of south florida went through mondays first practice it was like no other season opening workout in program history for the first time the bulls began fall drills with a number before their name no 21 ranked usf
1413594 if the bulls have a successful season in 2008 they will no longer be shocking the college football world last season the bulls ascended from being unranked during the preseason to no 2 in the nation by oct 14 south florida faltered down the stretch but the bulls still finished with a 9 4 record including a spot in the sun bowl in el paso texas
1413595 as initial practices go monday didnt appear all that different from any first day in south floridas first 12 seasons as a football program nose around long enough though and theres an unmistakable air that didnt accompany the bulls in any previous august

1413603 the womens division in tna definitely sets us apart from any other form of womens wrestling because we offer something called variety none of us looks exactly the same theres blonde hair dark hair red hair no hair it sets us apart because we all look different we all dress different we all wrestle different and we dont offer fluff n nutter that you see elsewhere were hard hitting
1413604 you would never see that the women be the main event but the ratings speak for themselves the guys in tna work their butts off theres no doubt about it but in the history of wrestling nobody has ever looked at the women
1413605 nobody has ever looked at the women as actual competition for the men
1413606 it already has before the knockouts division i would say no because look what the prime focus of the competition of womens wrestling was it was bra and panties matches it was lingerie swimming pools jell o matches pillow fights that will not compare to any form of mens wrestling
1413607 now with the knockouts were getting the highest rated segments on the show we wrestle and people want to see us theyre demanding to see us theyre actually tuning in to see us

1413662 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1413663 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1413664 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1413708 arent you sad that the work is so temporary most street painters i know feel that the ephemeral nature of street painting makes it more special to us its a gift to those who get to witness the actual creation we take a lot of photos and go on to do the next one
1413709 anamorphic images are very distorted when viewed by the naked eye
1413710 one way to create a 3 d looking piece without doing a true anamorphic image which is created using specific mathematical formulas and grids is to do an illusionary image an illusionary piece will utilize some anamorphic principals stretching the image at the top but it is mostly done using tromp loeil principles and creating three dimension using highlights and shadows ive found that most illusionary images work best incorporating the main focus of the image as a hole in the pavement that type of image can easily be recognized by the viewer as a 3 d piece without having to view it through a camera lens
1413711 we will have to watch over time how it correlates to other ratings and rankings and whether it offers new information or reiterates the existing rankings

1413724 i think its wrong to allow adoptions of children by gay and lesbian couples
1413725 i think it sends a wrong message early to a child during formative years thats hard to overcome just by sitting down and talking to them and telling them its okay
1413726 i still think that there ought to be ways for us to provide a loving environment for children without sending a wrong message to them early or a message that we have to sit down and try to explain some psychological damage or emotional damage or something later on in life
1413727 i think that lesbianism and homosexuality is morally wrong and the laws supposed to discriminate sometimes

1413730 were just concentrating on what we know best and thats to go out there and win
1413731 were going to look forward to the opening night monday night game against green bay
1413732 i couldnt say that we just know that our team will be there sept 8 at lambeau field ready to play
1413733 i have no comment on that ill let the decision stand and move on
1413734 as i said before i look forward to the opening night game against green bay
1413735 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1413736 with the popularity of 3 d street painting images making their way around the internet there are many requests for three dimensional street painting images to be created at one day festivals and corporate events the limitation with this scenario is that virtually all the 3 d images you see on the web are very involved and require more than one day to complete the only way to create a one day 3 d image is to keep the design very simple and make it quite small that really contradicts what the art form is all about in order for the image to work as a three dimensional piece especially if you want real people to interact with it it needs to be in the neighborhood of 12 feet or 14 feet square which for me would be impossible to finish in 5 to 8 hours the images you see on the web generally take 3 to 4 eight hour days to complete and sometimes even longer depending on the complexity of the design i have worked on pieces that have taken 50 hours to complete just remember that if you want to create a gigantic intricate 3 d piece be prepared to invest a lot of time
1413737 the industry is reaching a point where delivering an acceptable level of security today is beyond what one company can do alone wrote microsofts andrew cushman in the blogs inaugural post
1413738 theres real merit in the clich it takes a village
1413739 think of it as community based defense where we commit our skills and strengths to defend beyond our boundaries to protect our common customers
1413740 you cant put a grade on products and services from a security standpoint
1413741 the best thing you can do is get the information out
1413742 theres definitely no end point to security so i think that whatever is done to foster collaboration is a step in the right direction
1413743 we will try to get a backup aircraft and get them on their way
1413744 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky
1413745 beginning this fall our passengers will have the ability to stay connected when they travel with us throughout the continental u s
1413746 the advent of air to ground atg technology has made broadband connectivity in the cabin economically viable for the first time for commercial airlines
1413747 the game has changed and delta will be among the first to provide an enhanced customer experience with broadband wi fi access on more than 1 000 daily flights within the u s
1413748 you get on board in your entirely carbon composite spaceship youre lifted to 50 000ft youre then dropped a rocket fires and within six seconds youre doing the speed of sound within about 20 seconds youre at nearly 3 000mph and you climb up into space and you get up to about 70 miles above the earth
1413749 the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure way too inexperienced and naive people
1413750 what were good at is really pressuring guys and we just kinda let them run their offense let them move the ball around if you let a team do that especially a team that knows each other the way that this team does theyre gonna eat you up and they moved it around until they got the shot they wanted
1413751 he can get to the basket at will and his jumpers falling too been probably our most consistent guy night in and night out for this team him and lebron
1413752 but if you dont make shots and you still win by double digits youre still happy imagine if we make shots
1413753 we won the ball game we found a way to win
1413754 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1413759 brunswick is one of the largest boat companies in the country so i dont think theres a problem
1413760 i think theyre just trying to save a little money with the production cutbacks
1413761 i think everybody has been making their own adjustments for what the market demands
1413762 i would rather see them do this sooner than later
1413763 i think they just have to react to the marketplace
1413764 brunswick has to answer to its shareholders and dealers are not selling anything
1413765 i just wish there was some way to gain back consumer confidence the industry is doing everything it can with its dealer certification programs grow boating and discover boating campaigns
1413766 the objective of our downsizing efforts is to ensure solid profitability for our business in this tough domestic marine market
1413767 efforts to reduce our hourly workforce help to ensure that direct labor remains a truly variable cost as we face lower unit volume in other words it is a key factor to prevent further slippage in growth margin
1413768 maintaining liquidity will continue to be a key priority in these uncertain times
1413769 we are resizing the company for solid profitability under current conditions
1413770 we cannot plan based on an assumption that markets will on a unit basis reach levels of three or four years ago in the near term
1413771 were not predicting where the market is going what were doing is sizing ourselves so no matter what happens with the market well be able to be profitable
1413772 the prolonged downturn in the u s marine market by continually reducing production rates throughout our marine businesses divesting underutilized assets exiting or divesting certain businesses eliminating discretionary spending and reducing head count
1413773 while these efforts have resulted in significant savings the realities of the current u s marine market have caused us to step up the pace and magnitude of these efforts
1413774 our objective is to thrive and prosper while the u s marine market remains under pressure and to outperform when we see a rebound in demand
1413775 consumers digest is a name that consumers have trusted for many years something that people rely on for the most accurate and reliable information on just about any product they wish to invest in
1413776 to receive such a positive response from such a reputable publication is a testament not only to the attributes of the boat itself but also the pride and skill of the men and women who give everything they can to produce the finest fishing boats on the water
1413777 it is a pleasure to recognize the recipients of this years marine industry csi awards
1413778 these seventy three companies have made a solid long term commitment to continuously improve quality and customer satisfaction steps that are sure to pay dividends not only for award recipients but for our entire industry

1413798 this program is part of our efforts to leave no child inside and give new mexico the nations best outdoor classroom program
1413799 we hope that many teachers will apply for this funding since lack of transportation is the number one barrier to getting more kids into outdoor classrooms
1413800 grants are not awarded on a first come first served basis as in previous years but now are competitive
1413801 the outdoor classroom program at the destination must correlate to classroom study and meet at least one performance standard from a minimum of two benchmarks for one or more content areas

1413807 jimson this is sheer fantasy about the utah quarterback and you know it appalachian state has become so dominant in theres no stopping them so most everyone should go along with them winning another national title what would happen if they beat lsu and lsu runs the table wins the bcs again by winning their last 13 games in a row to do so would appalachian state be considered the true national champion over the entire country its something to think about
1413808 why dont you just admit right now you have lsu playing kansas in the cotton bowl you know youre going to do it lsu kansas in the cotton bowl a tradition since 2009
1413809 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1413810 a national multiple listing service is a waste of time and effort
1413811 the suggestion that a small mls that caters to its unique market by providing the solutions required by its local real estate agents will not survive is unfounded
1413812 a local well run mls that caters to its local market will succeed based on the fact that its members will support it in the example of banks look at local versus regional or national banks local banks play a critical role in this industry
1413813 sure blogging isnt for everyone but for those who excel at it the opportunities are endless what ive learned is that the more honest relevant info we put out for the audience with no strings attached the more business we attract its a powerful online tool that brokers need to tap into if theyre to survive in the future
1413814 elimination of the seller funded down payment assistance interferes with the rights of the homeowner seller
1413815 if a property is market priced and the seller opts to pay all or part of the buyers down payment the result is a reduction in the sellers net proceeds and should be none of the governments business
1413816 the licensed appraiser is the entity that should verify market value not the government
1413817 what i cant figure out is who is objecting and why are there objections to the seller paying the buyers down payment it defies logic market and common sense
1413818 networking sites focused on something other than real estate produce a more diverse group of people with diverse networks themselves this is where clients come from establishing relationships produces referrals and there are so many sites now to find friends with similar interests
1413819 the testers may be overzealous but there still exists massive covert and blatant discrimination on all levels of the housing industry indirect or misdirected displays of discrimination are no excuse double talk use of fuzzy or gray language and terminology to promote acts of discrimination by brokers agents customers or clients is completely out of order will we ever learn

1413822 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commercial banks
1413823 this balance is the result in part of an estimated cumulative budget surplus of about 29 billion from 2005 to 2007 for 2008 gao estimates a budget surplus of between 38 2 billion to 50 3 billion
1413824 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
1413825 look obama is surging omg obamas support is collapsing no wait hes surging again oh no hes collapsing again what happened to that 9 point lead mccains strategy must be working all is lost the end is near i knew we should have nominated hillary
1413826 when you group the tracking poll data into ten day periods it becomes clear that support for the presidential candidates since the end of the primaries has been extremely stable with obama maintaining a modest but consistent lead and that almost all of the day to day movement in the data is simply random noise
1413827 one of those weeks when the country loses 10 iq points

1413829 the real losers in this smart phone battle will most likely be the second tier players who could find themselves increasingly pushed to the sidelines as the two goliaths battle for market dominance
1413830 i had my hands in my pocket standing totally off my guard the next minute this headbutt came from nowhere and struck me right on the lip i had to get two stitches
1413831 it made it worse for me knowing he was a serving police officer a trusted person by the public
1413832 really the moneys not the matter here its the fact the guy can get off with a fiscal fine hes got no criminal record whatsoever and hes back with his police uniform on the next day
1413833 parliament decided that in situations like that the procurator fiscal could look at it take a decision about what the average fine would be and present it to the justice court which is where that case would have gone
1413834 we took the decision that under new provisions it would be appropriate for compensation to be paid to mr cantwell of 250 quickly and efficiently
1413835 the difficulty seems to be the level of crime that is now being diverted from prosecution is causing great concern in particular the level of violent crime which is no longer being prosecuted
1413836 justice has to be available for everyone the accused and victims of crime there has to be a balance struck between those two
1413837 its really a matter for public attention and public debate to decide on how we should deal with violent offenders or offenders of a level above the most minimal offence
1413838 were seeing customer and partner demand for a complete tightly integrated platform that provides true enterprise value by mobilizing business processes and applications
1413839 this is our unwired enterprise vision unleashing the power of information anywhere at anytime from the data center right to the mobile edge including employees and end customers
1413840 we will have to watch over time how it correlates to other ratings and rankings and whether it offers new information or reiterates the existing rankings
1413841 more importantly well have to watch over time to see if its an accurate forecast of exploitability which may prove difficult
1413842 our message is very simple its not complex we are proposing that we come back into session and have an up or down vote on an energy package that includes everything including drilling for additional oil and gas this is not just about oil and gas its about a comprehensive package we have got to get the price of energy down to an affordable level again and we only do that by a comprehensive that covers all of the energy
1413843 our daughter attends college on the other side of the country and we cannot afford the 2 000 airfare to bring her home for the holidays
1413844 i live in an economically depressed rural tenn where the higher food gas costs are dramatically affecting our elderly and young families some people have to drive 35 miles plus to work they are carpooling when they can but some are now making the hard choice of working at barely above min wage and filling the gas tank
1413845 its time for the democrats to listen to the american people and the people are tired of 4 00 gasoline while they turned off the lights and cameras to shut down dissent they started their 5 week vacation i had to cancel mine because i couldnt afford to go anywhere
1413846 enough talk from the d emocrats about tapping our strategic oil reserves and slapping windfall taxes on big oil thats not a solution we need to drill research alternative energy that wont compete for foodstuffs and build more refineries
1413847 i would like to stand with everyone else here and thank every single congressman woman who has stood with and on behalf of the american people its nice to have our voices being heard in the house again pelsoi call congress back now so america can vote for the american energy act you work for the people and we want this passed
1413848 the passion for freedom is a defining aspect of the american character it thrives in the souls of our people and when brought to bear on a common goal it is a formidable force republicans stand with the american people

1413855 these new services are exactly the type of new business models that the commission contemplated when it adopted the encoding rules
1413856 assuring commercial consumer availability of equipment used to access services provided by multichannel video programming distributors
1413857 we are concerned that selectable output control would harm those early adopters whose dtv equipment only has component analog inputs for high definition display placing these consumers at risk of being completely shut off from the high definition content they expect to receive
1413858 it was probably somebodys job because everybody has to be employed
1413859 so there was no need for volunteers to do it
1413860 typically there are not a lot of adults available to teens in the czech republic
1413861 theyre busy or working youths need people who are older than them who care about them spend time with them and are there unconditionally for them
1413862 kids have opportunities today their parents never would have dreamed of
1413863 theyre the first generation thats grown up with freedom so theyre figuring it out on their own because their parents grew up differently
1413864 the rules are difficult to explain to kids without a baseball background
1413865 you have to rely on other people a lot so you feel like youve lost your sense of independence
1413866 i think especially under communism you were very close with your immediate family and you could trust those people but you really just didnt know who else you could trust
1413867 so people are very careful about what they say and how they welcome new people and strangers
1413868 i think the first time we were aware of it we invited a couple over
1413869 when you get into another culture these are the quirks you have to learn
1413870 my own belief is that having the opportunity to serve and an opportunity to volunteer is a way to give back to the community and young people and i think that adds to my quality of life
1413871 its something thats important to me and it brings me satisfaction
1413872 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone
1413873 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1413874 if lawmakers take our funds it will affect our services that we provide police fire roads street improvements
1413875 that shows me theres still some inherent strength in there
1413876 even if it seems as though chinas economic demand run has slowed some those changes at the margins still make them a huge consumer of crude products
1413877 anytime you get that kind of violent price action in a short amount of time it reeks of someone big being in trouble

1413879 there are far right internet pages that we block and of course its also the case in china that some sites are blocked
1413880 were not talking here about internet pages with prosecutable content were talking about amnesty international
1413881 instead of making demands of the chinese side vesper has trivialized and justified chinas behavior
1413882 ive always opposed censorship in china to accuse me of the opposite is unfair wrong and absurd

1413907 the obama campaign has signaled for example through national finance chair penny pritzker that its going to rely more on traditional fund raising techniques from here on out than it did through the primaries
1413908 so their fund raising will be more of a balance between the small donor internet based fund raising and the traditional donor efforts and therefore the new york fund raising community is very important to the obama campaign and that campaign has been playing close attention to that community
1413909 i tease him with his kids you know your dad is like obi wan kenobi
1413910 in my view there is no more important person to our success in new york
1413911 a lot of people looked at his support for barack early in this race as a sign not only of how seriously barack would compete financially in new york but just how substantive of a candidate barack was and is because orin doesnt throw his support lightly
1413912 i maintain that it is a more disgusting form of chewing tobacco
1413913 if we were determinative of the outcome then the outcome would have been different
1413914 prove that as a class we werent as important as people thought we were
1413915 are you bothered by the fact that obama doesnt look like the presidents on our paper money

1413933 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1413934 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1413935 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1413936 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1413937 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1413938 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1413939 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1413940 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1413943 a pilot about a dead model actress whose soul ends up in the body of a brilliant but rather frumpy lawyer
1413944 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed and bragged about supporting those policies more than 90 percent of time the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1413945 mccain has fought one battle after another against lobbyists and special interests
1413946 john mccain has fought for 14 long hard years for reforms that seriously limit lobbyists power he has fought for campaign finance reform limits on gifts and travel from lobbyists and extensive public disclosure of lobbyists activities all of which limit the influence of lobbyists and the companies that hire lobbyists in washington d c
1413947 one thing overlooked in flap over mccain and lobbyists his record on reform
1413948 ten years ago senator john mccain took on the tobacco industry saying he would never back down from legislation to regulate the industry mccains decade of work on tobacco one of the most significant efforts of his congressional career has earned him enmity from the industry and from some fellow republicans over the years
1413949 in 1998 mccain championed anti smoking legislation that faced furious opposition from the tobacco lobby mccain guided the legislation through the senate commerce committee on a 19 1 vote but then the tobacco companies struck back they hired 200 lobbyists and spent 40 million in advertising three times as much as the harry and louise health care reform ads many of the ads attacked mccain by name accusing him of becoming a big government liberal after weeks of bitter debate the bill died on the senate floor
1413950 at a press conference today sen olympia j snowe r maine introduced breakthrough bipartisan consensus prescription drug reimportation legislation the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act with sens byron dorgan d nd john mccain r az ted kennedy d ma tom daschle d sd trent lott r ms and debbie stabenow d mi
1413951 mccain said he wanted the government to be able to negotiate lower drug prices and import cheaper drugs from canada both ideas that were adamantly opposed by industry lobbyists and which ultimately failed
1413952 the most public front was active last week with the senate passing a bill intended to make it easier for cheap generic drugs to come onto the market the bill sponsored by sens charles schumer d n y and john mccain r ariz drew considerable support in congress and strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry
1413953 in 2002 mccain capped his long push for campaign finance reform by passing the mccain feingold act people can argue about the effectiveness of the act but one thing is beyond dispute it was a direct assault on lobbyist power and earned mccain undying enmity among many important parts of the republican coalition who felt their soft money influence was being diminished
1413954 exposed billions of dollars of waste and layers of contracting irregularity
1413955 in 2004 mccain launched a frontal assault on the leasing contract the pentagon had signed with boeing for aerial refueling tankers mccains investigation exposed billions of dollars of waste and layers of contracting irregularity
1413956 in 2005 mccain led the congressional investigation into the behavior of the lobbyist jack abramoff the investigation was exceedingly unpleasant for republicans because it exposed shocking misbehavior by important conservative activists
1413957 americans are right to be offended when extravagant ceo salaries and severance deals bear no relation to their companys success or shareholders wishes as president john mccain will see that wrongdoing of this kind is called to account by federal prosecutors under his reforms all aspects of a ceos pay including severance arrangements must be approved by shareholders
1413958 a leader we can believe in to help small businesses
1413959 the task force will aggressively investigate potential criminal wrongdoing in the mortgage industry and bring to justice any who violated the law the doj task force will offer assistance to state attorney generals who are investigating abusive lending practices
1413960 congress already has several investigations underway to examine this kind of wagering in our energy markets unrelated to any kind of productive commerce because it can distort the market drive prices beyond rational limits and put the investments and pensions of millions of americans at risk john mccain believes that where we find abuses they need to be swiftly punished to make sure it never happens again we must reform the laws and regulations governing the oil futures market so that they are just as clear and effective as the rules applied to stocks bonds and other financial instruments
1413961 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence

1414109 vroeger had ik nog heel weinig geduld voor het verschonen van luiers
1414110 laatst werd ik voor het blok gezet tess was even boodschapjes doen en toen begon het opeens een bak te stinken in huis dat kon alleen maar thomas zijn ik heb me er dus maar weer eens aan gewaagd en eigenlijk ging het weer vanzelf
1414111 het gaat erg goed ik heb er wel een paar rimpels bij van de lange nachten
1414112 de eerste paar weken was thomas echt vijf keer per nacht wakker maar nu gaat het fantastisch
1414113 ik heb nog geen filet americain gemaakt van wat daar beneden bij me zit dat moet ik nog laten doen
1414114 tess heeft net een waanzinnige bevalling achter de rug met een keizersnee en dat heb ik dus van heel dichtbij meegemaakt dan zou een sterilisatie geen moeite meer moeten kosten maar ik schijt in mijn broek ik vind het h lemaal niks
1414115 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1414116 the biggest lesson once again for the rest of the world the us is not prepared to respect any ruling when that ruling is not in their favour and that for me is like the law of the jungle once again if we dont respect the international legislation then how can we ask other countries to do so
1414117 this will be good for them i expect the brewers to bond over this and come out of it stronger
1414118 these things happen all the time during a season you just never see them
1414119 that was ridiculous these guys bonds kent fielder parra whoever whoever need to be more professional we all know theyre competitors and all that but theyre tearing their team apart by allowing its tectonic divisions to be displayed in public
1414120 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1414121 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1414122 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1414123 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1414124 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1414125 i think when i decide it will give me a peace of mind to know that this is where i want to be
1414126 when i wake up one day say that this is where i want to go then thats when it will happen
1414127 my dad didnt even know i was going to commit that day
1414128 i wanted to get it done that way i could put all my focus onto working on my grades and not stressing over which college am i going to choose basically just take some of the pressure off me
1414129 i love the coaches and i love the atmosphere just the tradition of the campus that goes on i really like the coachs style of play
1414130 but i think in the end i still would have chosen usc
1414131 im glad i decided early but if i wouldnt have known and if there wasnt that other girl that was going for this scholarship i probably would have waited it out
1414132 every coach probably wants you to commit as soon as possible to know that their school is favored so theres pressure but my mothers a very strong woman and she liked to alleviate that pressure
1414133 she said to just wait until you believe that its absolutely the thing you want
1414134 were not going to commit until we see all the schools so that you know this is the best choice for you

1414147 we are still negotiating a controversial fta with the european union and a regional trade deal among ourselves we havent even begun to prepare our regional negotiating framework or undertake social impact assessments or reviews of pacific legislation that could be affected by a new fta with australia and new zealand
1414148 negotiations havent even begun and the australians are splitting the region by refusing to support a regional negotiating office and by holding out carrots like new workers schemes to gain support from individual pacific countries
1414149 it would be unfortunate if australia and nz were to use their position as key aid donor countries for the region to secure their own trade interests in any fta negotiations
1414150 we need to use international trade to enhance our development opportunities in the pacific

1414194 oh so and so is going to march with them that means he or she is going to be good or suck wind
1414195 we lost three games by a total of four runs so we played well
1414196 the bats didnt quite work as well as we had hoped but defensively i thought we were very strong and our pitching was excellent
1414197 she cracked one down the left field line and it was foul by about an inch and a half
1414198 then the umpire called her out on strikes on the next pitch
1414199 we had a shot to win it and we actually thought we did win it but for about a couple of inches
1414200 our pitching was just outstanding and we made some really key plays defensively
1414201 sheila thul had some great catches out in centre and i picked a girl off of second the bats came alive a bit shirley johnson was hitting the ball really well

1414203 its refreshing to see so many college presidents athletic directors and coaches standing up for whats best for their institutions sports programs and student athletes

1414206 student athletes competing in ncaa sporting events should not be associated with the very product that causes them the most harm and is clearly not in their best interests
1414207 we were pretty happy to win two of the three
1414208 in the tiebreaker game we got off to a bad start in the first inning and we just couldnt quite claw our way back into the game
1414209 had we not gotten off to a bad start i think we could have beaten them we got four runs in the bottom of our first inning and then they got five runs on three uncharacteristic errors then we just couldnt battle back
1414210 theres a lot of competition but i thought it would be fun at the same time
1414211 i have the 300 metre tuesday so im looking forward to that too

1414386 our performance in mathematics and science subjects is dismal and we continue to be faced by inadequate infrastructure poor and inefficient administration in some provinces and disaffected and demotivated teachers
1414387 the curriculum changes have been a severely disruptive yet necessary process
1414388 all these challenges have an impact on our ability to ensure that learners emerge from our schools ready and able to grapple with university level study
1414389 the inadequate responsiveness of higher education adds to this mix of problems and results in the revolving door syndrome of access and failure that we find in all our universities
1414390 south africa should not repeat the history of other systems that have taken decades to overcome discrimination and disadvantage
1414391 these values are absent in many of our educational institutions students and staff should know that when they enter our universities and schools they enter places where principles and values exist in mission statements and in practice and that authorities will act strongly if there is a breach

1414395 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
1414396 we have got to create this new mechanism to be able to turn the aids vaccine into a normal product development initiative so that every time there a failure it doesnt raise the question of whether this is the end of the line
1414397 strong scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
1414398 before vaccines go into efficacy trials they need to go through a set of screenings to look at evidence they are significantly better
1414399 we are pushing a whole new generation of vectors we have got candidates coming down the pipeline on that

1414459 grieving is all a part of what were supposed to do when tragedy strikes it is a part of our being human that triggers this response how we cope is not entirely left to us to decide there are caring people in the world even those who you may have thought didnt care about you are only just around the corner and they will come to you and help you through your pain what is important for all of us to remember in every day of our lives is the value our loved ones left behind for others who will never forget their actions and deeds if we can associate our emotions to the wonderful legacies that were created that in itself gives us the strength to fight our demons and restore some normality back into our lives the pain we feel inside is brought on by sudden impact of loss it is natural though hard to wean out of system because we are in the transition stage of mourning we have to embrace our emotions positively and ask ourselves where we can go from here create a road map and plot out your thoughts or simply write them down cross off what you were able to achieve day by day and soon youll notice that in your personal strength you have the will amp courage to move on interact with others do not corner yourself and lock the world out from your life be flexible and look at what you can contribute to others who need support if youre online amp reading this use the internet and eek out resources that will drive your passion forward within no time to next youll be amazed at how much of you the world needs as a starter i will recommend and your loved ones will be guiding you through every decision you make god bless

1414464 it did not look like it was a professional nhs thing he had made it out of metal and there were a few paint splodges on it
1414465 i did not know what to think really but i knew it was the only hope it was touch and go and i went along with it

1414474 there is no missile in development or in any air forces inventory that can even come close to matching what the aim 120d can do
1414475 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1414476 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1414477 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1414478 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1414479 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1414480 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1414481 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1414482 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1414483 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1414484 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1414485 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1414486 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1414487 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1414488 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1414489 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1414490 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1414491 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1414492 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1414493 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1414494 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1414495 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1414496 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1414497 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1414498 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1414499 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1414500 was sent to new york on a project for the book

1414524 most of the kids had never heard of or read any shakespeare but four years ago some of the children read one of the plays and wanted to put on their own production of it our company grew out of that
1414525 on one level the plays are just poetry turned into a story that can be acted out kids respond really well to hearing poetry read we try to break down the action so everyone understands whats happening whos in charge who wants something and who doesnt we cast carefully and we try to encourage the kids to read outside of our rehearsals we look for a lot of interest and influence from the families to make that happen
1414526 once the production gets rolling and everyone knows what theyre supposed to be doing the kids really run the show in the beginning we didnt do much in the way of sets and lighting now were moving to more theatrical productions
1414527 costumes are the responsibility of the families since we dont charge any sort of tuition for the children to participate so far its working

1414601 to really get a significant impact you are going to have to use purposely grown energy crops
1414602 its really a timing issue with improvements in technology and economics these things will be real in the very near future
1414603 we need energy crops to get the industry to scale

1414617 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough yes it was probably too late i imagine for cheney im not sure it was too late for bush
1414618 the white house then buried the habbush report they instructed the british that they were no longer interested in keeping the channel open
1414619 the brits wanted to avoid war which was what was driving them bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1414620 if these allegations are true it immediately raises the question of why tony blair was so determined to stick with george bush the case for a proper inquiry such as followed the falklands war gets stronger and stronger
1414621 even five years later richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationary on which the assignment was written
1414622 the guys from the office were just barraging us in the period this was different this was creating a deception
1414623 there was no such order from the white house to me or to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1414624 you should have lots of members when the iraq war vets start to come home and to eventually not be afraid to tell what they know some of them will be slower than others to acknowledge that theyve been the peons of an ungrateful government and for the most part a totally biased population except for those of us who have seen through this sham of a war from the get go but once the flood gates are opened nothing can stop them they will be grateful for a place to be recognized and believed john

1414636 daarom praten wij spanjaarden altijd zo hard dat is om boven het vuurwerk uit te komen
1414637 kita membenarkan memang ada kata kata telanjang seperti itu tapi kita tidak bermaksud melecehkan kok hanya guyon
1414638 kita hanya guyon karena kita menilai dia sendiri yang berpenampilan seronok dan jogetnya di meja bukan di panggung
1414639 mungkin hipmi dan pengusaha pengusaha lainnya kapok ngundang dewi persik karena kejadian kemarin
1414640 kalau colombus bisa menemukan amerika masak aku enggak bisa menemukan alamat rumah tante kamu yang cuma di daerah cinere

1414645 seru saja melihat orang saling memukul mobil meledak atau buaya memakan zebra rasanya adrenalin jadi ikut terpacu
1414646 masa sih mungkin ini sudah jadi mindset di kepala lelaki dari zaman dulu ya perempuan selalu rapi lelaki yang sembarangan kalau lelaki yang rapi jadi berkesan kecewek cewekan makanya lelaki pilih yang serba berantakan dan sembarangan biar berkesan lelaki banget
1414647 asyik mengingat skor pertandingan untuk bahan obrolan dengan teman teman kalau ulangtahun pacar sih sebenarnya ingat cuma kadang pas dekat harinya jadi lupa tapi enggak bermaksud melupakan lho

1414661 the u s economic expansion may slow to the weakest pace in six years in the fourth quarter after the impact of federal tax rebates fades
1414662 at the same time the royal bank of scotland headlined warnings of a global crash the royal bank of scotland has advised clients to brace for a full fledged crash in global stock and credit markets over the next three months as inflation paralyzes the major central banks the fed is in panic mode the massive credibility chasms down which the fed and maybe even the ecb will plummet when they fail to hike rates in the face of higher inflation will combine to give us a big sell off in risky assets the bank said lastly barclays capital warned clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm on july 2 u s treasury secretary henry paulsons european speech was covered live on cspan he gave considerable lip service to what would happen if a number of u s banks were to fail including even a major u s bank no bank names were mentioned but the fact that he brought it up indicates that the europeans are very concerned about it
1414663 anyone who is paying attention would have seen the mess that americas big three auto makers are in consider this little fun fact as of this last friday the market capitalization of general motors gm was just over 5 billion thats all toyota has about 25 times that so are several other healthy auto makers and they all know that times are tough yet gm expects sales to pick up later this year but consider that 5 billion its cheap yet no one is touching gm no one wants to buy it even to take it apart and shut it down why every single asset gm has is pledged multiple times as collateral for loans that it cannot repay while it is losing 41 billion per year
1414664 heres the final hint for anyone still in denial as of june 30th gm slipped beneath 20 billion in remaining cash assets but is burning 17 billion per year in other words gm probably has just 9 to15 months of life left at the most no one will be able to stop it and gm will be history and the lenders will still only get pennies on the dollar for each dollar they loaned ford and chrysler are in similar situations if the economic system implodes the big three will cease to exist
1414665 freddie mac and fannie mae plunged in new york trading and their credit default swaps rose as concerns grew the two largest u s mortgage finance companies may need to raise more capital to overcome writedowns and satisfy new accounting rules
1414666 the biggest provider of financing for u s home loans wont have enough capital to weather the worst housing slump since the great depression the companys credit default swaps show traders are treating the aaa rated debt as if it were five steps lower fannie mae shares tumbled 13 percent yesterday in new york to the lowest level in almost 14 years chances are increasing that the u s may need to bail out fannie mae and the smaller freddie mac
1414667 bonds sold by u s municipal borrowers with rates set through periodic auctions failed to attract enough buyers as banks including goldman sachs group inc and citigroup inc that run the bidding wont commit their own capital to the debt
1414668 what began three weeks ago with too few bidders for auction rate debt backed by relatively small entities such as georgetown university and nevada power has widened in recent days to include large issues of state governments such as new york states dormitory authority
1414669 this year both media and online leaders are grappling with the internets increasing fragmentation
1414670 at the same time the barons of old line newspapers and broadcast tv seem to have realized its pointless to keep fighting the shift online but theyre still unsure how to embrace it and theyre struggling to attract new online users just to survive the flagging economy slowing consumer spending and costlier capital on wall street will only add to any gloom and may prevent the summit from living up to its reputation as an incubator for big deals
1414671 i saw something big happening in the past 18 months on the campaign trail i was encouraged that we are capable of waking up and doing the right thing i have literally met thousands of high school and college kids who are quite willing to accept the challenge and responsibility of a free society and reject the cradle to grave welfare that is promised them by so many do good politicians
1414672 the real problem is the government cant provide the safety and economic security that it claims the so called good that government claims it can deliver is always achieved at the expense of someone elses freedom its a failed system and the young people know it restoring a free society doesnt eliminate the need to get our house in order and to pay for the extravagant spending but the pain would not be long lasting actually it would since government spending pervades every aspect of the economy a cut off of this improper flow of funds and benefits will take years of pain and economic dislocation to work out if we did the right things and best of all the empire would have to end for financial reasons true our wars would stop the attack on civil liberties would cease and prosperity would return the wars would stop right now if people had to pay for them that is why they use deficit spending to shield people from having to pay for foreign aid and wars of intervention the choices are clear it shouldnt be difficult but the big event now unfolding gives us a great opportunity to reverse the tide and resume the truly great american revolution started in 1776 opportunity knocks in spite of the urgency and the dangers we face
1414673 the culmination of 40 years of gradual but consistent distortion of economic statistics have come home to roost and explain much of our current morass
1414674 the long campaign of statistical massage began in the kennedy administration
1414675 president lyndon johnson a clever political dealmaker came up with the concept for the unified budget for the 1969 fiscal year as he was about to finish his final year in office
1414676 not to be outdone by prior administrations president nixon requested that fed chairman arthur burns develop the concept of core inflation statistics this was invented by others not nixon and presented to nixon as a
1414677 the reagan administration added a critical element to the inflation manipulation game when they convinced the bureau of labor statistics bls in 1983 that housing inflation was overstating the cpi
1414678 the changes proposed by the boskin commission were not implemented until 1996 under president clinton and with the support of fed chairman alan greenspan
1414679 economic statistician john williams of www shadowstats com tracks the pre clinton era cpi on his website and is frequently quoted regarding inflation statistics if you were to peel back changes that were made in the cpi going back to the carter years youd see that the cpi would now be 3 5 to 4 higher said williams phillips notes that because of lost cpi increases social security checks would be 70 higher than they are currently this would certainly have made a difference for many seniors relying on social security who have seen devastating declines in their lifestyles during the past two decades
1414680 2 wont do it 10 wont do it youve got to have a flat out majority to stop the government from buying votes with benefits
1414681 tidak ada kebijakan dari dpd untuk tidak mencalonkan anggota dprd penerima dana bansos red itu pernyataan pak agung laksono
1414682 saya rasa kalau statusnya saksi bisa bisa aja apalagi yang banyak berbuat untuk masyarakat terkecuali yang sudah berkekuatan hukum tetap ya tidak boleh
1414683 sampai hari ini pak setia budi tersangka korupsi bansos red belum terlihat tanda tanda mencalonkan lagi beliau pernah bilang tak akan mencalonkan di kukar maupun di tingkat satu dprd kaltim
1414684 saya rasa kekhawatiran kearah itu tidak ada kami tidak takut ada yang sampai pindah partai yakin bahwa kader golkar yang ada sekarang ini loyal terhadap partainya kalaupun tidak dicalonkan sekalipun mereka masih solid di golkar
1414685 sekarang ini banyak anggota dewan yang reses mulai hari ini kemarin red sampai tanggal 10 agustus 2008 memang ada yang datang tapi hanya beberapa orang saja

1414687 kalau saya tahu itu duit bansos ya ndak saya terima blangko yang saya tanda tangani bunyinya uang sumbangan transportasi ya kita terima
1414688 the industry is reaching a point where delivering an acceptable level of security today is beyond what one company can do alone wrote microsofts andrew cushman in the blogs inaugural post
1414689 theres real merit in the clich it takes a village
1414690 think of it as community based defense where we commit our skills and strengths to defend beyond our boundaries to protect our common customers
1414691 you cant put a grade on products and services from a security standpoint
1414692 the best thing you can do is get the information out
1414693 theres definitely no end point to security so i think that whatever is done to foster collaboration is a step in the right direction
1414694 were launching two additional cloud computing centers and one of them is going to be an extremely large cloud computing center the largest that weve launched to date
1414695 both new facilities are examples of how were investing hundreds of millions of dollars to create extremely efficient datacenters based on cloud technologies and our enterprise architecture which weve instantiated in other cloud computing efforts
1414696 from a consumer perspective looking at it from the different use cases that are coming about you see the growth of these huge web 2 0 applications out there as well as the emergence of a huge mobile user base these applications require large amounts of compute resources just to handle the number of users because with the web 2 0 phenomenon people are actually contributing content back to these sites
1414697 its not to say that everybody is going to be exactly like youtube but even with a bank a user consuming your service could be a person standing on the side of the street hitting the refresh button on their stock ticker or account balance or whatever
1414698 thats going to create huge demand on the systems that are running these applications so it isnt just about back end data processing we want to talk about supporting lots of different types of workloads both user based workloads and back end based workloads
1414699 the thing thats really compelling about the cloud model when its used either internally or externally is that there are levels of efficiency that one is able to get that you just cant get with conventional data centers over time even internal datacenters will migrate more and more to a cloud approach where they adopt cloud principles such as virtualization
1414700 the software in these cloud datacenters is composed of a number of our tivoli products including a request driven provisioning product we also use a lot of xen but were able to use other virtualization technologies such as vmware too
1414701 customers arent going to be ripping out datacenters and replacing them with cloud centers overnight this is going to be a gradual process
1414702 its going to be a hybrid model with both internal and external clouds
1414703 create s a new opportunity to shape the relationship between those who use it services and those who sell them
1414704 obviously there are the early adopters who are out there playing with it right now but most of the world is trying to figure out what to do with it what it means what the value to them is going to be
1414705 at share were trying to introduce the technology the options get people into that planning phase get them better able to understand what it is theyre talking about
1414706 the idea of bigger clouds that transcend an individual organizations boundaries and kind of go to this notion of true utility computing is probably still a little further out
1414707 right now were trying to bring the discussion into the share audience start to expose people to what its all about get them prepared for when the cios says i want my own cloud because she read about it in an airline magazine or something like that

1414714 we went through 26 days where we saw his hands and feet turn black as the gangrene set in he lost his kidney function and his liver function and had 10 hours of grand mal seizures and to think that all this could have been prevented with a vaccine that we just didnt know about thats why its so important to get the message out now
1414715 in the first update of its recommendations for prostate cancer screening in five years the panel that sets government policy on preventive medicine said that the evidence that the test reduces the cancers death toll is too uncertain to endorse routine use for men at any age and that the potential harm clearly outweighs any benefits for men age 75 and older
1414716 of course i will be proud of you i always am
1414717 now about that other thing your bicycle antics lets get that over with shall we

1414734 we are imperfect beings stumbling through the world weve created as best we can
1414735 we are no more than an amalgamation of scars our beauty and strengths being discovered and displayed by how well we bloom and drink full this life in spite of them
1414736 i know where i dont want to be and who i dont want to be that helps

1414754 today august 1 2008 was to have been the day imam muhammad masood was sentenced to probation for visa fraud convictions followed soon by his voluntary departure from the country
1414755 instead the former spiritual leader of the islamic center of new englands sharon mosque is awaiting a late september court date as his attorneys try to work out a deal with government lawyers to keep him out of jail between his sentencing and his departure
1414756 the legal battle over the terms of his exit is spelled out in the latest documents filed at u s district court in boston
1414757 in a joint motion filed july 24 imam masoods criminal attorney norman zalkind of boston and justice department lawyers asked for a delay until sept 17 or later because its still not clear whether immigration and customs enforcement ice will agree to let the imam stay free on bail until he boards a plane out of the u s
1414758 imam masood pleaded guilty to five counts of visa fraud in february in a deal that would put him on probation until his deportation was settled his attorneys immigration lawyer william joyce of duxbury and zalkind now say hes ready to go without a court fight probably to his native pakistan
1414759 yes you can quote me see the story put on by us atty for sd of ny this very morning which is all baloney it spilled the forbidden beans i disclosed that she was in kabul this whole story that aafia siddiqui tried to shoot fbi agents is sheer fabrication look up the press release from us south dist attorney ny that they issued as afterthought 6 hrs ago after i caught them with their panties down fbi agents shots her to disable kill her so that truth is reconstructed remember law will accept the impossible not the improbable
1414760 fbi visiting the darkness prison and putting their rifles near the curtain for gods sake that is improbable nonsense

1414788 versluis and uyttenbroek provide an almost scientific anthropological record of peoples attempts to distinguish themselves from others by assuming a group identity the apparent contradiction between individuality and uniformity is however taken to such extremes in their arresting objective looking photographic viewpoint and stylistic analysis
1414789 the tattoo section shows that even when we think of the most individualistic fashions having someone draw on your body the individuals are clearly doing something what other individuals are doing and not being different or unique our efforts to be individuals are ultimately in vain
1414790 the ultimate aim of all commercial communication is to spread ideas that elicit a behavioural response
1414791 but i just oppose those who are proud of their country american
1414792 starbucks global purchases of fair trade certified coffee totaled 11 5 million pounds in fiscal 2005 making it the largest purchaser of fair trade certified coffee in north america
1414793 in addition to paying premium prices for all of our coffees our investment in social development projects and providing access to affordable loans in coffee growing regions has been recognized for its leadership within the industry
1414794 we have heard from a number of sources that actually starbucks was involved in alerting the u
1414795 ethiopian coffee farmers often collect about 10 percent of the profits from these coffees the rest goes to the coffee industry players that can control the retail price the international importers distributors and roasters like starbucks
1414796 starbucks has engaged in some positive initial steps in helping coffee farmers living in poverty i dont understand why they wont take the next step and come to the table to discuss ethiopias proposal in good faith
1414797 securing the trademark for its sidamo harar and yirgacheffe coffee beans could have allowed the country to increase its negotiation leverage through control of the names and ultimately derive a greater share of the retail price in the global market
1414798 when producers can grow and prosper by not only improving production and quality but also by building up the value of their intellectual property portfolios then everybody in the coffee industry including partners in retail and distribution as well as consumers reap benefits
1414799 stronger negotiating power would enable millions of coffee farmers and traders to prosper and invest in the future of these fine coffees
1414800 the wto controls a huge amount of the profit trade and a change needs to be made in international trade laws the price we farmers receive is very low and its lower because of unfair trade laws
1414801 this film highlights the vulnerability of coffee farmers and the disconnect that exists between poor farmers and huge profits oxfam seeks to correct the imbalances of power at the root of unfair trade
1414802 we have never filed an opposition to the ethiopian governments trademark application nor claimed ownership to any regional names used to describe the origin of our coffees
1414803 we have not been involved in trying to block ethiopias attempts we did not get the nca involved in fact it was the other way around they were the ones who contacted us on this
1414804 were trademarks to be implemented roasters might shy away from buying the coffees for fear of becoming embroiled in complicated legal disputes or worse they may buy the coffees and just market them without the trademarked names letting the high quality beans go to market without a geographic identification would completely undermine the value of the brand
1414805 the only way this statement could be accurate is if ethiopia completely mismanages the trademarks once they have been acquired and i would hope that starbucks is not assuming that ethiopia is not capable of managing the intellectual property assets related to one of its most important exports
1414806 is all for ethiopia protecting its regional names just not through trademark
1414807 people are so hooked on coffee that they are not going to be affected by something that is happening so far away the only people protesting starbucks are a minority of activists everyone else just thinks about their own problems
1414808 they treat their employees better than most corporate companies and they give a lot back to the community
1414809 the coffee producers should band together to control the supply of coffee in the international market thereby enabling themselves to dictate their own terms similar to how oil producing countries manipulate the price of oil by reducing or increasing production amp supply
1414810 while oil is a resource only few countries are endowed with almost anybody can grow coffee
1414811 we see liquor stores as symbols of oppression of poverty lack of ownership of our communities and most importantly racism
1414812 researchers at the johns hopkins school of public health have shown that predominantly black low income neighborhoods in baltimore were eight times more likely to have carry out liquor stores than white or racially integrated neighborhoods

1414822 im a fan of your doryns dish site i enjoy visiting it every morning before diving into the days work
1414823 i just stumbled upon your blog and have to ask are you my long lost twin
1414824 i found your website doryns dish recently and ive really enjoyed reading through it even though im a male in my mid 20s pretty clearly outside your general target audience ive found a lot of interesting things to read there
1414825 an african therefore is one who by accident of history and the reality of geography is wedded to the african continent a leading advocate of this concept was kwame nkrumah
1414826 consisting of people of african origin living outside the continent irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the african union
1414827 a political movement initiated by peoples of african descent in the americas and later taken over by continental africans which aims to liberate all africans and people of african descent from the shackles of political economic cultural and intellectual domination
1414828 many of them have made no small contribution to the cause of african freedom names which spring immediately to mind in this connection are those of marcus garvey and w e b dubois long before many of us were even conscious of our own degradation these men fought for african national and racial equality
1414829 while the oau helped speed the independence of african nations it did not reach out to the african diaspora in a meaningful way
1414830 it began the long awaited outreach to the african diaspora
1414831 invite and encourage the full participation of the african diaspora as an important part of our continent in the building of the african union
1414832 existing institutions and organizations in the diaspora should be integrated with the au a pan african parliamentary union between the pap and the us congressional black caucus cbc would be one such innovation
1414833 contribute to the principles policies and programs of the union
1414834 even at the launch of the general assembly of the ecosocc the few diaspora persons there were mere observers
1414835 towards the realization of a united and integrated africa and its diaspora
1414836 a shared vision of sustainable development for both the african continent and the millions of people around the world who share an african heritage
1414837 the african diaspora can play a part in enhancing africas role in the world by promoting the development of the continent
1414838 long may the links between africa and the peoples of african descent continue to hold us together in fraternity now that we in africa are marching towards the complete emancipation of this continent our independent status will help in no small measure their efforts to attain full human rights and human dignity as citizens of their country
1414839 we in america and elsewhere are your long lost brothers and sisters and i am here only to remind you that our problems are your problems
1414840 since the 22 million of us were originally africans who are now in america not by choice but only by a cruel accident in our history we strongly believe that african problems are our problems and our problems are african problems
1414841 indeed the activities and challenges of both continental africans and africans in diaspora continued to impact upon each other with history as a common reference point those transported across the atlantic began as second class citizens in their new abode just as the establishment of the colonial order of the african continent relegated their brothers to the same status on the continent hence the quest for freedom and social emancipation became a shared concern africans on both sides of the atlantic divide felt the impact of vestigial discrimination in the aftermath of the abolition of the slave trade and the onset of the twentieth century 9

1414844 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
1414845 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions
1414846 if you can think of an emotion being communicated by the face as a kind of signal you can understand that we can amplify that signal into what was almost a caricature to see if we get the proper effect
1414847 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1414848 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1414849 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1414850 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1414851 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1414852 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them

1414878 to empower children with hearing loss and other communicative disorders to flourish
1414879 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all
1414880 these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1414881 we as a community are unambiguous in our condemnation of these actions let me be clear this is not protest this is terrorism
1414882 prior to that the vast majority of actions taken were against institutions break into the lab steal the animals trash the facility
1414883 more recently however theyve become much more personal attacking the researchers at their homes california seems to be the focus of this activity right now but not the only focus
1414884 i think its a form of domestic terrorism intended to intimidate people
1414885 these are incidents that could have killed someone they are obviously intended to prevent researchers from pursuing the advancement of knowledge they are a serious attack on academic freedom
1414886 preach this we respect all living things and then they do that with children in the house
1414887 the inconvenience and the suffering of any children or any family members pales in comparison to the suffering and oppression that goes on in these animal laboratories

1414889 for rational people this violence is not the way you exercise your opinions in a democratic society
1414890 we support our colleagues in the sciences and the academic freedom that goes along with being a professor
1414891 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1414892 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1414893 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance
1414894 the brain has been mysterious for a long time and were just starting to pick away at it
1414895 in 150 odd years weve learned a lot about how hormones work and the science we do here is a modest and gentle nudge toward extending the field
1414896 estrogens are typically synthesized in the cell bodies of specialized cells in the ovaries testes adipose tissue and neurons these modes of estrogen delivery underlie many but not all of the multiple actions of estrogens on the brain
1414897 all songbirds make high levels of estrogen in their brains
1414898 the parts of the brain that make estrogen are often the very same parts that show dramatic cycles in size at times some songbirds even almost double the size of particular parts of their brain
1414899 our research is basic in nature and not clinically applied we want to understand the phenomenon and how this is working we know it exists but now we need to know what it does where it exists and how it affects behavior
1414900 we may be able to understand how hormones regulate the process of learning and memory which is relevant to alzheimers stroke and perhaps even parkinsons

1414931 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
1414932 we have got to create this new mechanism to be able to turn the aids vaccine into a normal product development initiative so that every time there a failure it doesnt raise the question of whether this is the end of the line
1414933 strong scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
1414934 before vaccines go into efficacy trials they need to go through a set of screenings to look at evidence they are significantly better

1415000 two more anthrax letters bearing the same trenton postmark were dated
1415001 bruce e ivins the army scientist who killed himself last week after learning that he was likely to be charged in the anthrax letter attacks of 2001 was largely circumstantial and a grand jury in washington was planning to hear several more weeks of testimony before issuing an indictment a person who has been briefed on the investigation said on sunday
1415002 if you go back to the statement by her boyfriend above and read the full article he also says of duley
1415003 shell soon reveal what many wouldnt because they didnt want to be involved with it
1415004 the top suspect in the 2001 anthrax attacks was obsessed with a sorority that sat less than 100 yards away from a new jersey mailbox where the toxin laced letters were sent authorities said monday
1415005 the mailbox just off the campus of princeton university where the letters were mailed sits about 100 yards away from where the colleges kappa kappa gamma chapter stores its rush materials initiation robes and other property sorority members do not live there and the kappa chapter at princeton does not provide a house for the women
1415006 hates ever had any contact with the suspect meaning he never talked to them so does the fbi use this to connect dr ivins to the mailbox where the anthrax letters were sent b when jean duley stated that dr ivins had a history of taking revenge against people that slighted him especially women that means that the fbi told duley about this artificial connection now why would they do that if not to frighten this woman into filing the restraining order 2
1415007 in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 anthrax attacks al qaeda but investigators ruled that out the daily news has learned it is hard to imagine that a prosecution based on this evidence would have produced a guilty verdict but more importantly it seems that those people running it are purposefully manipulating the public appearance of his guilt by intentionally glossing over the serious problems with the investigation that begs the next question why why is the fbi with full cooperation for them msm and the ap attempting to fix this problems of this investigation rather than solve the mystery of who sent the anthrax in the first place one would think that issues of public safety would come into play at some point but perhaps now that the man has been driven to commit suicide
1415008 whatever you think is best i will certainly always do
1415009 this wont be simply a matter of drought busters driving around the city trying to monitor behavior
1415010 they will receive many calls and be able do their job much more efficiently because the populace will participate in this entire process

1415015 the government has rushed in here with uncorroborated unsubstantiated allegations of a murder
1415016 there has been a book written about this wonderful insider deal anthrax vaccine 1 and the following is part of a teaser from a site selling that book
1415017 is the anthrax vaccine as bad as people say it is no its worse says author lt col thomas s heemstra author of anthrax a deadly shot in the dark unmasking the truth behind a deadly vaccine

1415019 project biosheild program theyve already used it on every us soldier and results have been despicably devastating and in a real court of law constitute nothing less than criminal negligence and intent to harm and all of it just to make a buck
1415020 lab specimens of anthrax spores ebola virus and other pathogens disappeared from the armys biological warfare research facility in the early 1990s during a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival scientists there documents from an internal army inquiry show
1415021 anyway this same dr zack worked for gilead sciences in 2000 this is the same gilead sciences that invented tamiflu which has become popular and profitable after the bird flu scare this is the same gilead sciences that makes popular medicines treating aids that many people believe was developed in american military laboratories and who owns gilead sciences a major stockholder is none other than neocon donald rumsfeld who at one time was its ceo also tony blair of england who joined bush in the invasions of afghanistan and iraq and tom brokaw who had received one of the anthrax letters and another major shareholder is none other than neocon cindy mccain possibly the next first lady of the us
1415022 karl another great hit thanks again remember the neocon gwb insider jerome hauer hes the guy who was spreading the word to other administration insiders to start taking the cipro drug just prior to the anthrax mailouts
1415023 do not judge by appearances but judge with right judgment
1415024 for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged
1415025 if you judge people in a certain way with certain rules and then you inevitably break those rules yourself people will judge you the same way you judged them if you judge people in and with grace then people will judge you in and with grace
1415026 the adoption of humanity and creation into the life of the triune god in jesus regardless of our rule breaking or rule keeping
1415027 on the basis of the eternal will of god we have to think of every human being even the oddest most villainous or miserable as one to whom jesus christ is brother and god is father and we have to deal with him on this assumption if the other person knows that already then we have to strengthen him in that knowledge if he does not know it yet or no longer knows it our business is to transmit this knowledge to him on the basis of the knowledge of the humanity of god no other attitude to any kind of fellow man is possible it is identical with the practical acknowledgement of his human rights and his human dignity to deny it to him would be for us to renounce having jesus christ as brother and god as father
1415028 why are you being so extremely difficult thats not who you really are and we both know it jesus christ lives in you be that
1415029 i know the real you and you are not this extremely difficult person in jesus christ who lives in you good gravy the sooner you begin embracing that fact the sooner you will stop creating misery for yourself and others now change your mind and believe the good news before i have to restrain you in love so you dont hurt anyone else including yourself until you can see jesus more clearly
1415030 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1415031 if there is a subtle shift in the risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1415032 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting
1415033 the blogs were a bit out of control were very mindful of the media coverage and blogs in controlling misinformation all i can say is were going to continue to stay on top of it the misinformation that came out over the weekend fed a lot of depositors fears
1415034 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months but again its a safe banking system a sound banking system our regulators are on top of it this is a very manageable situation
1415035 i dont know that that would be grounds for a mistrial
1415036 the verdict that matters most has already been delivered this trial was a betrayal of american values and will rightly be seen as illegitimate by the rest of the world
1415037 but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me
1415038 a persuasion moral conviction of religious truth or the truthfulness of god or a religious teacher especially reliance upon christ for salvation and constancy in such profession
1415039 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith
1415040 it is a great thing to see physical pluck and greater still to see moral pluck but the greatest to see of all is spiritual pluck to see a man who will stand true to the integrity of jesus christ no matter what he is going through
1415041 sticks and stones may break my bones bur words can never hurt me
1415042 i just dont know jonathan sometimes i feel like you dont want me to feel any emotions if you wanted to be with someone with no emotions you might as well should of gone with a guy because every woman is emotional at some point in their life

1415044 unfortunately there are elements within the establishment in pakistan who do not see things as we see them and who perhaps are not opting for a life that the absolute majority of our people seek and are working for
1415045 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
1415046 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
1415047 after coming so close last season and seeing the tremendous response towards the event there was no doubt in our mind that we were going to take another crack at breaking the world record this season
1415048 we still have 38 more days until the end of the season so theres no need to worry because theres still plenty of time to get salute to procrastination night planned
1415049 38 days is still a long time away i mean if you break it down you could play one world cup four world series nine u s open golf tournaments and 38 super bowls during that period when the time comes well lock ourselves in a room turn off all televisions and radios drink lots of coffee and pull an all nighter to come up with a promotion which will be just good enough for us to earn a passing grade from our fans

1415087 lo que se pone de manifiesto en relaci n con los modelos ling sticos es que hay un tripartido enfrentado y dividido
1415088 mecanismos para que todo lo que hace referencia a cuestiones tan importantes como la educaci n se haga desde el m ximo consenso y acuerdo no s lo en el seno del tripartito sino como ven amos reclamando los socialistas con un consenso m s amplio y transversal con los principales grupos de la oposici n

1415091 las reclamaciones que estamos haciendo los socialistas desde hace tiempo en relaci n con lo que hay que hacer en nuestro modelo educativo tambi n ahora el propio pnv entiende que hay que buscar no s lo la flexibilidad como dice sino tambi n acuerdos amplios
1415092 cada vez que se ha abordado una reforma sobre nuestro modelo educativo gobernara quien gobernara siempre se ha intentado hacer desde el m ximo consenso y acuerdo
1415093 esta vez nosotros vamos a seguir reclamando que no se instrumentalice la educaci n y que todas las mejoras o cambios que se tengan que hacer en nuestro modelo educativo se hagan desde el m ximo acuerdo y consenso
1415094 llevan desde hace tiempo planificando toda su actividad en el horizonte de las pr ximas elecciones auton micas
1415095 lo que tendr a que hacer el gobierno es ocuparse de los principales problemas del pa s y de buscar los consensos en aquellas cuestiones b sicas para construir pa s desde el entendimiento y el acuerdo

1415097 w hen seeking to explain how people decide on an option with such conviction that they stick to their decision over time and with such confidence that they act on that decision a dominance structure has been put forth

1415111 then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord

1415114 our existing router which is the lynchpin for our connection to the internet is no longer supported by the manufacturer if it fails there is the potential for an extended outage which would cost the organization xxx per hour until the unit is repaired from a risk perspective a new router would pay for itself after only xxx hours of downtime

1415132 teaching doctoral students to become scholarly writers the importance of giving and receiving critiques
1415133 found that preparing and receiving critiques from professors and peers was perceived to be the most influential element in helping them to understand the process of scholarly writing and in producing a better written product
1415134 in considering your experiences to date what are your perceptions on your ability to give and receive constructive feedback in school work and every day life do you feel adequately prepared
1415135 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
1415136 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
1415137 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
1415138 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
1415139 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
1415140 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
1415141 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
1415142 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
1415143 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
1415144 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
1415145 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
1415146 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
1415147 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
1415148 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
1415149 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
1415150 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
1415151 i think by the fact that we got more than 8 000 petition signatures as opposed to the 5 600 that we were required theres sic a lot of people who think somethings wrong with it
1415152 weve tried to strategically place it so that this election will be held in the spring where the only thing on the ballot will be this issue and the election of some of those city commissioners who voted for this

1415158 i had rib surgery two months ago i just had a cyst in my right hand and they finally got that out now ive got tendinitis in my left elbow
1415159 i think it is a reflection of what is going on in the workplace overall
1415160 job candidates dont trust employers and some job candidates have a real sense of entitlement
1415161 one is that trust is down because of the scandals in corporate america with exorbitant senior executive salaries two hiring managers are overselling jobs and sounding like used car salesman because they under pressure to get the great job candidates and three the pressure is on business to try and fill positions quickly and so theyre doing whatever they can to get the candidate to say yes
1415162 also there are some generational issues because weve got some coddled kids just coming out of school and they just expect to get a job and take over

1415400 i know whats going on so you sit over there and write and ill play some music
1415401 if you brought me a song and you were like this song is going to be about frogs
1415402 cool what lily pad are they going to hop to
1415403 razak did not pay azilah or sirul anything so it is illogical for any professional killer to do the job without any prior payment
1415404 would he have been so stupid to direct azilah to abduct her in front of his house altantuya was in front of razaks house causing a commotion at the time
1415405 would he have wasted money to employ private investigator p balasubramaniam to protect his family from altantuyas harassment
1415406 would he have been so naive as to openly use his personal mobile phone
1415407 this shows he had intended for her to return to mongolia safely besides if he abetted in the murder who was he to direct azilah and sirul to murder her a civilian has no authority to do so
1415408 the medical report did not mention that the victim was sodomised
1415409 if a person is sexually active it does not mean that they were not raped
1415410 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1415411 i have no doubts that when i line up next week on the start line i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean
1415412 that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1415413 that is not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1415414 i was slammed from pillar to the post by the media for not making it past the first round and then i get this news that the girl just in front of me goes positive
1415415 it is a joke and again ive lost count of what ive missed out on because of drug cheats
1415416 the same thing happened in sydney in 2000 and i miss the olympic final by three hundredths of a second despite one of the girls since returning a positive sample
1415417 i want to run a pb and im not making excuses but the facts are there will be those who simply dont want to compete on a level playing field
1415418 i am no moral crusader but when i was competing recently in europe the english girls came up and congratulated me on my world indoor title and said the best thing about it was the fact i did it on my own merit and it was one for the good guys
1415419 i guess a lot of the focus as usual is on the 1500m freestyle for me
1415420 another good event for me is the 400m i feel like things have been going pretty well ive prepared well in that event also
1415421 at the same time i guess i have made it clear that my focus in this preparation has been on that 1500m
1415422 i guess in some respects it feels like a bonus event for me and i would love to be able to better my personal best time in that
1415423 park has said that hell break it well just wait and see how well he swims and what he can do
1415424 i am just looking forward to racing him and giving him a good race
1415425 as far as the melbourne cup we have the horses yeats septimus and efficient with the three best staying performances in the world last year
1415426 add to that the irish derby winner frozen fire and patkai and you can see that aidans experiment in bringing a three year old mahler last year has caught on
1415427 there is no doubt we would be keen to discuss him
1415428 we would certainly discuss anyone who became available like that
1415429 weve always tried to keep an eye on the ex south australians especially ones that have talent like he has
1415430 obviously wed want to talk to him and get a view on his off field issues
1415431 were sold on his ability to play the game but wed obviously want to get a decent view of the off field issues going on
1415432 probably every year weve tried to go down that path to some degree
1415433 like everyone else were very keen to get involved in this draft so wed be reluctant to give up early draft picks

1415458 i was looking at the table before and we can fall to fifth with successive losses
1415459 over the next fortnight we could easily fall away we realise how big it is
1415460 for us to go there is like what it is for other teams to come down here its a tough place to go
1415461 the team found a plastic pack containing 44g of syabu and 1 750 eramin 5 pills
1415462 they also seized eight plastic packets containing 400 ecstasy pills from the house
1415463 about 20 minutes later we arrested three other suspects when they arrived at the house
1415464 police seized a bag containing rm180 000 from the two men and another bag with rm20 524 from the woman
1415465 this case illustrates the needs for the afl in the end of season review to introduce a specific offence for conduct of this nature this has been done with front on contact and head high bumps with success
1415466 whether its a dangerous tackle or a throw tackle or whats referred to in rugby league as a spear tackle but thats a matter for the afl
1415467 i told them it was a matter for them to classify
1415468 neither the tribunal guidelines or the player rules explicitly identify whats meant by contact
1415469 attention hasnt been given by the afl to the type of occurrence that happened here
1415470 wiki a gentleman by the name louis thomas mcfadden then come back to me you pompous jerk
1415471 if necessary we will not hesitate to call executive councillors to give their statements we hope to complete our investigations into the case as soon as possible
1415472 i do not want to reveal more let the aca do the investigation i have spoken to them and they asked us to surrender the files to them
1415473 the sender requested i ensure these documents reach all these individuals
1415474 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former
1415475 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
1415476 what am i doing here really what is the point
1415477 to dress like a tart wiggle your arse in my direction and fill my days with glimpses of the depths of your depraved mind
1415478 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the former
1415479 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
1415480 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1415481 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1415482 why do guys wear pants so large they have to use one hand to hold up their britches
1415483 why do some people feel the need to leave the price tag on their baseball caps
1415484 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1415485 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1415486 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1415487 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that
1415488 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1415489 your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour
1415490 up was not and cannot be the person in charge of the trains when they were bound to the united states as required by the statute
1415491 no time to discuss the finer points with the students jackson i have to get home early and plan my new strategy
1415492 a fine lecture sir herald i would like to go over some of the issues you raised when you have a moment
1415493 i cant stop now im having friends around it needs to be planned you know
1415494 i am afraid i have to say that your lack of understanding is not my problem
1415495 but you dont make sense and whenever i ask you to do something you make an excuse and dont do it not only that but jacksons behaviour in public is embarrassing why do you take him everywhere with you
1415496 and more importantly what is wrong with the bloody garage mechanics
1415497 so you were just playing hard to get lets go to the grocers
1415498 ah yes the order an attempt at a joke sir although i must say that our staff failed to find the funny side of it oh and another thing sir would you mind leaving your dog outside animals are not allowed into the shop
1415499 i gave clear written instructions on the way i wanted my order handled is there a problem there shouldnt be should there harold
1415500 i am sorry sir but we cannot handle your order you will have to try elsewhere
1415501 i must have a word with you about professor sir herald kelso
1415502 not again edgar you will just have to accept that the appointment board were slightly more impressed with heralds cv and interview than they were with yours it was his grasp on the theory that did it
1415503 that is not what i am here for i am here to report his strange behaviour his lectures are of course brilliant but apart from that he has problems
1415504 since he was appointed head of department he has been issuing instructions to everyone from the cleaner to the professional staff and quite frankly they are obtuse in the extreme
1415505 i am sorry to say that not only is it an inappropriate way to behave but no one can understand what he has written that is partly his hand writing but also they dont make sense
1415506 well edgar i am sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for it all
1415507 oh yes jackson a lovely animal i dont see any problem there by the way have you been invited to his dinner party tonight it should be quite a grand occasion
1415508 as it happens i have and i am considering whether i should go will you be there
1415509 indeed i will and would advise you to go too there will be a lot of very important people attending
1415510 you should have let me type them out and send them by email rather than doing everything by hand you must be worn out
1415511 im not talking about the university staff im talking about the bloody supermarket and the garage
1415512 well professor im supposed to be here to help with your university work but tell me what the problem is and we will see if we can get it fixed
1415513 i would by pass the whole bloody lot of them and do it all myself but you know how things have a tendency to go wrong its all to do with the theory if i got that right then everything would be hunky dory
1415514 sir herald your strong point is the theory its when you try to do the practical things that it goes wrong thats why im here to smooth the way forward for you
1415515 i know and youre an angel i dont know what i would do without you
1415516 he said he would be pleased to attend your dinner party tonight
1415517 cheeky blighter i didnt invite him my god i must get away and plan for the grand occasion is there anything i have to do before i go
1415518 oh yes the party invitation could you send a note saying that i fancy the launer turner outfit for the next hmm meeting
1415519 good luck show them what you can do and err good luck with the ladies

1415544 i need to leave tonight is there one going through tonight
1415545 maybe if you try one of the lower level pilots they always come too and fro different jobs to do you see
1415546 oswald you old dog why am i not surprised to see you here
1415547 well john tis because ive not left yet seems to me a winging woman and home chores are not so appealing as a warm grog and slumping in front of the furnace besides theres dust to haul in soon
1415548 ha ha i can understand that pal hang about a second whats that listen to that bloody squelching will you you try your best to make somewhere home regardless of how shabby it appears but you cant get rid of the squelchers
1415549 theres your culprit john look what the catfish caughted up
1415550 christ ossie would you look at the state of him times are harder than they appear it seems
1415551 good evening gentlemen im just passing through this area wonder if i may bargain for some transportation
1415552 to be honest with you mate oswald here and me both cirinium netters we are on different boats at that our areas of mobility are restricted somewhat theres schedules to think about congestion our shipping times are likely to change at any moment and might i add you sound better than you look im very surprised you dont smell like an athletes foot
1415553 ill second what john said a bit further down are the pilots you want id say it was a smuggler you needed really maybe they could provide a service better suited to your needs like to help you really but tied to the cirinium cloud we are
1415554 to be perfectly honest with you gentlemen i actually intend to go the one way through the gate im an explorer you see ill find the next stage of my path when i get through
1415555 well if we could offer some service it would cost a pretty penny im not precisely sure what you expect to be finding over there mind i heard its just like here
1415556 my good man thats just it im here right now ive done here the value for me is there it may be just like here but there is where the unknown lies
1415557 perhaps youd like to stop for a drink with me and john anyway wont do any harm you look as though you need it even if john and i are too busy to accept your job have a bit of hospitality free of charge james flagon of froth there son
1415558 well john and i have introduced ourselves you are sir
1415559 quite how very rude of me percival stockley is my name delighted please excuse my dirty hands too
1415560 not atall percival oswald and i are workingmen but i must say your quite the oddest combination of sight and sound ive seen and heard this side of mars mr stockley did you manage to strand yourself
1415561 oh no my vessel is quite the old girl now of my design too time has afflicted her terribly so i now need transport i sold her for scrap at the entrance to the station but enough of me how did you fine gentlemen come to find yourselves way out here as close as one might get to hell
1415562 well i arrived here twenty year ago when the colonisation first started this base was taken from the reds just before i forget when did you first move here ossie
1415563 oh it were about 14 year ago now me and the missus had only earnt enough air for three lives for our family in gloucester well you can imagine the fuss when she found out about t twins i personally wouldnt have minded them taking one of them yknow for the labs and all we had a ruddy nice view from our living block i were right for staying the missus said wed come here the air mortgages are cheaper 2 3rds the price for 14 times filtered i said theyre making the saving not us but the wife said it werent about the money this were only place we could afford 4 lives worth the only place we could afford to raise both of em so here i am
1415564 im a traveller the ship i spoke of is constructed of a lesser ore than todays modern craft i built it to search the earth but i searched the earth for something i could not find and ended up here
1415565 searched the earth you say must have taken a while what was it in aid of
1415566 i dont really follow what you mean just how long might we be talking youve slightly greying hair surely but not enough to make you old
1415567 to tell the truth i cant be sure to say ive been travelling a long while now and excuse my language its one of the things that make me old another drink perhaps before i continue
1415568 just thinking the same myself james lets have another mate for the storyteller too
1415569 ah thank you now where was i ah yes looking for hell it came to me i should think in the way expected of the damned i would implement my mind to recall my most carnal thoughts i remember once watching a film show of women squirting as they came during sex oh how i enjoyed it as i choked the ticket maid with one hand masturbating with the other but it seemed as much evil as i could create society would just come to accept it keeping sin from my fingertips well enough to damn me anyway but that was later to come i think of this time as my socially unacceptable time i had few friends as a consequence in my previous life i had no chance of reaching hell using such bourgeois such obscene methods just muddled it came to me then maybe i should invite hell to me i started to curse at friends i stole from my neighbours once i remember running over a childs dog that had scampered in front of me three times i sent it under my cart i heard its bones crack and the yelps of pain i was sure that would cast me to hell alas i remained undammed and unfulfilled in my quest it came to me that the sacrifices should have a connection with hell as i did they should be christians too i started with my young son he was my first a good throttling ensured an easy first experience that night i did my wife and daughter too my wifes screams still haunt my dreams when she found me choking the life out of our daughter the following day i smoked iroquois herbs and reflecting upon my previous evening i replayed my experience in my mind tainting my soul with my evil acts in an attempt to secure my journey to hell i stayed there in my macabre residence alive bored and unfulfilled surrounded by the meat of my family so i left making my way to different lands with a new entry plan i arrived on the beach of a faraway land a land under colonisation and just learning of the scriptures i taught the people there they learned from me and looked to me for direction in the forming colony i led them to war with the praise of god in their ears for the next 13 years we toured the world building our empire and slaughtering the many peoples of the world we killed until our legs waded in blood and sinew in those days finding new and inventive ways of sending souls from the real world proved ever challenging in my mind all id ever done is send lives to hell but i couldnt get there coast to coast i had eradicated maybe a million or 2 maybe 3 million souls with my army
1415570 well id have to say john im not sure if we can offer passage through maybe id even have to get off
1415571 okay oswald ill see you later pal mind how you go i wouldnt mind hearing where this confession goes mr stockley another
1415572 taking over a continent on the old world if im not mistaken
1415573 indeed well at that point i must admit to running into something of a pickle the unsociable behaviours i had previously tried to guide me to hell were no longer sins since i was currently leading an entire people toward conquest and society which it can be argued is mans most natural pursuit the murders i had committed could now be justified i found out i wasnt the only mass murderer on the planet it seemed sins no matter how severe could be justified new routes to hell were needed i and my countrymen built the ship i currently travel in it is very much a prototype for the first orbit leaving ships when i left i eradicated the last remnants of the planet for good measure i burnt the society i created including my army of course they became the ash that suffocates that world now the world i left behind that had no hell within it
1415574 its getting near the opening time to go through the blue ships blocking the station will change shift 30 minute window to dash through you still after that transport
1415575 would you be offering transport or do you know someone oswald
1415576 i might be able to help out percival we can leave in 45 minutes as long as you can afford the fee its a big risk for me so it isnt cheap and if i get caught you stowed away your risk is your own
1415577 so what do you expect to find on the other side of the gate
1415578 when the earth was no more i assumed the void would supply my destination so ill find out when i get there
1415579 well percy i dont mind saying youve no friends here if you are who you claim to be your story though is just what i need dont get many stories these days carry on pal ill listen
1415580 im aware ive no friends that should be obvious by my appearance and mannerisms ive known no real human connectivity since my teens even my family seemed so distant its why it was so easy to dispatch them my search for hell has eluded me im surrounded by the crumbling ruins of mankind as it passes into the abyss i live with the knowledge that i am the cancer that has crumbled the foundations of man when i pass through i will leave a species that will surely disappear to time and at my hand no less but always i tell myself this is what i am and this is the life i was offered should i feel sorry that my life continuing has ended so many others or should i conclude that our species cumulative knowledge and teachings have led me on this course am i not natural and always i remember my search for hell has been in vain but every person i have ever encountered have sure enough found it just fine
1415581 well ill attest to that we wont last much longer out here and this is hell oxygen doesnt grow on trees as the station master always says not much left now the synthetic stuff halves your life too
1415582 quite shall we leave then ill leave you a worthy sum of course and what i have left of my old ship which certainly has antique value ive searched this whole galaxy there is no hell for me the only answer to that is to go through there
1415583 ok then lets sink these and go you leave me your antique vessel parts and your oxygen ticket ill send you to hell mr stockley
1415584 well it would seem an accord has been reached thank you sir such gracious behaviour

1415614 and a then we kill a the shit of a the animal police and a without a them to stand in a my way the multi a million pound takeaway industry of a norwich will a be mine all mine
1415615 its longo all of this the dogshit the paw the car the handkerchief for christs sake the fat fuckers up to something she followed us here from london got in as our keyworker found out our fuckin address burnt out our car and planted that dog dick in the factory
1415616 and the body parts and that fuckin stench i recognise grilled dog meat anywhere and that shit last night that was dog meat even the paw
1415617 well thats the difficult bit aside from the fact that the big bastards probably got a thing for kebabs i dont really know and she doesnt have the brains to be organising a racket like this so she must be working for someone but shes in on it this kebab jobs got longo and the italians written all over it
1415618 its the only explanation why do you think were getting such a hard fuckin time last thing you want sniffing around a racket like this is animal police were enemy number fuckin one longos just a stooge but i dont doubt that those filthy italians are supplying half the county with cheap animal meat i mean how many peopled really know the difference
1415619 why the wops isnt it the arabs that make kebabs
1415620 although it is odd i grant you must be money in it and power its the way of the world everybody respects the man who gets the meat maybe its a respect thing i dont fuckin know all i know is that its happening and longos in on it and if that bitch will burn up our fuckin car whats her boss gonna be prepared to do to us
1415621 kebabs i had a bad experience once a bad experience

1415625 we got our kebabs lamb doner for the gent chicken shish for the lady and thought wed walk them home only lived a few minutes away thats when it happened
1415626 these fuckin two bit muggers followed us a way and then jumped us they knocked us both over but pulled me up to my feet asking for my wallet i was a bit drunk and i didnt want any trouble jesus i just tried to give them the fuckin thing but they werent having it start laying their hands on my wife whose still on the floor theyre holding her down
1415627 fuckin touchin her the dirty little bastards and they start unwrapping her kebab fuckin laughing while theyre doing it and all i can hear is her crying and crying but i cant do nothing because theyre holding me i cant do nothing
1415628 fuckers force the kebab into her mouth shes gasping for breath and they force the kebab in her mouth dripping garlic sauce and grease and limp fuckin salad and they laugh while they rape her she isnt gasping by then she isnt nothing just lying there
1415629 by the time theyre through i kneel next to her but i know shes dead choked on a kebab a fuckin kebab they murder my wife and they take my wallet and what am i left with a tepid doner what could i do
1415630 what the fuck could i do i lost everything and for what kebabs it was no fuckin good i threw myself into the heroin and never once came up for air i wanted to obliterate every shred of myself that was leftover from that mess i didnt want to see it again
1415631 im bullshitting no one man i fuckin hate kebabs and thats why kebabs killed my wife they took everything i had and it was all because of kebabs that i can almost live with but using dogs fuckin cats and italians fuckin doing it its not right boys ill tell you that much

1415688 we finally figured out we cant be individuals out on the field weve got to play as a team to win
1415689 he told me i was sure i was going to pick the ball off

1415691 he has some great legs he can move around and has a great arm
1415692 weve just having a problem getting in the end zone
1415693 wide receiver andre jackson has been catching balls left and right going up and down the field we just cant punch it in they just pulled it together today
1415694 if we had gone for those i think i was almost guaranteed a six there between the two of them
1415695 i didnt call them because the last two weeks weve been going on fourth and three and making it i called my kicker off the field twice that just wasnt good percentage football i really feel it was my fault
1415696 weve talked with most of the guys and most of the guys are going to be back with us next season
1415697 i think well just be able to build on what weve done so far
1415698 we figured out its easier to play with guys who want to play with us
1415699 you dont have to have 80 guys on your sidelines to win football games you need 11 guys on both sides that want to play football were looking for a cast of guys to stick around thatll come back next season already know the program and help the younger guys catch on
1415700 we do have the personnel to be able to throw now
1415701 hal is really starting to feel comfortable as a quarterback and hes stepping up
1415702 i do know that theyve got an awful lot of talent on that ball club
1415703 i think were going to have to stick to our run game and keep their offense off the field

1416002 social policy should probably be more orientated towards the problems associated with the fertility levels for specific groups rather than towards aggregate fertility levels
1416003 one for mum one for dad and one for the country

1416032 we are preparing the flights of our strategic aircraft to the indian ocean to practice interoperability with the russian navy task force in the region
1416033 since august 2007 russian strategic bombers have carried out about 150 patrol flights with tactical interference of foreign aircraft which accompanied our planes on their missions and in some instances jeopardized the success of these missions

1416037 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1416038 but that may not be the end of our approach to competition policy in the sector if we think that its not competitive enough
1416039 economic growth is slowing but on the other hand we still have in parts of the country labour shortages and skills shortages as well
1416040 wayne swan and kevin rudd have spent every day since the election talking up inflation and talking down the economy this is the slowdown kevin rudd and wayne swan wanted us to have
1416041 we wont get a one off retracing of what the banks have done
1416042 if growth is going to be as weak as the reserve bank is hinting at we could have a succession of rate cuts
1416043 we will do everything possible to ensure the market is as vigorous as possible to ensure prices do go down
1416044 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1416045 choice has campaigned for unit pricing for many years because it will help drive competition
1416046 overall it is expected to return millions of dollars to consumers
1416047 its disappointing that the focus has predominantly been on the retail side and not allowing for further analysis through the chain
1416048 the australian government today released a thorough analysis of the grocery market which dispels the myths and lays the facts on the table
1416049 our main concern is that unit pricing does not become complex costly regulation with shoppers picking up the tab

1416057 history has shown it is liberal governments that govern the state well and prepare for future generations
1416058 what you do is to have the preparations in place so at some time in the future you can press the button
1416059 i hope i wont need to press the button but if i have to in the interest of the state i will do so
1416060 ive got a job to do and i intend to keep doing it

1416066 they have said that they are working on it but i have no idea on timing or anything like that
1416067 we would not want to do anything including authorising the publication of any documents which could potentially compromise the integrity of those proceedings
1416068 it is also likely that some of the information that is currently protected will be disclosed during the course of the british prosecutions
1416069 you cant hide behind this smokescreen of the secret british information imagine if the boot was on the other foot
1416070 john called me on saturday to say hello and to tell me about his court case in which he is going to challenge the will
1416071 the last time i spoke with him was when i was five years old and he was pushing me on a swing that was 50 years ago so we had lots to talk about we discussed our father our families our lives and of course the will
1416072 i remember when bob came on the tv to promote budget dad would change the station and mum would walk into the kitchen
1416073 he used to say when i die it is all going with me
1416074 he did say to me at one stage you will never be classified as a wealthy woman
1416075 i think when dad wrote his will he was a very depressed person who felt very let down almost anti money
1416076 my mother had a very strong and dominating personality and any questions relating to the provisions of my fathers will were forcefully put to one side by her
1416077 any attempt to force such an issue would have been destructive and divisive of the family
1416078 i did it because i have a wife and five children
1416079 i have always thought the will was unfair and i did not expect any less from my father
1416080 i am thrilled that john has won the right to challenge the will
1416081 we wish all the family good luck but how would janet feel if the others got a million or two each and we were slaughtered when her case for a fair share was the strongest
1416082 i dont believe dad would have wanted all of this
1416083 its obligation to uphold the will and the terms of the will

1416086 dagli atleti azzurri serve un gesto forte e in questo senso anche disertare linaugurazione sarebbe un segnale importante da dare
1416087 certamente appoggio al pari di tutto il mondo civile la richiesta alla cina di una politica che sia garante dei diritti umani in modo molto molto maggiore rispetto a quello che accaduto fino ad oggi considero le olimpiadi comunque una festa di fratellanza tra i popoli e lesperienza dimostra che ogni qualvolta si dato corso al boicottaggio dei giochi olimpici non si raggiunto lobiettivo che ci si prefiggeva
1416088 non credo che i nostri atleti abbiano necessit di inviti particolari perch sanno perfettamente qual il dovere morale cui adempiono nel momento in cui gareggiano e credo che non mancher loro la possibilit nelle modalit che riterranno pi opportune per esprimere piena adesione alla necessit di un rispetto autentico dei diritti delle persone
1416089 sono andati fin l evidentemente vogliono sfilare mi sembra un po ipocrita che uno vada l per poi manifestare dissenso io non sono per le mezze misure ma per le misure dirette
1416090 gli atleti italiani sfileranno regolarmente alla cerimonia di apertura dei giochi rispetto le opinioni di tutti non c niente di pi autonomo e libero dello sport quindi non mi stupisco che ci siano posizioni diverse anche allinterno dellesecutivo e chiaro che le olimpiadi sono una grande festa dello sport che nessuno pu vuole e deve politicizzare non vuole farlo il governo che rispetta le regole del cio che stabilisce che cosa debbono o non debbono fare gli atleti
1416091 il tema dei diritti umani si affronta ogni giorno e non nelle tre settimane dellolimpiadi
1416092 deploriamo ogni invito rivolto agli atleti affinch non prendano parte allinaugurazione dei giochi olimpici
1416093 non far parte di questa parata se avessi voluto andare al circo sarei andata a quello di roncalli
1416094 il gesto di imke duplitzer sia da stimolo per tutti gli atleti compresi quelli italiani si tratta di un gesto simbolico che dovrebbe invitare tutti a riflettere su quei principi fondamentali pace libert e democrazia che non possono essere messi in secondo piano
1416095 certi politici anche se sono vicini alle mie idee sono incompetenti non capiscono certe cose al di fuori del loro mondo non vedo perch disertare la cerimonia di apertura allora tanto valeva boicottare i giochi e poi al ministro meloni chiedo ma lei diserterebbe loccasione della vita
1416096 per un atleta vivere lapertura dei giochi la cosa pi bella della vita esserci tutto non esserci sarebbe come per un credente rinnegare la propria fede o per un marito fedele arrivare a tradire la moglie
1416097 i have a friend i like like that and i don

1416099 there is but one law eat or be eaten stopmouth and his family know of no other life than the daily battle to survive to live they must hunt rival species or negotiate flesh trade with those who crave meat of the freshest human kind it is a savage desperate existence and for stopmouth considered slow witted hunt fodder by his tribe the future looks especially bleak but then on the day he is callously betrayed by his brother a strange and beautiful woman falls from the sky it is a moment that will change his destiny and that of all humanity forever

1416121 cairo iraqi and us teams negotiating a controversial security pact have reached an initial agreement that states that us troops will withdraw from iraq between 2010 and 2011 the pro government iraqi al sabah newspaper reported monday the newspaper reported that the iraqi and american technical teams have already reported the outcome of their negotiations to their political leaders during the past days the paper also reported that ongoing negotiations between both parties is nearing an end allowing the signing of a memorandum of understanding very soon the paper quoted anonymous iraqi sources as saying that there is a great development in the talks and we reached an initial bilateral agreement for the pullout of us troops by 2010 and 2011 the us and iraq have been negotiating the security pact also called the status of forces agreement sofa since march the long term agreement would lay down the legal basis for a continued us military presence in iraq after a un mandate expires in december however after months of disputes and criticism the united states and iraq are working on a short term memorandum of understanding instead several iraqi politicians and lawmakers are against the mandate saying it will violate the countrys sovereignty the most vocal of critics is radical shiite cleric moqtada al sadr who strongly opposes the us presence in iraq he called on iraqis to unite and stand up against the accord by all means possible iran also opposes any deal between baghdad and washington which extends the presence of us troops in the neighbouring country

1416123 on april 28 2006 plaintiff suffered a sudden hearing loss in his right ear vertigo loss of equilibrium and other personal injuries related thereto and has continued to suffer the same injuries from said date through and including the present date
1416124 upon plaintiffs information and belief plaintiffs injuries were caused by electromagnetic radiation emanating from the motorola and by said defendants respective failure to adequately warn of such dangers
1416125 motorola takes the safety of its products and its customers very seriously
1416126 more generally we can say that expert scientific panels and health agencies around the world have consistently confirmed the safety of the rf technology used in mobile phones
1416127 the trait people remember best about obama in addition to his intellect is his ambition
1416128 has run on the vague promise of change but on issue after issue immigration the economy global warming he has offered boilerplate policies that evade the underlying causes of the stalemates he seems to have hypnotized much of the media and the public with his eloquence and the symbolism of his life story the result is a mass delusion that obama is forthrightly engaging the nations major problems when so far he isnt
1416129 i know that even a successful war against iraq will require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
1416130 you dread those types of calls because you never know how theyll turn out but fortunately everybody was ok
1416131 we responded with more than enough people to help out

1416133 the visit of patrushev who is also head of the federal security service and sechin came after media reports said russia could place an orbital ballistic missile system in cuba in response to u s missile defense plans for central europe in october 1962 the cuban missile crisis brought the u s and the u s s r to the brink of war when soviet missiles were stationed in cuba the crisis was resolved after 12 days when the soviet leader nikita khrushchev backed down and ordered the missiles removed
1416134 how can affiliates be encouraged to send more incremental sales or new customers
1416135 were offering merchants the ability to maintain on sale and deal of the day rss campaigns for affiliates to publish on their sites
1416136 and to take it one step further the affiliates can promote subscriptions to the same rss feeds the key in generating feed subscribers from their site in addition to of course sales is affiliate ids being embedded in links from the deal feeds for as long as they are in use
1416137 in my opinion no tools have emerged as promising for affiliates and publishers to use in this space
1416138 theres a real lack of innovation and this needs to change
1416139 affiliate networks are finding new ways to meet our growing needs
1416140 but others are finding ways to help drive sales and scale as well
1416141 for once there seems to be no clear cut favourite in the sack race this season but media stories suggesting unrest between a boss and his squad with the season less than a fortnight away are highly unlikely to reassure blackburn fans that their team is in good shape with the first game imminent

1416194 as more investment portfolios contain interest rate swaps weve expanded the capabilities of our valuation service to respond to client demand for a broad range of independent valuations
1416195 our new 3 p m interest rate swap valuations are synchronized with the corporate bond evaluations we currently produce and they complement our end of day valuations for this asset class accounting firms and hedge fund processors have also identified historical valuations for interest rate and credit default swaps as critical for monitoring client positions as they need to retrieve valuation levels reflecting the previous end of month we also added compounding swaps to enable clients to obtain valuations on interest rate swaps with nontraditional structures

1416444 my position regarding the relay was always clear i always said i didnt want to take a girls place
1416445 i did not participate in the relay sessions so i excluded myself the relay is just not in my mind afterwards and if im asked well see
1416446 its not because i am not doing the 200 metres that i am looking at the relay
1416447 ive been there in the relay so its no longer an objective and i think that what ive said about the other girls relay performances that you cant hope to have ambitions when youre running 11 50s went down badly
1416448 since then they hardly give me the time of day i dont have contact with the girls its difficult to do the relay under those conditions

1416475 the junior players mindset is never consistent and they can be easily rattled the moment they win they put pressure on themselves but i dont think this will be the case with hee chun and kok siang
1416476 i still regard them as underdogs in the world juniors as they will facing the same opponents their best match in the whole tournament was against chai biao zhang nan but their overall performance was just average
1416477 so they still have a lot to catch up on with emphasis on their strength they must also keep improving their attack and defence
1416478 the pairs from china and south korea are still better combinations and hee chun kok siang know that they are not the favourites at the world juniors they must start from square one again

1416483 he is always on time for training and willingly goes through any tough drills without complaining
1416484 even the media may have sensed how approachable he is these days and all this has actually helped him grow into a greater player the change has also reduced the pressure on him
1416485 as a coach i dont need anymore commitment and i sincerely want him to be rewarded with a medal in beijing as he really deserves it
1416486 i realise that everything is about my own approach and if i tune my mind to go through the tough routines i will enjoy it as in the long term it produces consistent results
1416487 there were times i suffered headaches from continuous tough sessions but i didnt give in to the pressure

1416495 i do not want to comment on anything right now it is best that the afc president explains
1416496 yes we discussed moving the afc house out from malaysia it was the presidents idea but the committee felt that the congress should decide on the matter
1416497 tengku abddullah was very upset but we have to discuss this further
1416498 we dont know what the reason is but we gather it is because of the lack of malaysian government support i cant say anything more
1416499 t h at is the presidents proposal but i think its best that the media talk to him i cant comment
1416500 i dont think it is something to be worried about we will see how it goes
1416501 i think the president wants commitment from the government on issues such as tax exemption and other related matters
1416502 for me afc house should remain in malaysia as the facilities and infrastructure are excellent also we have spent a lot of money here
1416503 iamnot aware of the issue relating to government support but my office is always open to the afc or any other association to discuss problems or if help is needed

1416543 last year we challenged malaysians to excel under stressful situations by doing so we managed to command an audience reach of up to 950 000 nationwide
1416544 this year were setting out to demand their best performance under the tutelage of these successful mentors with a new set of tasks
1416545 i took all views into account with the hope of structuring a compromise that would be acceptable and fair to all
1416546 in a systematic and credible manner for the prime minister based on clearly defined criteria
1416547 the system must have built in safeguards to prevent potential abuse and convincingly identify the best legal minds in the country to join the judiciary
1416548 over the last 20 years there has been enough said on the state of our judiciary which gives rise to concerns including quality of judgments allegations of corruption and that the judiciary is partial
1416549 boldly stated he was at liberty to put up candidates on his own without any prior input from the chief justice
1416550 no new provisions or institution would prevent further abuse although it could help to minimise it
1416551 anywhere in the world the power to appoint lies with the executive
1416552 the one thing that protects the judiciary is that an independent procedure is put in place and there is no way to dismiss them arbitrarily
1416553 in the us for example the american bar association is consulted informally then candidates have to attend a congressional hearing where not only their competency but also their views are scrutinised its very open
1416554 for the commission to be seen to be truly independent the malaysian bar should not be on it but their views should be gathered informally transmitted to the commission heard and considered
1416555 the judiciary will not be at the mercy of the bar council as the commission members consist of representatives from the judiciary executive and the attorney general whereas the bar council only forms the minority
1416556 ultimately ensure that the candidates shortlisted would fulfil all the criteria set out by the commission and agreed upon by its members
1416557 if we want an independent judicial appointments commission for the appointment of judges then we must be prepared for a change in mindset

1416563 many digital content goods and services are becoming basic must haves particularly in the sub 35 age group devices like the iphone even in its 3g incarnation are undoubtedly contributing to consumer awareness and usage of mobile music services people who are 15 to 20 today will expect to buy directly with their phones and will drive this market over the next few years
1416564 even though typical transaction sizes will remain in the 3 5 bracket a sufficient number of users will be using their mobiles to buy music games tickets infotainment and the other digital goods sufficiently often to see gross transaction value grow nearly seven fold by 2013

1416604 acabo de leer a un airado periodista de origen ingl s llamado christopher hitchens quien public en slate una arenga que por momentos me hizo recordar a ese profesional de lo incendiario que fue el monje savonarola
1416605 el enemigo m s grande de la libertad de prensa no es un estado que censura un propietario monop lico el anunciante que quiere una cobertura favorable o al menos la ausencia de una cobertura desfavorable sino un periodista o editor cobarde que no necesita que le digan lo que debe hacer pues ha internalizado sic la necesidad de agradar o al menos de no ofender a la pero tiran a de todas la de cierta opini n p blica que considera que su logro m s alto es saberse cubrir las espaldas
1416606 por su complejo de inferioridad y su complejo de superioridad
1416607 los intelectuales de izquierda admiran a bin laden que este se ha convertido en el nuevo che guevara
1416608 el desastre de irak es un trago amargo pero yo sigo defendiendo la invasi n porque solo as ganaremos esta guerra
1416609 christopher hitchens es un provocador nos lo anunciaba honestamente otero en la entrevista ya citada siempre le ha gustado ir en contra de la corriente mayoritaria y quiz s por eso oh qu extraordinaria sorpresa es que ha dejado de ser un intelectual de izquierdas como todo el mundo critica ahora a bush l por llevar la contraria lo defiende
1416610 no cuenta con suficiente apoyo electoral y es un seguro perdedor en las elecciones de noviembre
1416611 hes the best stayer in the world and i think youll find he makes the trip across to melbourne
1416612 if you asked me one horse i would love to own septimus would be that horse
1416613 septimus is a two mile 3200m horse but has mile and a half 2400m speed hes outstanding
1416614 hell return in the makybe diva 1600m september 6 then go to the turnbull stakes 2000m october 4 thats it
1416615 im not a believer in this business of having to give horses seven lead up runs before the melbourne cup thats an out dated australian ism
1416616 aidan obrien is the best trainer in the world hes trained 17 group 1 winners already this year and he doesnt give his horses seven lead up runs
1416617 he spent some time at flemington and now hes back at our macedon property
1416618 hell spend quite a bit of time there now weve got it up and running
1416619 our survey has found out that many people are simply unaware that these old and unused phones lying around in drawers can be recycled others do not know how to go about doing this
1416620 if all three billion people who own phones today brought back just one unused device we could recover 240 000 tonnes of raw material
1416621 life is good our journey in the music business has been a great experience for us and we have met a lot of wonderful people along the way
1416622 we try not to listen to the critics we play our music for our fans because they are the driving force of the band without them we would not be here today
1416623 he is a simple man i thought he would be using his hat and leather pants to the studio to my disappointment he wore a pair of jeans and a baseball cap
1416624 we miss our families badly we really appreciate our families for understanding the nature of our jobs and its demands our wives have been really patient with us
1416625 but on the bright side travelling with the band is like travelling with your own brothers we have a great time on the road and we are never short of jokes and laughs
1416626 we might release our second album sometime next year we do not have any plans of going in the recording studio at the moment
1416627 ego lelaki sesekali kena pukul jugak males ego needs to be bashed once in a while
1416628 good god i have completely submitted myself to this woman
1416629 reggie is our fourth string quarterback who we are developing right now and i dont want him to play other positions this is an emergency for us
1416630 mcneal was drafted as a receiver in the nfl he was a running quarterback in high school and at texas a amp m he ran a run oriented offence
1416631 hes probably the best athlete we have on our football team
1416632 its one of those injuries thats the worst injury you can have in football because you never know when its completely healed
1416633 we just have to execute better down in the red zone
1416634 we put ourselves in good situations against winnipeg we moved the ball but we had chances to execute and just didnt do it it easily could have been 30 3 at the half
1416635 it was a return set up to go left and what i saw was how we executed it in practice i really only had to make one move against bombers kicker alexis serna and i knew if i got tackled by their kicker that i was going to have to buy doughnuts as punishment and i didnt want to do that
1416636 offensively we got away a little bit from what worked for us in the first half we just werent making the plays we should have made we had drives that were going and then we had dropped balls or bobbled snaps what could go wrong went wrong for us in the second half
1416637 they were pretty much waiting on him at the line of scrimmage once he got there they did a good job of getting off our guys and getting back there and making the tackle
1416638 its just an awfully tough kick i probably would have had to hit one of the best balls of my life to get that sucker in
1416639 its coming to a point where we need to do a lot better with our discipline for a couple games now weve hurt ourselves until we correct that its going to be a long season
1416640 its been an emotional week for this team it was extremely inspirational to have him here before the game so soon after the surgery we played really hard tonight it wasnt always easy but we found a way to win it good football teams find a way to win
1416641 this year we are winning some of the close games i think it just shows the leadership we have on the football team and the belief we have in one another we are a better football team bottom line we dont beat ourselves and in years past we probably have a little bit when you have all three phases of the game playing well you are probably going to come out on top
1416642 the hats go off to our defence tonight our defence held us in especially in the second half with some big plays
1416643 my teammates got off the ball real good and i just cleaned up our guys came to play and got pressure we worry about the plays in front of us and not the plays behind us
1416644 we came here knowing it was going to be a tough game and it was our offensive line won the battle and our line pounded them around giving us holes
1416645 against a toronto team that makes you fight for every yard we were looking at a lot of 15 and 20 yard situations you cant afford to do that against that type of defence
1416646 as soon as we got into any rhythm we got into penalties penalties can kill your confidence it was second and long all night
1416647 first third of the season i cant believe wed go 1 5 its frustrating weve got to find a way to fix it go back to the drawing board
1416648 offensively i thought we did some good things richie did what he can do we had too many penalties i dont know what the total was but weve been doing good the last time we lost the penalty ratio was the first game against montreal and the rest of the games weve been plus
1416649 he stubler knows he can say things like that that really piss us off i think tonight we got a bit of our old mojo back
1416650 when you slow down no 1 roberts your chances of winning go way up
1416651 i thought at halftime it shouldve been 30 3 we left a lot of points out there but it wasnt because we didnt control the football yeah im disappointed but were 3 3
1416652 we gave up one big play but holding that offence to 11 points with milt on it i thought was pretty good we knocked the snot out of people and played our old defence
1416653 i told a lot of people during the course of the week that the first time a player plays theyre really pretty good i dont think hes a seasoned cfl quarterback yet i do think he has a lot of potential i think he has a great attitude and great thought process
1416654 its something that im definitely going to reflect on now and then when im done i continue to stay healthy and im surrounded by good talent and good things are going to come from that so as long as i can stay healthy and these guys do their job around me were going to do some special things here in montreal
1416655 it was a huge play obviously to be able to start fast but to my recollection the last three games i think weve started fast in the third quarter
1416656 any game you can come in and go 5 for 5 its definitely a good feeling especially two of them being 50 and 51
1416657 get back on your feet because the show must go on

1416675 as for the lucarno which will be held next month i dont think i can make it because we are rehearsing for my upcoming film talentime we will shoot the film on aug 17 in ipoh

1416681 the schaeffler group thus counters market speculation that its offer to continental shareholders could be prevented by such preparatory measures

1416685 people often say parenting comes naturally and thats true to an extent but any parent will tell you that they could always use some kind of extra support
1416686 they may say things like we didnt have that problem with you or you guys were easy to raise its a different world today and raising children has become a real challenge
1416687 usually we only hear of the really bad cases so parents panic when they are told their child has the condition but when others who have been through it share their experiences parents can understand the situation better and even take the right precautions
1416688 parenting can get a little crazy sometimes and it helps to talk and share with people who truly understand just how complicated things can get
1416689 its good to be able to talk things over with another parent and learn something from their experience if we can gain something beneficial from others and pass it on why shouldnt we do it
1416690 a hair in the head is worth two in the brush

1416693 we went through old classic cocktail recipes we wanted to modernize and created updated versions of these classics by mixing new premium spirits with combinations of ingredients and flavors that complement our food

1416727 the obama campaign has signaled for example through national finance chair penny pritzker that its going to rely more on traditional fund raising techniques from here on out than it did through the primaries
1416728 so their fund raising will be more of a balance between the small donor internet based fund raising and the traditional donor efforts and therefore the new york fund raising community is very important to the obama campaign and that campaign has been playing close attention to that community

1416764 the gao concludes even with the most favorable and unrealistic assumptions that the laws implementation will most probably result in a 50 percent decline in the economic output of the commonwealth by 2021 if not sooner
1416765 if this legislation had been considered on its merits by congress in light of this gao report we cannot believe that the members would have decided to inflict this potentially devastating injury on the commonwealth
1416766 the report is disappointing in some of its limitations disappointing in its timing and i wonder whether given the fact that they dont really have any economic data with which to analyze the economic impact of the minimum wage and federal immigration laws and any other federal intervention here they should have restrained themselves
1416767 it seems to me if i was at one of the agencies writing the regs i would want the data that gao says they dont have

1416804 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1416805 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1416812 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men

1416840 understand the strange marketing infused atmosphere in which we all live one in which consumers are inundated with branding messages one in which executives are obsessed with their brand to the point of distraction and one in which anything and everything is open to manipulation

1416849 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1416850 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1416851 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1416852 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1416853 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1416854 if he is i might go see him when im done here

1416858 we supply the country with cheap food but the benefit does not come back to us

1416860 im afraid im going to have nightmares and im going to get stuck there
1416861 when animals are exposed to a severe threat the basic adaptation is to wake up more frequently
1416862 i gave up my tranquillity as many of the other warriors did so the rest of america can have theirs
1416863 it got to the point where we had to choose between bathing ourselves and sleep between sleeping or eating
1416864 it basically sticks me in an eight hour nightmare fest so thats not a solution for me
1416865 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1416866 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1416867 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1416868 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1416869 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1416870 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1416871 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians
1416872 new book out and making the move to open access
1416873 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media

1416875 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
1416876 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
1416877 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
1416878 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
1416879 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality

1416883 now the real nature of calvinistic soteriology becomes plain it is no artificial oddity nor a product of overbold logic its central confession that god saves sinners that christ redeemed us by his blood is the witness both of the bible and of the believing heart the calvinist is the christian who confesses before men in his theology just what he believes in his heart before god when he prays he thinks and speaks at all times of the sovereign grace of god in the way that every christian does when he pleads for the souls of others or when he obeys the impulse of worship which rises unbidden within him prompting him to deny himself all praise and to give all the glory of his salvation to his savior calvinism is the natural theology written on the heart of the new man in christ whereas arminianism is an intellectual sin of infirmity natural only in the sense in which all such sins are natural even to the regenerate calvinistic thinking is the christian being himself on the intellectual level arminian thinking is the christian failing to be himself through the weakness of the flesh calvinism is what the christian church has always held and taught when its mind has not been distracted by controversy and false traditions from attending to what scripture actually says that is the significance of the patristic testimonies to the teaching of the five points which can be quoted in abundance owen appends a few on redemption a much larger collection may be seen in john gills the cause of god and truth so that really it is most misleading to call this soteriology calvinism at all for it is not a peculiarity of john calvin and the divines of dort but a part of the revealed truth of god and the catholic christian faith calvinism is one of the odious names by which down the centuries prejudice has been raised against it but the thing itself is just the biblical gospel
1416884 since most of the union membership is muslim a majority of 700 out of 1200 and the contract allows for only a fixed number of paid holidays this change makes sense

1416886 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
1416887 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
1416888 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
1416889 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

1416894 the news of that abject surrender provoked an explosion of outrage across jammu
1416895 the governor has violated the sasb act he cannot act unilaterally any decision of the board has to be endorsed by at least five members
1416896 he is also in contempt of the high court which had passed an interim order approving the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the board in baltal
1416897 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1416898 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley anymore jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1416899 vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1416900 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1416901 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
1416902 it was his way of registering his protest against omar abdullahs speech in parliament he was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity

1416906 our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1416907 we believe that these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1416908 the scientific research on the effect of grooves on spin and the ability of highly skilled professional golfers to control shots from the rough was very compelling
1416909 the usga and the r amp a took additional time to consider fully the potential ramifications for all levels of golfers in particular we took care to minimize the impact on amateurs who actively compete in club and local competitions as well as other golfers who do not want to replace recently purchased clubs

1416934 the main theme is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1416935 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1416936 for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life there are people over there dealing with situations like this and were showing the human part of being there
1416937 one thing i havent seen mentioned with regard to the attempt to implicate iraq in the anthrax scare in fall of 2001 is the reason iraq was hard to rule out as a source
1416938 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1416939 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1416940 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1416941 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue

1416950 unfortunately i cant make any comment other than to say that as soon as the band has clear future plans they will issue a statement and we hope to be able to do that in the next week or two
1416951 morgan you just dont even sweat it you get better were thinking of you were waiting for you baby
1416952 im not a doctor which brings me to another point it seems like the media is often giving celebrities and actors more authority on this issue than theyre giving the experts and thats a sad fact
1416953 and i know thats a paradox thats part of why i wanted to become a spokesperson so i could say please dont listen to me dont listen to the actors go to the experts

1416958 but he has good hockey sense which goes a long ways

1416965 if we use force it is only in cases where it is absolutely necessary to defend the lives of law enforcement officers
1416966 neither the ossetian nor the georgian people want war but someone is trying to provoke a conflict
1416967 subsequent to the issue of the visas to the students who live in the gaza strip we received additional information that we believe was pertinent and needed to be reviewed further before they were allowed entry into the united states
1416968 we did what we call a prudential revocation of their visas which is a safety precaution that we undertake to make sure that all potentially relevant facts about an alien are thoroughly explored before we admit that alien to the united states

1417028 if things continue heating up between the united states and iran i predict local motorists will be paying up to 5 a litre
1417029 the price of crude oil can rise and fall from one day to the next but if more pressure is placed on supply of oil especially from middle eastern countries then the price will definitely go up
1417030 drivers wont be able to afford that price which will mean that customers and the businesses themselves will suffer
1417031 being independent gives me the opportunity to set my own pricing
1417032 i take the wholesale price and add a small profit margin and we try to remain competitive with service stations in tweed heads which are normally cheaper as they are on the border and include a discount given to queensland motorists
1417033 through our community based system of care the well being of our children has become a priority to the people of the state of florida

1417035 this years achievements are a result of the dedication and commitment of our partners and community members

1417055 the stakes in this election are bigger than any one person and voters in our district deserve to have a democratic candidate on the ballot this november who can overcome the politics of personal attack
1417056 without him the democrats would not have a candidate on the ballot in this november

1417068 i visited the orwell creek site again on the weekend and all hes done is move an electric fence around the drain

1417070 we spotted several more we could not access in the same area one involves the pollution of a public water supply

1417072 were only looking at a very small sample of a very big area we dont have the resources were just concerned citizens westland milk products has to take responsibility and the monitoring responsibility lies with the west coast regional council and westland dairy company
1417073 were going to call on the government to intervene and ensure there is proper monitoring and enforcement of environmental laws for our region
1417074 with evidence like these photos which show a gross violation of health water and farming standards not to mention animal welfare i have to question the regional councils commitment to either the environment or the health of the residents of the west coast
1417075 considerando gli errori commessi in questi sette anni lfbi ha lobbligo di rendere pubbliche le prove contro ivins il congresso e i mezzi dinformazione devono poterle valutare se stato veramente ivins gli statunitensi tireranno un sospiro di sollievo significherebbe infatti che gruppi terroristici stranieri non sono ancora in grado di pianificare attacchi con lantrace ma il caso non ancora chiuso

1417082 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1417083 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores thus we have more energy and are generally emotionally healthier
1417084 the obama campaign has signaled for example through national finance chair penny pritzker that its going to rely more on traditional fund raising techniques from here on out than it did through the primaries
1417085 so their fund raising will be more of a balance between the small donor internet based fund raising and the traditional donor efforts and therefore the new york fund raising community is very important to the obama campaign and that campaign has been playing close attention to that community

1417088 a lot of people looked at his support for barack early in this race as a sign not only of how seriously barack would compete financially in new york but just how substantive of a candidate barack was and is because orin doesnt throw his support lightly

1417092 compared to a decade ago there are three million more people in work in britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past important minimum standards on wages paid leave maternity leave and conditions have been put in place
1417093 however as the forum found there are still dark corners of the labor market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1417094 we want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation
1417095 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law
1417096 this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law
1417097 with water production remaining very low there is no hope that zinwa will be able to bring back water supply to those areas that are already dry rather the water crisis is set to worsen as zinwas woes deepen

1417099 before pingg if hosts wanted to send event invitations to all of their guests they likely had to cobble together a distribution plan which often included individual emails text messages print invites for those who werent online parents amp grandparents and posts to facebook an unorganized and often time consuming process with pingg all these communication channels have been unified onto a single platform allowing hosts to send invitations any way they wish and manage their events and rsvps from one place something thats never been done before
1417100 integrating twitter functionality into the pingg platform allows us to provide hosts yet another way to easily and simply create plan and manage their events on the web as hosts continue to expand their communication channels as well as join new social networks we are prepared to expand and provide ways for them to send their invitations and manage their events across the platforms of their choice

1417123 nelson mandela bay is the first host city to have made significant progress in the appointment of a stadium operator this augurs well not only for the 2010 fifa world cup but importantly for the legacy and sustainability of the facility and its downstream beneficiation of stakeholders and the public at large
1417124 if managed properly by a professional stadium operator the nelson mandela bay stadium has the potential to be the preferred venue for a host of national and international events thereby positively contributing to our broader economic and tourism vision for the region
1417125 we are quite proud to have come so far in the progress of appointing an operator whose duty it will be to ensure that the nelson mandela bay stadium is an active contributor to the growth of nelson mandela bay not only through sport but also in its contribution to retail office conference events and adjacent property development
1417126 republicans have been escalating their attacks on democratic presidential candidate sen barack obama ill and the democrats over oil drilling and we need to push back hard

1417138 are at least as brainwashed by multiculturalism and political correctness as they ever were with communism
1417139 we let our guard down after the fall of the berlin wall and never properly denounced the ideology behind it
1417140 yet in the supposedly free west we are now taking part in a gigantic social experiment of multiculturalism and muslim immigration every bit as radical utopian and potentially dangerous as communism seeking to transform our entire society and still we refuse to even acknowledge that this is going on
1417141 the tenet of class hatred remained as popular as ever
1417142 attaching labels such as racist or even fascist to anyone criticizing massive immigration or multiculturalism
1417143 any right winger can be slimed with such accusations curiously enough the reverse is almost never true
1417144 there seems to be little stigma attached to being a radical leftist

1417166 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1417167 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1417168 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1417169 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1417170 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1417171 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1417172 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1417173 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1417174 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike

1417487 my mom told me about the camp and i heard it was a fun camp to go to the best part was getting to meet lots of other girls i didnt know before i definitely want to go back again next year
1417488 this workshop seemed to have the greatest impact on the girls
1417489 in the beginning this workshop was met with moans and groans because it was classroom style and learning based and of course no one wants to sit and listen to a lecture day in and day out however by the weeks end the majority of the campers were able to speak knowledgeably about starting owning and maintaining their own business
1417490 i really enjoyed this session and even got to participate in the fashion show
1417491 they talked to us about outfits and showed us clothes that looked good on our bodies and how not to wear clothes that are too small or dont fit right
1417492 the speakers talked about learning to treat yourself better and not to talk bad about other people
1417493 haley spoke to the girls on the importance of finding a mentor they can trust and talk about things they may be experiencing
1417494 sheryl spoke to the girls about respecting themselves and others through their communication outlets such as the way they speak dress and carry themselves in public
1417495 she motivated the girls to believe that they can be all they imagine themselves being and work diligently towards pursuing that dream
1417496 with any first day there were nervous jitters and uncertain expectations as the week went on the girls became more relaxed in the environment with the volunteers and the facilitators and the overall daily routine of sticking to an intense time schedule eight in the morning until three in the afternoon makes for a long day and they had lots to do see and learn during that short time frame
1417497 i remember looking at the groups performing and then scanning the crowd at the excitement and anticipation of the other campers as they cheered their friends on
1417498 the girls that were chosen to be in the talent show worked really hard in less than a weeks time to put together their best performance
1417499 the courage and strength these girls showed along with the support from their parents and peers made it all worthwhile they walked away feeling good about themselves and that is what the foundation ultimately stands for
1417500 i hope from this camp the girls walk away with a better sense of self new friendships and memories that will last throughout the year and that will have them checking the website all year long to sign up for next years camp early

1417565 hey i thought of you when i saw this and wanted to share
1417566 were worse off than we were four years ago then why did john mccain enthusiastically endorse and campaign for george w bush and vote for him 95 of the time
1417567 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed and bragged about supporting those policies more than 90 percent of time the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1417568 americans are now better off than we were eight years ago and that weve made great progress economically
1417569 john mccain says hell fix washington now thats double talk from mccain heres some straight talk he was in washington d c for 26 years and failed to lead on issues important to americans today he used to be a maverick now hes voted with bush 95 of the time in the past eight years and now is bought and paid for by the oil companies he has over 23 lobbyists from oil companies on his campaign thats not change we can afford to have barack obama isnt bought and paid for by lobbyists from oil companies he has a real plan to address the economic pain that millions of americans are feeling raising the gas mileage investing in renewable energy and creating a tax cut of 1000 for americans to help them with the rising cost of gas and groceries at home obamas tax cuts would benefit 85 of americans while mccains tax cuts benefit the top 5 of the richest like the oil company executives he now calls his friends vote for barack obama to effect real change for america i approve of this message and i know you do too
1417570 john mccain is looking for someone for vice president who has more economic expertise than he does so congratulations to all of you youre on the short list
1417571 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1417572 hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1417573 and while senator mccains plan wont save you at the pump anytime soon it sure has done a lot to raise campaign dollars
1417574 so to sum up under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1417575 thats the choice we face in this election we can choose four years more of the same failed policies that have gotten us where we are
1417576 or we can choose a new clean energy future that gets us where we need to be we can make a different bet a bet on the ingenuity industry and determination of the american people thats what im offering
1417577 because after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1417578 we all know that this is the great challenge of our time if we fail to act there the implications will be grave for our economy for our security for our planet
1417579 but if we seize this moment and meet the challenge we can open to door to a new economy for the 21st century that will bring new energy new jobs and new hope to youngstown and communities across ohio and this nation
1417580 the payoff from these investments in renewable energy sources will be renewable energy jobs across ohio and across america
1417581 finally i will call on businesses government and the american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 by the end of the next decade
1417582 mccains bought and paid for by the oil companies he has their interests at heart not yours thats not change we can afford to have in this country
1417583 the day after mccain flip flopped on offshore drilling guess what happened he got millions of dollars in contributions from oil companies he has their interests at heart not yours hes not going to change our addiction to foreign oil which sponsors terrorism in the middle east against our american soldiers its time to change its time to take the initiative and break off our desperate addiction on foreign oil lets work to create a new car that gets a 100 mile per gallon invest in renewable energies and a thousand dollar tax cut to help american families maintain their budgets at a time when grocery prices are going higher
1417584 john mccains just another republican in the pocket of big oil companies that make billions of dollars off the pain that americans feel at the gas pump
1417585 hes more of the same just like george w bush who hes supported 95 of the time
1417586 what john mccain is offering is nothing more than a third bush term on every issue
1417587 john mccain himself says he knows little about the economy
1417588 john mccains so out of touch on the economy his top economic adviser says were all just suffering a mental recession

1417592 if our recent experience is any indicator i think they are leaning to being more favorable to people who have an interest in carrying firearms to protect themselves
1417593 we dont see any common sense rationale for their positions given that there are so few requirements so few responsibilities that concealed weapon carry permit holders have in georgia
1417594 if you have no significant criminal history and you have 50 dollars you can get a permit
1417595 the idea that none of them have anger management issues that none of them periodically get drunk or get high or have some emotional issue i think that is a pretty wild claim that none of those 300 000 have been in that situation
1417596 its not about wanting to carry a gun in a park i dont think parks are necessarily less safe than anywhere else in the community

1417598 and so what i would say if there is somebody within the sound of my voice who has the time to do it find out where is it gordon whos the whats his name
1417599 find out where he lives find out where his office is if youve got some chutzpah which is a word that you dont hear often if youve really got it find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time call him a racist in signs if you see him call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time they cant take the heat deliver it to them we have to stop laying down to these injustices

1417602 i get extremely concerned for an agent or a prosecutor when someone says find out where he lives find out where his family goes to school at that point youve crossed the line
1417603 theres no telling what they might do with that kind of encouragement
1417604 people get heated up it is certainly a veiled threat
1417605 i dont know the details of the case i just know that a grave injustice is being done
1417606 has been using the eastern district of virginia to mete out his own brand of justice for muslim terrorism subjects often openly displaying his personal animus this long and controversial record forms the backdrop for the allegation of selective and malicious prosecution in this case
1417607 law enforcement is entitled to keep investigating a criminal enterprise even after one defendant is acquitted and if that defendant is presented with a subpoena and cloaked with the dual protections of court ordered immunity and the guarantee against double jeopardy he may well be required to admit the very conduct he successfully denied at trial

1417634 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
1417635 for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
1417636 because even if the co2 created in manufacturing is sequestered the fuel itself releases twice as much co2 as gasoline when combusted
1417637 thus a celebration of the violent ethnic cleansing of palestine in 1948 has been turned into a state subsidized fund raising event for an already wealthy community just how wealthy the expected nakba celebrants are can be seen by contrasting them with the general us population and the state fair neighborhood one of detroits more diverse but still majority black neighborhoods according to the detroit area jewish population study 2005 sponsored by the jewish federation of metropolitan detriot the median income of detroit area jewish households was 85 000 and median housing value was 300 000 the national figures for the general us population are median household income 45 000 median housing value 156 000 the comparable figures for the people living in the state fair neighborhood are even more striking median household income 24 016 median home sale value 73 000
1417638 the economic disparities described above are also strongly related to power disparities these disparities result in billions of dollars of direct us federal aid to israel more than 3 1 billion every year to israel on average 6 8 million per day while detroit languishes this of course doesnt include any of the hundreds of billions of dollars malignly misappropriated for invading and occupying iraq just since 2003 this is a war that even conservatives centrists such as colin powell scott ritter john j mearsheimer and stephen m walt suggest was at least partly a war for israel

1417702 the manner how the divine testimony is manifested to the heart i do not take upon me to explain such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me i cannot attain unto it the wind bloweth and i hear the sound thereof but i cannot tell how it cometh or whither it goeth as no one knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man that is in him so the manner of the things of god knoweth no one save the spirit of god but the fact we know namely that the spirit of god does give a believer such a testimony of his adoption

1417733 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically
1417734 and unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same hes offering a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy hes offering a gas tax holiday that will pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas over the course of an entire summer and hes offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that just recorded the largest profit in the history of the united states a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
1417735 instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices the only energy proposal hes really promoting is more offshore drilling this plan wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from this drilling for at least seven years and while senator mccains plan wont save you at the pump anytime soon it sure has done a lot to raise campaign dollars senator mccain raised more than one million dollars from the oil industry just last month most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling to a room full of cheering oil executives
1417736 so to sum up under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy because after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet we must end the age of oil in our time

1417809 this show takes place in the basement of the new stand venue at the police band social club the room is small and the surroundings sparse the comedian teddy aka ross craig is performing his first solo stand up show after ten years in the business and so was a bit nervous at the start of this preview show the show has a lot of strong language and an extended descriptive sex scene so its not one for the more sensitive types teddy is a local comedian and starts by checking if there are any non scots in the audience so he can give a few crib notes about local terms hell be using during the show he is a softly spoken performer and uses no props or other supports the show itself is a journey through the comedic career and romantic history of teddys life to see how the mistakes he made have got him from the small town of dunfermline to the heady heights of glasgow over the last decade we hear stories of his encounters with aggressive audience members demented pr people and a friend who he loves just that bit too much many of the stories told are emotionally fraught and you can see how teddy is reliving some of them as he tells them and these parts of the show connected well with the audience there were parts of his routine though where he went off on a tangent to deliberately set up tales which were extremely sexist and these i felt were very jarring notes in the routine they didnt carry the narrative of his tale and appeared to have been introduced to either break the audiences concentration or to allow teddy to keep from crying on stage the centrepiece of his show was the tale of his un requited love for an old friend over the last decade and how she really fried his heart over an extended period of time its a deeply painful story of love lust and heartbreak woven through the thread of experiences on the comedy stage so the show as a whole was a good start as a solo piece and once his nerves subside and he tones down the really offensive and not very funny asides this will be one to see if youre into tales of heartbreak and despair

1417822 as a parent what are some of lifes lessons you want your children to learn
1417823 to learn that they cannot make anyone love them all they can do is let themselves be loved to learn that it is not good to compare themselves to others to learn to forgive by practicing forgiveness to learn that it only takes a few seconds to open profound wounds in those they love and it can take many years to heal them to learn that a rich person is not one who has the most but is the one who needs the least to that there are people who love them dearly but simply do not yet know how to express or show their feelings to learn that two people can look at the same thing and see it differently to learn that it is not enough that they forgive one another but they must also forgive themselves

1417836 brasidas after the capture of amphipolis marched with his allies against acte a promontory running out from the kings dike with an inward curve and ending in athos a lofty mountain looking towards the aegean sea in it are various towns sane an andrian colony close to the canal and facing the sea in the direction of euboea the others being thyssus cleone acrothoi olophyxus and dium inhabited by mixed barbarian races speaking the two languages there is also a small chalcidian element but the greater number are tyrrheno pelasgians once settled in lemnos and athens and bisaltians crestonians and edonians the towns being all small ones
1417837 danaus who was the father of fifty daughters having arrived in argos inhabited the city of inachus and made a law that those who had before borne the name of pelasgiot throughout greece should be called danai
1417838 then after this he cr sus gave thought to inquire which people of the hellenes he should esteem the most powerful and gain over to himself as friends and inquiring he found that the lacedemonians and the athenians had the pre eminence the first of the dorian and the others of the ionian race for these were the most eminent races in ancient time the second being a pelasgian and the first a hellenic race and the one never migrated from its place in any direction while the other was very exceedingly given to wanderings for in the reign of deucalion this race dwelt in pthiotis and in the time of doros the son of hellen in the land lying below ossa and olympos which is called histiaiotis and when it was driven from histiaiotis by the sons of cadmos it dwelt in pindos and was called makedonian and thence it moved afterwards to dryopis and from dryopis it came finally to peloponnesus and began to be called dorian as for the hellenic race it has used ever the same language as i clearly perceive since it first took its rise but since the time when it parted off feeble at first from the pelasgian race setting forth from a small beginning it has increased to that great number of races which we see and chiefly because many barbarian races have been added to it besides moreover it is true as i think of the pelasgian race also that so far as it remained barbarian it never made any great increase
1417839 as for the athenians in the time when the pelasgians occupied that which is now called hellas they were pelasgians being named cranaoi and in the time of king kecrops they came to be called kecropidai then when erechtheus had succeeded to his power they had their name changed to athenians and after ion the son of xuthos became commander of the athenians they got the name from him of ionians
1417840 these observances then and others besides these which i shall mention the hellenes have adopted from the egyptians but to make as they do the images of hermes with the phallos they have learnt not from the egyptians but from the pelasgians the custom having been received by the athenians first of all the hellenes and from these by the rest for just at the time when the athenians were beginning to rank among the hellenes the pelasgians became dwellers with them in their land and from this very cause it was that they began to be counted as hellenes whosoever has been initiated in the mysteries of the cabeiroi which the samothrakians perform having received them from the pelasgians that man knows the meaning of my speech for these very pelasgians who became dwellers with the athenians used to dwell before that time in samothrake and from them the samothrakians received their mysteries so then the athenians were the first of the hellenes who made the images of hermes with the phallos having learnt from the pelasgians and the pelasgians told a sacred story about it which is set forth in the mysteries in samothrake now the pelasgians formerly were wont to make all their sacrifices calling upon the gods in prayer as i know from that which i heard at dodona but they gave no title or name to any of them for they had not yet heard any but they called them gods from some such notion as this that they had set in order all things and so had the distribution of everything afterwards when much time had elapsed they learnt from egypt the names of the gods all except dionysos for his name they learnt long afterwards and after a time the pelasgians consulted the oracle at dodona about the names for this prophetic seat is accounted to be the most ancient of the oracles which are among the hellenes and at that time it was the only one so when the pelasgians asked the oracle at dodona whether they should adopt the names which had come from the barbarians the oracle in reply bade them make use of the names from this time they sacrificed using the names of the gods and from the pelasgians the hellenes afterwards received them
1417841 now miltiades son of kimon had thus taken possession of the lemnos after the pelasgians had been cast out of attica by the athenians whether justly or unjustly for about this i cannot tell except the things reported which are these hecataois on the one hand the son of hegesander said in his history that it was done unjustly for he said that when the athenians saw the land which extends below hymettos which they had themselves given them to dwell in as payment for the wall built round the acropolis in former times when the athenians i say saw that this land was made good by cultivation which before was bad and worthless they were seized with jealousy and with longing to possess the land and so drove them out not alleging any other pretext but according to the report of the athenians themselves they drove them out justly for the pelasgians being settled under hymettos made this a starting point and committed wrong against them as follows the daughters and sons of the athenians were wont ever to go for water to the spring of enneacrunos for at that time neither they nor the other hellenes as yet had household servants and when these girls came the pelasgians in wantonness and contempt of the athenians would offer them violence and it was not enough for them even to do this but at last they were found in the act of plotting an attack upon the city and the narrators say that they herein proved themselves better men than the pelasgians inasmuch as when they might have slain the pelasgians who had been caught plotting against them they did not choose to do so but ordered them merely to depart out of the land and thus having departed out of the land the pelasgians took possession of several older places and especially of lemnos the former story is that which was reported by hecataios while the latter is that which is told by the athenians
1417842 conservatively were in general referred in classic greece and afterwards to pre hellenic populations of dubious greek mainland origins and who spoke several non greek languages who settled down in the greek

1417847 my time with wolves has come to an end but i still finished last season on a high with that open top bus tour with stoke city at the end of my loan period there it was fantastic to be a part of their promotion celebrations

1417878 i came away from the last round quite frustrated as i really wanted to get another win for the airwaves ducati team but its made me more determined to kick up a gear and get back onto the top step of the podium ive worked with my engineer on the gearing of my airwaves ducati 1098r so im confident well have a good set up for the weekend ive also been training really hard over the past couple of weeks so im feeling in great shape which is going to be really important over these last few rounds of the championship
1417879 oulton park was a massive disappointment for me but since the moment we decided not to race my focus has been on getting back aboard the airwaves ducati its been good to have a few weeks off to fully recover but im glad to be heading to knockhill its a circuit that i am confident the airwaves ducati can perform well at my aim this weekend is to get my championship back on track so i need to secure some strong results for the airwaves ducati team and get onto the podium

1417884 that was a tough race made much tougher from such a bad start
1417885 its so hard to pass around here that you just cant afford to blow the start not in this company anyway im glad i could fight back onto the podium but im disappointed i couldnt get away with these guys at the front as we had the speed to win today
1417886 im obviously really disappointed with the weekends results as i think we couldve given vlad and arne a run for their money had we been a bit more fortunate
1417887 but thats racing and it just shows that anything can happen on race day
1417888 this weekend hurt our championship aspirations but like ive said all along this year was about getting on the map and weve done that
1417889 there are still 4 races left so im just going to improve my starts and give it plenty of throttle from here on in
1417890 i just got into a rhythm and focused on keeping my distance from fourth place i know we are going to atlanta to test and im really looking forward to trying some new things
1417891 we had a little issue with the bike i went down the back straight away on second lap and the rear started hopping so bad i couldnt make the corner or use the brakes we tried a few things to fix it but we werent sure what it is well figure it out for next race its unfortunate because we went so much better in practice today but thats a part of racing and we will move on to virginia and try to do better there
1417892 i felt that we could have done a lot better today
1417893 though with the way things have gone in this class i am glad to finish the race and get some points on the board i really think that virginia could be good for us and im looking forward to it
1417894 with the qualifying spot that we got i felt that i did the best i could with what i had on the start
1417895 it was a good race but i did get run off the track when roger and danny eslick went down in front of me that slowed me up but i managed to get by to ninth it could have been a lot worse
1417896 i knew jake was right there and had the race not been shortened i dont know if i would have managed to stave him off in fact he had just gotten by me prior to the red flag so the results could have easily been different im definitely pumped as this was my first win of the season and hopefully it is the start of being able to turn things around
1417897 it was really a good race with lots of passing the fans definitely got a good show i came into this round with the goal of leaving with a full race points lead and we did that and thats what was important josh really rode well and im glad for him

1418045 ive just listened to your shows from september last year onwards listening to snc is like listening to pc podcast with the weirdness increased by a factor of 10 you play some very um shall we say interesting music a lot of it i wouldnt play myself but having said that ive lined up luna halo and two hours traffic to play on my show
1418046 here are a few tunes for listening or playing at home or better dancing in a jig simple wish to share these old tunes of our heritage and to add my own tunes by the way recorded on the corner on the living room table no complicated things nor fantastic modernity in that
1418047 akin to the sensation of having a frenchman inside your head
1418048 as the entire music industry scrambles to redefine what it means to be a band in the 21st century when its not as much about record labels throwing money around and radio spinning a tune to a mass audience who will in turn run out and buy the albums as it is about finding an audience the old diy way of playing

1418075 whether its albany or washington the system is broken because lobbyists and special interests have a stranglehold on our government
1418076 on the national level barack obama has put the issue of the influence of lobbyists at the forefront lobbyists are writing our energy policies lobbyists are holding up a national healthcare policy the same holds true for albany
1418077 we need a representative in washington who is not beholden to these powerful special interests
1418078 the people should be represented by someone who will put their interests first and who wont let lobbyists drown out their voices
1418079 while there certainly are lobbyists who champion progressive causes we need to revamp the whole system because our government is broken
1418080 too much money is changing hands behind the scenes in and around government for special favors increased access or to kill a piece of legislation

1418089 chinese factories reported a plunge in new orders last month exports are barely growing the real estate market is weakening
1418090 with oil prices beginning to soften there may be a chance for them to give a boost to the economy by lowering rates again
1418091 it think its still in the cards but no one really knows
1418092 i think it would be premature for the fed to ease rates further the fed has used new mechanisms including the term auction facility and the term securities lending facility to help maintain financial system liquidity and the orderly function of markets and so as long as no further stress events occur in the credit markets i think they should stand pat on rates
1418093 the fed needs more data before it can reach an informed reasonable decision on interest rate direction
1418094 i know there are some fed members who would love to raise rates but that would not be wise given the weak u s economy on the other hand im sure there are fed board members whod love to cut rates as well but theyll have a tough case to make against the hawks given trending higher inflation
1418095 may give the fed some room to lower rates in the fall if inflation pressures ease in tandem with lower oil prices
1418096 right now mobius is a little premature in calling for a 1 rate

1418137 im listening to this weeks show and i heard you asking why artists dont have the sell option enabled for their tracks personally ive enabled the sell option for my tunes but for those who havent the only reason i can think of is that if people can buy the individual songs they like then they might not buy the album so if the only way to get a hold of the tracks is to buy the album then maybe that will help sell more cds i could be completely wrong right enough but its the only reason i can think of i dont think the downloads on the podsafenetwork would really effect cd sales i think most of the listeners on the network are people who support independant music so if they like the music enough then theyll buy the cd im 4 songs into recording my album and its something that id thought about i think probably ill make some stuff available for sale but not all and also keep back a few tunes so that people will get some stuff theyve not heard before if they buy the album
1418138 so maybe its difficult to set up or the contract has a few nasty surprises for artists
1418139 im pleased to say i never saw any nasty surprises on the pmn agreement the whole pmn thing seems great for independant artists its one thing posting your tunes on the net but getting people to actually listen to your stuff is another thing altogether which is where the podcasts really help now that tv and commercial radio has been taken over by all the manufactured pop idol and x factor type stuff the internet is the place where the independant artists can market themselves so all is not lost were not all doomed to listen to whatever simon cowell tells us we want to hear for the rest of our lives

1418143 more than a quarter of young people in the uk are prepared to illegally download music and films because they distrust the entertainment industry according to research a survey by pr group edelman found that 41 of 18 to 34 year olds do not trust the entertainment industry to provide value for money and 34 do not trust companies to respect the rights of those who do pay for digital content the research found that 27 of young people have already downloaded content illegally or would do so resentment over the perceived high cost of digital services and usability problems such as incompatible formats for example ipod users only being able to play music downloaded from apples itunes has contributed to this distrust

1418148 the secret affinity between gambling and the desert gambling itself is a desert form inhuman uncultured initiatory a challenge to the natural economy of value a crazed activity on the fringes of exchange but it also has a strict limit and stops abruptly its boundaries are exact its passion knows no confusion neither the desert nor gambling are open areas their spaces are finite and concentric increasing in intensity toward the interior toward a central point be it the spirit of gambling or the heart of the desert a privileged immemorial space where things lose their shadow where money loses its value and where the extreme rarity of traces of what signals to us there leads men to seek the instantaneity of wealth

1418420 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1418421 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1418422 when you lose a guy whos been here a while its always a shock maybe well start rolling now
1418423 he pitched great until the hit then kind of just lost it from that point on
1418424 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1418425 i want to play that game you know they all go whirly round and you click on them and they vanish
1418426 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
1418427 i will request that the b sample gets tested as i have never taken drugs in my life and i dont know about this drug

1418433 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george coming back tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationary and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals saying you may not like this but here is our next mission and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish ultimately people even talked about it after the fact it was a dark day for the cia it was the kind of thing where they said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forward a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1418434 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector working with state and local governments to achieve a single overarching goal in ten years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1418435 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution what ive said is im willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1418436 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their recess come off their vacation and address this energy challenge to america and dont leave until we do republican and democrat joining together and a very vital part of that is nuclear power and another vital part of that is offshore drilling we have to drill here and drill now
1418437 im not satisfied in part because i think they havent been as forthcoming not only with me but with the american people about the status of this investigation i also havent seen the evidence and i think that given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical

1418448 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

1418452 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1418453 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1418454 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1418455 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
1418456 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
1418457 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
1418458 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
1418459 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
1418460 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
1418461 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

1418469 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1418470 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1418471 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention
1418472 when i stood there and looked at that packbot i realized that if that robot hadnt been there it would have been some kid

1418478 we gave them a good overview of the efforts that have been going on here for the past sixty days in an effort to achieving the effects of improving the quality of life for the citizens of sadr city within oe operating environment gold
1418479 i think there has been significant improvement in this gold sector i noticed on the wall separating this area of sadr city from the rest of the city there are still signs of heavy fighting and the general conditions in sadr city are poor and that basic services are not widely available
1418480 however ill say that these units that are coming in are making a dramatic improvement and you can see that in the amount of traffic a lot of the shop owners are moving back in the security situation has improved greatly at least this area where we have coalition forces
1418481 this is a critical time this is a critical place and the work that everyone is engaged in from the security piece to the reconstruction piece to the assistance piece is all really going to achieve the same effect which is a sustainable peace for the people of sadr city
1418482 i met him face to face i talked to him eye to eye and he is genuinely concerned about us
1418483 the mission im doing means a lot to the army and to them back home
1418484 you get a sense of pride when somebody from your state does come out and talk to you he didnt have to come out i know he has a busy schedule
1418485 i told him i know you are very busy and i appreciate you coming out to spend a couple of minutes with me and he said the same for me
1418486 it meant a lot that somebody from the states from my state came and said hello i appreciate your duty i appreciate your mission and keep up the good work this made me feel good all around

1418497 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1418498 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1418499 there is very much an interest in moving the financing from us to the iraqis in terms of the united states no longer being involved in the physical reconstruction business
1418500 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1418501 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1418502 they have spent less than 30 percent of the 12 2 billion budgeted for capitol improvements this year

1418534 they the main stream media dont want our input because they think we are stupid and we cant tell them anything only they can enlighten us
1418535 this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1418536 do you suppose anyone from nbc or cbs monitors this site ya think theyre getting the message i dont see one comment here that presumes that obama will win the election and fix everything we taxpayers need to vote and get the republicans back in power i think theyre beginning to listen
1418537 this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1418538 you people are nuts the repubs havent done anything in seven years nobody has the equipment to drill they already have millions of acres that could have been drilling in for years now but the repub backed oil companys havent drilled one hole plus what good does more oil do when they dont have the facilities to process it they havent built a refinery in 30 years why not because they want to control the amount of gas out there and thus make more and more billions blame you damn repubs not anyone else repub house members are a joke but they wont be in office after nov bye bye boys

1418548 tijdens de bijeenkomst heeft icann wel meegegeven dat de aanvraag voor een eigen achtervoegsel zeker honderdduizend euro zal bedragen daarnaast moeten er keiharde garanties worden gegeven dat de aanvrager technisch in staat is om die domeinnamen te beheren
1418549 in eerste instantie zullen merkenhouders de mogelijkheid hebben om hun extensie te registreren
1418550 we denken daarbij vooral aan gemeentes die enerzijds voor zichzelf domeinnamen willen registreren zoals www toerisme gent of www politie gent ook bedrijven zouden elke lokale vestiging een domeinnaam kunnen geven zoals bijvoorbeeld www antwerpen scapa
1418551 er is immers een mogelijkheid om de kostprijs van honderdduizend euro terug te verdienen want wie in het bezit is van een eigen extensie mag domeinnamen onder die extensie verkopen voor een zelfgekozen prijs

1418554 but whos really out of touch the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 bbl per day by 2030 we use about 20 million bbl per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1418555 in early 2003 in secret meetings with british intelligence habbush revealed that iraq in fact did not have weapons of mass destruction
1418556 that would come to define americas posture in the world bushs powerful confidence in his instinct
1418557 bush with his distaste for analysis and those who contradict him didnt go down those paths and he seemed unconcerned unlike other presidents that isolation would prompt errors in judgment
1418558 its a diabolical twist worthy of sophocles or shakespeare either would have written it as a tragedy because over the years the bullying presence of bush making things personal without hesitation or limits became the face of america after eventful years and bushs re election the nation and its leader became inseparable as america itself was viewed as angry reckless petulant and insecure spoiled and careless with a false smile that concealed boiling hostility

1418577 worse mr moses has been convicted of pollut ing a spawning area for yellowstone cutthroat trout despite the fact that there have been no fish in this stream bed for more than 150 years
1418578 a resident who has lived near the flood channel for 18 years says he has never seen fish in this stream bed and its not even possible for the stream bed to serve as a spawning ground since it only has water two months out of every year in the first place
1418579 the county said you have got to take care of this flooding or we will not let you build
1418580 the u s attorney told him to take a hike since the corps had no jurisdictional authority to initiate legal action
1418581 according to former state legislator lee gagner the corps discussed his process many times with him but could not show where they had jurisdiction on the seasonal intermittent stream gagner adds t o this day they do not have written rules indicating this to be true
1418582 the waters of the united states does not include channels through which water flows intermittently or ephemerally or channels that periodically provide drainage for rainfall
1418583 mr moses has been forced to spend almost 400 000 of his own money in a losing effort to defend himself for protecting the city of driggs from catastrophic flooding
1418584 teton county required him to implement an engineers plan to modify the teton creek stream bed to prevent the flooding of subdivision property caused by the buildup of gravel bars and downed trees during high water flows in the spring
1418585 for years he has walked the entire length of the creek to evaluate conditions and then remove gravel bars sand logs and debris as necessary to keep the channel clear and satisfy the subdivisions obligation to the county
1418586 when driggs flooded in the spring of 1981 due to a clogged culvert under a county road the county approached the corps a second time asking for funding and help to replace the culvert with a bridge to prevent future flooding once again the corps said nope not our problem not our fault not our responsibility to fix we dont have jurisdiction
1418587 although the director of the epa in idaho jim wernitz asserts that mr moses had damaged wetlands associated with the stream there are no wetlands there the very word requires that land be well wet but the stream bed is bone dry for at least 10 months out of every year
1418588 his attorney calls the whole thing a travesty which is just about the mildest thing that can be said about this unconscionable miscarriage of justice
1418589 but if immigration policies allow newcomers to fundamentally alter the cultural values that have made america the envy of the world and results in the balkanization of american society instead of preserving its unity not only will our children and grandchildren suffer as a result we will lose our capacity to carry out the unique redemptive purpose god has assigned to it is my judgment that uncontrolled immigration is threatening our national unity fundamentally altering the dna of our culture and dimming the light of our
1418590 words like unity and dna serve as code words if you were of a mind to you could read this as saying we have to preserve the purity of our race
1418591 i believe the united states similarly has a redemptive purpose and while we may disagree in some particulars most people of faith believe that part of that redemptive purpose involves being the
1418592 however in early democracies as in the american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature that is freedom was given to the individual conditionally in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years two hundred or even 50 years ago it would have seemed quite impossible in america that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims subsequently however all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the west a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice state systems were becoming increasingly and totally materialistic the west ended up by truly enforcing human rights sometimes even excessively but mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer

1418811 ill be happy if we can get 2 to 3 percent more efficiency
1418812 its not like solar is trying to take the place of oil
1418813 but if in 20 to 30 years solar can provide 5 to 10 percent of the world energy supply then solar would be a huge industry bigger than the entire microelectronics industry

1418837 we are very pleased with the results so far as the drilling indicates parallel veins that have excellent mining widths show strong continuity and are high grade in value when we achieve our near term target of 1 3 million gold equivalent ounces our longer term stated target of 2 million gold equivalent ounces may increase based on our better understanding of the el aguila propertys potential
1418838 we will continue exploration drilling beyond our current delineation focus to determine what the actual size and extent of mineralization might be at the arista deposit but it is very exciting to see the potential for arista areas not yet drilled to have the possibility to double in vertical extent and equally also double the lateral extent of these veins in addition to the arista deposit potential there are 4 or 5 additional high grade veins in the immediate arista area such as the aire vein the many geomagnetic anomalies on this project yet to be tested and the remaining exploration potential on the 95 of the el aguila projects land concession that has not yet been explored
1418839 with the soon to be completed initial definition of mineralized material drilled at a portion of the arista deposit we will have the basis to begin our underground mine design our goal is to begin driving the decline for the arista deposits underground mine at the same time as we begin to generate cash flow from our first 12 months of production at the aguila projects high grade open pit and we are particularly excited to begin a broader exploration program to see just how large the mineralization at the aguila project could be

1418893 like media i have a right to protect the identity of my source
1418894 it was later pointed out to me that the visual of somebody called sanjeev saxena entering argals house as shown in the cd was shot after july 22 if this is the case then the matter becomes all the more serious as it shows that both congress and bjp are united on the issue of nuclear deal
1418895 they both are pro us and therefore in favour of the deal had the government fallen they would have ensured that the deal comes through left is against the deal as it is anti us
1418896 if a party of double standards like bjp comes to power again it would be a dangerous situation
1418897 all the people said taufik you are crazy like you are just coming out of hospital and the next day you are training but i say im okay although i only had one week for training

1418916 upa has been incompetent in defending the ban on simi this reflects the real face of the government and its soft attitude towards terrorism
1418917 simi is terrorism and terrorism is simi the co relation is known to all the government is shying away from the fact and endangering the civil society by its soft approach to terror
1418918 the home ministry has completely failed to convince the judiciary of simis role in the vicious terror circle faced by the country the prime minister should sack such a home minister who does not deserve to be at the place and the responsibility which he holds
1418919 the home ministrys notification should tell what leads you to declare simi a banned organisation
1418920 what precluded it from stating the facts you have to satisfy the tribunal about the sufficiency of the reason behind issuing a fresh notification on the ban
1418921 earlier we issued notification and then the malegaon blasts happened simi still indulges in communal activities and it is a threat to the secular fabric of our society
1418922 number one i believe in vaccinating our daughters and health i know theres a lot of controversy around vaccinations i dont believe in all of them i believe they need some of them

1418926 i am not here to beg for anything if he srk has committed a crime he should realise he has to personally apologise to me in my 50 years of work i have never held a press conference or hired a pr person i have been extremely tolerant but if someone hits me below the belt it is unpardonable the film shows me being lathicharged at a film premiere because the police fail to distinguish me from an impersonator can the mumbai police hit a known star in a public place it is like saying anyone can impersonate shah rukh khan and the real srk can be lathicharged for trying to attend the premiere of his own movie how can i accept such humiliation
1418927 we are not aware of these developments our legal department will decide on the action to be taken

1418940 although it was an honor to be selected as a team member with such an elite group of companies petrosun has chosen to go down a separate path in order to expedite the potential of algae being processed into a commercial jet fuel

1418942 the increased production in 2009 is a further example of sherwoods relentless pursuit of value for its shareholders
1418943 more production sooner should mean more value for our shareholders
1418944 further the previously announced 50 increase in mineral resources at the high grade minto mine is a very positive development the significantly increased mineral resource suggests potential for a longer mine life and or further increases in production beyond the rescheduled production announced today however the first time disclosure of substantial mineral resources at lower cut off grades which still results in mineral resource grades well above any operating copper mine in western canada provides a glimpse of what could be a materially larger opportunity at the minto mine and is something that warrants continued investigation
1418945 the financial analysis for the minto project demonstrates a robust project in all scenarios
1418946 using the current forward curve for copper and flat precious metal prices the minto mine generates an exceptionally positive cash flow there are opportunities to further increase project npv through the conversion of the mineral resources discovered and delineated in 2007 and 2008 to reserves the process for which is underway
1418947 given that the available mineral resource estimate has increased by 50 since the resource estimate used in the pfs and that a 25 000m drill program is underway to upgrade the confidence in and expand these resources a new pre feasibility study is warranted to evaluate the economic potential of these new resources once the 2008 drill program is completed
1418948 there is excellent potential for both an increased mine life and further increases in production given the tremendous exploration success at the high grade minto copper gold mine
1418949 while the overall grades in the resource estimates above are lower than currently being mined at the minto mine they average approximately twice that of currently operating copper mines in british columbia
1418950 these resources would require additional work to demonstrate positive economics nevertheless they do suggest an interesting opportunity for a considerably larger scale operation than would be contemplated at the higher cut off grades currently being used further these resource estimates encompass only a modest portion of what may be a much larger mineralized system further drilling is required to evaluate the potential continuity of the large untested areas between the currently defined mineral resources
1418951 clients have often mentioned the difficulty they have in communicating what they would like to improve about themselves and their confusion over not only which procedures would garner the best results but also what other options are available to achieve their beauty and wellness goals blue was founded on the principle of making the most innovative medi beauty procedures available to all and tiptotoe reflects that spirit blue medi spa developed tiptotoe to make all aesthetic services accessible through one point of contact this is no mere consultation this is relationship building at its finest

1418977 at first id think im healthy im a good weight i keep fit i dont drink i dont smoke ive never done drugs i dont even take painkillers
1418978 it was hard because it seemed there was no reason
1418979 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
1418980 for years architects and designers have been prescriptively defining this idea
1418981 what they have missed was that this is not a problem with prescriptive solutions
1418982 could help scientists make better estimates of how much carbon is in the atmosphere and help them decipher its effect on global climate change
1418983 sie werden zur selben zeit gef ttert sie essen alle drei stunden und ich werde immer besser darin ihnen gleichzeitig die br ste zu geben das hilft

1418986 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1418987 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1418988 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1418989 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1418990 inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1418991 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1418992 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1418993 tijdens de bijeenkomst heeft icann wel meegegeven dat de aanvraag voor een eigen achtervoegsel zeker honderdduizend euro zal bedragen daarnaast moeten er keiharde garanties worden gegeven dat de aanvrager technisch in staat is om die domeinnamen te beheren
1418994 in eerste instantie zullen merkenhouders de mogelijkheid hebben om hun extensie te registreren
1418995 we denken daarbij vooral aan gemeentes die enerzijds voor zichzelf domeinnamen willen registreren zoals www toerisme gent of www politie gent ook bedrijven zouden elke lokale vestiging een domeinnaam kunnen geven zoals bijvoorbeeld www antwerpen scapa
1418996 er is immers een mogelijkheid om de kostprijs van honderdduizend euro terug te verdienen want wie in het bezit is van een eigen extensie mag domeinnamen onder die extensie verkopen voor een zelfgekozen prijs
1418997 wie een leuk achtervoegsel weet te bemachtigen zoals porno movies of web kan natuurlijk al beginnen te dromen van een miljonairsbestaan
1418998 of op zijn minst toch erg voorbarig we zullen pas later dit jaar een draft request for proposal over deze materie uitwerken er ligt op dit moment dus nog geen enkele procedure vast
1418999 natuurlijk zijn bedrijven die bij ons een preregistratie zullen doen niet zeker of ze dat bewuste domein verkrijgen maar dat was indertijd ook voor be namen niet het geval
1419000 we could get 3 to 5 inches of rain but the ground is dry and i dont think that will be a major issue

1419002 most boat owners are moving loose debris putting out extra bumpers doubling lines checking batteries and topping off freshwater in case something happens with the water lines here
1419003 until all the danger is past and then well start bringing it back up
1419004 obviously were ready to make adjustments if the weather changes but at this point we dont see any impact on our production
1419005 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia

1419015 in talking to most of the contractors my understanding is a lot of them work with the philippines its not necessarily just the philippines but thats one of the sources
1419016 officers entered the wrong apartment without identifying themselves for no justified reason and for no lawful justification shot kevin three times
1419017 it defies any logic that mr wicks a postal service employee who had just passed his exam to become a corrections employee would open the door and point a gun at officers
1419018 it doesnt pass the smell test were convinced that this was an illegal use of deadly force
1419019 its just going to get funnier and funnier as the evening goes on

1419034 were not expecting a whole lot of change at this meeting
1419035 the greater risk is still to the downside in the growth
1419036 the inflation risks are receding and thats a big help
1419037 curious what they will say in the policy statement i expect they will talk about the downside risks to the economy and that inflation risks remain elevated the fed is looking at both closely
1419038 i dont see the fed changing policy until next spring when i expect to see them start to raise rates
1419039 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families

1419049 como lo hemos dicho en en varias ocasiones nuestra pol tica en la medida de lo posible es darle a todos los medios la informaci n de forma r pida y oportuna cuando se presenta este tipo de filtraciones no es producto de una prden o intenci n deliberada
1419050 es grave que integrantes de las fuerzas armadas filtren noticias de manera clandestina y sin coordinaci n con sus superiores
1419051 el presidente reitera la necesidad de permitir que todos los medios de comunicaci n tengan igual y oportuno acceso a las noticias m s importantes
1419052 he was really brave when he handed her to us i thought she would be covered in bruises but she was okay it was just the biggest relief ever

1419061 conspiracy is very pleased to do business with eminent international partners such as black bean this agreement with black bean provides us the opportunity to take a wildly successful international release and establish a us market from the very beginning
1419062 our very important state tourism industry continues to grow even as the national economy is struggling
1419063 tourism is a key economic driver particularly for several of our rural and urban counties and plays a critical role in adding new jobs to our economy and supports our other economic development efforts
1419064 bud cardwell and jack yarbrough were looking to retire for two or three years
1419065 they were hoping to sell the business to another florist but that just didnt work out
1419066 im not an economist but it seems obvious that were going through whats called a market adjustment right now
1419067 and im pretty sure its all related to the price of gas
1419068 not too long ago we had plenty of people with disposable incomes that created a better market for small retailers
1419069 now people are having to spend so much more of their income disposable or otherwise on gasoline theres not much left over for things that cant be classified as necessities
1419070 the plumbers hourly rate may not have changed but almost everything he uses is tied in some way to petroleum products and that means it has all gone up in price
1419071 it even cost him almost double to drive to your house than it did a year ago
1419072 reports indicate that even the big box stores have seen their sales fall off in recent months
1419073 when you see that as well as banks and mortgage companies suffering you know there are some serious problems to overcome with the economy
1419074 we were blessed for a lot of years to have one of the most creative and attractive downtowns in the area
1419075 the economic climate made it possible of small business owners to be successful when people were able to spend more on non essentials
1419076 when it comes down to buying something for the house or putting gas in the car or paying for heating fuel the retail purchase is always going to lose
1419077 we weathered the downturns in the 90s and early 2000s when we suffered so many layoffs and closings
1419078 we even saw a lot of new businesses open during that time now its the rising fuel costs that hit us but well make it through that as well
1419079 the town has funds in the budget for a number of facade grants up to 500 to help business owners make renovations or improvements to their building

1419086 if you could do anything tomorrow what would it be
1419087 heres our essential how to double your conversion rate guide with 108 simple surefire techniques for doubling your web business but when your conversion rate does increase we recommend you dont just sit back and enjoy the profits tempting as that might be instead we recommend you take advantage of the fact you can now afford to pay twice as much per visitor this means i you can pay about twice as much per click on adwords which can bring over ten times more visitors ii you can start advertising in media that had previously been too expensive for you iii your affiliates can earn twice as much as before so the super affiliate big boys start wanting to sell your product so in summary the total number of orders goes nuts
1419088 the report confirms the rudd governments commitment to ensuring payments and working arrangements support families choices
1419089 we understand the significant pressures on working families including the costs of raising children and the need to gear family support to the best interests of children
1419090 the breakdown of her marriage has had a profound effect on her
1419091 the pressures of public life constant travel away from home and public scrutiny combined with motherhood is a difficult act to balance
1419092 i have spent several hours with paula in hospital since last night she is a strong person and is showing good signs
1419093 mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas health issues
1419094 paulas health recovery will be a long process and she is getting all of the support she needs with her family and friends by her side every step along the way

1419096 restrict or prohibit the import export distribution exchange or sale
1419097 were excited to be the first vendor to bring that ssd technology to the mid tier storage systems
1419098 its not just about speed flash drives require a lot less energy they weigh a lot less than traditional spinning media
1419099 i think that the fact that it includes fibre channel and iscsi formats makes it more flexible
1419100 the ds4000 is not offering that natively and neither is the eva
1419101 earlier this year we introduced flash drives on symmetrix now were adding flash drives to the clariion systems as well
1419102 this is what we call tier 0 storage extremely fast flash drives
1419103 were talking about 30 times the performance at 22 times the cost
1419104 if disks arent being used we put them in an inactive state thereby requiring less energy
1419105 you would only want to do this for certain types of applications backups being one
1419106 when the system is not running as fast or as hot it will dynamically cool the environment and not run the fans at as high a level
1419107 we have separated the i o module from the cpu module this allows us to add hot pluggable i o connections
1419108 customers can now add new fibre channel connectivity on the fly without bringing the system down to do it
1419109 as new technologies come in in the future such as 8 gbit s fibre channel and 10 gig ethernet customers will be able to buy an i o module and plug that right into the system themselves
1419110 were leveraging the celerra virtual provisioning code that has been out in the marketplace for several years
1419111 the application thinks that it has more storage than it does
1419112 we also include safety features that provide monitoring capability to let customers know when and where they are close to running out of storage
1419113 and we have integrated clariions replication technologies such as recoverpoint and mirrorview with vmwares
1419114 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature

1419118 mental illness is responsible for 13 3 per cent of the total burden of disease in australia and so is clearly one of the most significant conditions for the nation
1419119 one of the most masterly sleight of hand techniques in the world
1419120 it is time to realise that we have not inherited this planet from our ancestors but are borrowing it for our children
1419121 the world is on the brink of a second nuclear age and a period of unprecedented climate change
1419122 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
1419123 we need a revolution to protect the beauty of our planet a revolution to secure the future of our children we need a revolution now for us
1419124 successful movements arent built on guilt they are built on passion
1419125 it feels instinctively true that we are a nasty over polluting species

1419127 most importantly we simply have to tackle the single greatest threat facing mankind climate change

1419130 upon reaching the post season a team must win three straight series to win the title this is the type of info that you just cant get at other websites
1419131 t he only way this will materialize into a great bet is if the twins make the playoffs liriano stays healthy and the playoff draw falls apart in front of the minnesota
1419132 although i guess theyll probably play the al east winner in the first round so that series might actually be harder than the alcs
1419133 blah blah blah lirianos back high five nathan is unstoppable chest bump ron gardenhire is a genius no homo ass grab

1419141 im getting to the bus stop 15 or 20 minutes early and im still having to stand

1419150 i expect the governor to sign this bill into law as has consistently supported our efforts to make sure true freedom of the press is alive and well on our campuses
1419151 allowing a school administration to censor in any way is contrary to the democratic process and the ability of a student newspaper to serve as the watchdog and bring sunshine to the actions of school administrators it is quite disheartening to hear that after we specifically prohibited prior restraint by administrators that some are engaging in this type of nefarious activity and even firing quality teachers because of content in the student newspaper
1419152 in a span of four months they all but stripped me of my professional existence
1419153 since administrators are unable by law to exercise prior restraint with regard to a student publication they lean on advisers to do what they legally cannot
1419154 when advisers refuse they are punished because administrators know they will face no legal consequences sb 1370 is necessary to close this gaping loophole in the law
1419155 the passengers are prepared to remain on board for weeks or longer if their passage is impeded
1419156 gaza is a virtual prison for well over a million palestinians its been under siege almost continuously for two years israel says it no longer occupies the gaza strip so the boat will not be asking permission from israel and will not allow israel to board the boats
1419157 as a doctor there is nothing more sad for me than watching my patients dying
1419158 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1419159 are particularly odious offences in that they constitute a serious attack on

1419172 sewage pipe pours mucky water into streams of dark waste that flow towards the sea

1419174 waterborne outbreaks are to be avoided because of their capacity to result in the simultaneous infection of a high proportion of the community
1419175 restrictions are a clear violation of the universal right to health and a clean environment under international humanitarian law israel as an occupying power is obligated to facilitate access to all essential to life amenities access to clean drinking and sea water are basic human rights
1419176 the idf will probably stop us but part of the point is to show that gaza is closed off
1419177 growing alliance of trade unions community groups faith groups women and youth organisations ngos and other campaigners working together across more than 100 national platforms to end poverty inequality
1419178 abide by international and humanitarian law and un resolutions immediately end its collective punishment policy
1419179 we are living in fear of the devastation of our society
1419180 the blockade makes export impossible so farmers are abandoning their crops israeli incursions result in huge destruction to lands and enterprises almost every industry in gaza is facing ruin this collective punishment must end
1419181 gaza alone without the west bank cannot survive it needs free borders and access 1

1419191 and for more than three hours too the mother was constantly squealing and yelling i could hardly concentrate then darkness approached and i began to rush my shots finally when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment i just packed it all in
1419192 thats right well madam if youre ready ill set up my tripod so we can get to work

1419290 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1419291 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1419292 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1419293 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this

1419338 hopefully there was a feeling that we may have crossed a threshold this afternoon where they were enjoying it and not enduring it
1419339 we are thriving only time will tell and we will see what its like tomorrow when we come out here and get us a couple in there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm in the afternoon you break the group down you break the bodies down if you will and you build them back up and get ready for action maybe it was a significant afternoon well see
1419340 in the national football league man that clock is running you know those are the kind of growing pains that we are going through it is great to get him in there with the first group surrounded by some guys that know what they are doing and get to work i thought from that standpoint it was very good

1419350 this is a specious construct steeped in marxism eighty six percent of all federal income taxes are paid by the top 25 percent of income earners up from 84 percent in 2000 the top 50 percent of income earners pay 97 percent of all income taxes the top 1 percent of income earners pay 39 percent of all income taxes up 2 percent from 2000 when president bush took office data from irs for years 1986 2005 exactly how much more are we expected to pay when president reagan cut the highest personal tax rate from the confiscatory 70 percent rate to 28 percent it resulted in federal tax receipts nearly doubling from 517 billion to 1 032 billion the bush tax cuts resulted in a 187 billion increase in federal tax revenues during the first eight months of fiscal year 2005 a rise of 15 4 percent in federal tax receipts federal tax receipts in the first two years of bushs tax cuts increased 30 percent
1419351 all of that notwithstanding obama purposes to penalize people of all industries from landscapers to administrators for daring to be even moderately successful and by his economic policy advisers own admission it is because we take advantage of tax cuts and deductions available to every working person industrious enough to reap the rewards of their labors its not about people being left out for obama its about american wealth which he views as being in the hands of white capitalists and therefore wrongly obtained his veiled racist and marxist leanings blind him to the reality that as the wall street journal pointed out in 1980 when the top income rate was 70 percent the richest 1 percent paid only 19 percent of all income taxes today they pay 39 percent of all income taxes obama is on record as saying we americans cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to be ok thats not leadership thats not going to happen obamas global tax investors business daily july 29 2008 exactly why cant or more specifically why shouldnt americans enjoy the fruits of our prosperity why should we be penalized or be ashamed that we live in a country where we can keep most of what we earn why should we feel ashamed that foreign governments keep the billions of dollars in foreign aid for themselves while their people go hungry in the streets shouldnt obama be advocating that those governments step up instead of advocating that we give more money are the oil producing countries doing anything to reduce global poverty jihad and solid silver audis dont count why isnt he sending this message to the saudis
1419352 we should have great concern pursuant to obamas position on reparations regardless of his recent claims of being opposed to reparations for blacks that position will change as soon as he gets elected as i have written before we need to give critical attention to obamas relationships prior to his current public incarnation he is not just a stealth socialist he is a stealth reparationist and black liberationist consider obamas relationships with the african world reparations and repatriation truth commission a group demanding 777 trillion in black reparations with frank marshall davis who fled chicago after congress and the fbi began to close in on him for his subversive and un american activities with the maniacal group acorn and with gerald kellman and saul the red alinsky we dont need a black man to be president so badly that it forces us to take leave of our senses we need a man or woman president who is pro america pro her citizens is committed to our constitution and pro traditional values

1419389 we have forgotten so much about the immediate aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks that many people may not remember the deadly anthrax spores that were mailed to various prominent people in politics and in the media during that time none of the intended victims was killed by the anthrax but five other people were including two postal workers who apparently became victims because they handled the mail containing anthrax spores in the instant search for someone to blame biologist steven j hatfill was publicly named as a person of interest in the case by government officials he became in the media presentation the villain du jour the government was eventually forced to issue a retraction and agreed to pay a settlement of more than 5 million but retractions never catch up with the original charges which will blight this mans life the longest day he lives more recently a federal investigation has focused on someone else who worked in the same scientific laboratory as hatfill this time the new suspect was about to be indicted as distinguished from being tried in the media and he committed suicide this may mark the end of the anthrax story but the reckless destruction of peoples reputations and the disrupting and blighting of their lives in the media is continuing on there is much to be said for the british practice of limiting what can be reported in the media about someone on trial until after that trial is over once a charge has been made and publicized from coast to coast if not internationally later exoneration will never get the same publicity so the damage cannot be undone
1419390 the 24 hour news cycle may require that somebody be saying something on the air all the time
1419391 one of the perennial crusades of the media has been to have more government business televised their self interest in this is obvious but the benefits of televising government proceedings if there are any benefits must be weighed against the enormous harm that this can do not only to individuals but to the country television conveys false information as readily as it conveys the truth congressional hearings are not glimpses of truth they are staged events to perpetuate some political spin televising these political shows only impedes congress ability to get serious work done in private instead of spending time playing to the peanut gallery both individuals and the country deserve more protection from publicity abuse than they usually get
1419392 spanking school pupils for deviant behavior has been frowned upon by human rights organizations in every country in some parts of africa though the practice is yet to go away the nigerian government has just reintroduced canning or what is commonly referred to in ghana as lashing in schools the reasons given for this are the high rate of indiscipline in schools and perhaps too much freedom which usually leads to unrest when students make demands nigerias energy minister announced this after cabinet had met and decided that more discipline needed to be instilled in students to reduce the many cases of chaos in schools students often resort to violence in reaction to decisions taken by school authorities the reintroduction of caning in schools might deter radical students from engaging in violent activities or perhaps joining violent militia groups
1419393 even though past performance is no guarantee of future results should this bear market only equal the averages we will need to experience additional declines of from 9 1 to 14 6 from current levels

1419399 do not have to bear the full costs of research and development for the software
1419400 in recent years certain open source software business models have evolved into a growing challenge to our license based software model
1419401 the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsofts own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products
1419402 microsoft released the sharepoint protocol as part of its compliance with the european commissions decision issued on march 24 2004
1419403 the popularization of the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including continuing efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products
1419404 were launching two additional cloud computing centers and one of them is going to be an extremely large cloud computing center the largest that weve launched to date
1419405 both new facilities are examples of how were investing hundreds of millions of dollars to create extremely efficient datacenters based on cloud technologies and our enterprise architecture which weve instantiated in other cloud computing efforts
1419406 from a consumer perspective looking at it from the different use cases that are coming about you see the growth of these huge web 2 0 applications out there as well as the emergence of a huge mobile user base these applications require large amounts of compute resources just to handle the number of users because with the web 2 0 phenomenon people are actually contributing content back to these sites
1419407 its not to say that everybody is going to be exactly like youtube but even with a bank a user consuming your service could be a person standing on the side of the street hitting the refresh button on their stock ticker or account balance or whatever
1419408 thats going to create huge demand on the systems that are running these applications so it isnt just about back end data processing we want to talk about supporting lots of different types of workloads both user based workloads and back end based workloads
1419409 the thing thats really compelling about the cloud model when its used either internally or externally is that there are levels of efficiency that one is able to get that you just cant get with conventional data centers over time even internal datacenters will migrate more and more to a cloud approach where they adopt cloud principles such as virtualization
1419410 the software in these cloud datacenters is composed of a number of our tivoli products including a request driven provisioning product we also use a lot of xen but were able to use other virtualization technologies such as vmware too
1419411 customers arent going to be ripping out datacenters and replacing them with cloud centers overnight this is going to be a gradual process
1419412 its going to be a hybrid model with both internal and external clouds
1419413 create s a new opportunity to shape the relationship between those who use it services and those who sell them
1419414 obviously there are the early adopters who are out there playing with it right now but most of the world is trying to figure out what to do with it what it means what the value to them is going to be
1419415 at share were trying to introduce the technology the options get people into that planning phase get them better able to understand what it is theyre talking about
1419416 the idea of bigger clouds that transcend an individual organizations boundaries and kind of go to this notion of true utility computing is probably still a little further out
1419417 right now were trying to bring the discussion into the share audience start to expose people to what its all about get them prepared for when the cios says i want my own cloud because she read about it in an airline magazine or something like that
1419418 we are excited to announce the continuation of our relationship with the james bond films and unveil james bonds new phone for this year the limited edition version of our c902 cyber shot phone with the rich array of content both on the phone and preloaded on a memory card bundled with the c902 titanium silver limited edition fans of the secret agent will only get more james bond with sony ericsson
1419419 at this point given that we have plenty of money in the bank it makes a lot more sense not to distract ourselves with trying to put the finishing touches on a revenue plan
1419420 unless we have a reliable service that works the way we think it should
1419421 when you think of it that broadly as a utility i think you can begin to imagine how big the potential is for twitter as a commercial entity
1419422 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
1419423 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of
1419424 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
1419425 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
1419426 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
1419427 the quality of the content and the information is paramount
1419428 you want to make sure youre striking the right balance between giving your readers everything the web has to offer with making sure theyre getting the right information and the relevant information
1419429 if it does succeed its going to be done in a way thats subtle enough that its there for people who want it
1419430 but its not going to be intrusive for people who dont

1419470 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1419471 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1419472 documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal
1419473 siddiquis papers included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1419474 may the blood of unintelligible be directly on your unintelligible possibly head or hands
1419475 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1419476 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1419477 we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1419478 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1419479 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay
1419480 its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through

1419485 last week california governor arnold schwarzenegger ordered a pay cut to minimum wage of 6 55 hr for 200 000 state workers because a state budget hadnt been approved yet the state controller who has opposed the pay cut on principle and legal grounds now says the pay cut he says it would take 6 months to go to minimum wage and 9 months more to restore salaries once a budget is passed the system is based on cobol according to the sacramento bee and the state hasnt yet found the funds or resources in 10 years of trying to upgrade it

1419490 hamouda bessaad 34 was found by police officers last night with stab wounds to his upper body in londons old kent road mr bessaad originally from tunisia was pronounced dead at the scene
1419491 hambis killing was too commonplace to cause a fuss i suppose
1419492 just another stabbing in a london street whats that he was a quiet man a private man a fantastic person there are no vigils for him no ones demonstrating in the street no ones protesting at his senseless death
1419493 hambi wouldnt have wanted a lot of attention but id like people to know what a special man he was thats all
1419494 and he looked tired he was house sitting a friends flat in southwark he said he would drop by an internet caf on the old kent road to call his parents in tunisia and then have an early night
1419495 we are all going to miss him terribly and in a flitting footloose business like ours that is about the highest tribute a man can be paid he only saw the good in people hambi was a gentle guy the sort of bloke who would always walk away from trouble he was just a peaceful man
1419496 they said their prayer for the rite of passage together
1419497 hambi was not a practising muslim but he would have taken comfort in that final prayer
1419498 he had these little rituals at home working in the restaurant the way he would place your plate on the table or refill your glass or move a chair out for you to sit down they were very special hambi habits when he was alive you hardly noticed them
1419499 one day you hope you will forget the shock of the moment the policemen knocked on your door to tell you that your husband has died knifed to death in the street and one day please god maybe you will but the pain will never go away i dont want any other family to go through such grief caused by a lack of respect for another human life
1419500 by promoting natural family planning and female education we have curbed population growth to 2 04 percent during our administration down from 2 36 percent in the 1990s when artificial birth control was pushed our campaign spreads awareness of responsible parenthood regarding birth spacing long years pushing contraception made it synonymous to family planning therefore informed choice should mean letting more couples who are mostly catholic know about natural family planning
1419501 if there is discipline in marital bed there is discipline in the streets there is discipline in schools there is discipline in government said the archbishop
1419502 when a filipino husband comes home frustrated tired drunk in bed with his wife she hasnt got a chance to check her calendar if it is a bad day
1419503 the population policy of this government is clearly flawed because of the undue subservience of president gloria to catholic bishops
1419504 basically arguing that resorting to artificial means of family planning as opposed to natural methods is abortion is completely wrong
1419505 we should respect all of them because what were trying to protect is the quality of life of the filipino family and it has to be moderated in terms of numbers
1419506 since you have a growing number of people to take care of shouldnt it be logical and reasonable to include that factor in our national planning
1419507 while the bible tells mankind to multiply it has specific instructions for humanity to care and protect all of the creation the board of the philippines council of evangelical churches pcec said in a statement released on the weekend
1419508 one doesnt have to be an economist to tally how much more food water shelter medicine and other resources will be needed for their support
1419509 the present uncontrolled population growth over these many years has undeniably contributed to and accelerated the poor getting poorer and has led to thousands of abortions unnecessary maternal deaths abandoned children increase of street dwellers
1419510 the problem of population growth is the problem of poverty
1419511 dont blame population growth for poverty the problem is disparities in the income levels
1419512 why not address the issue of how many calories of food are wasted by the rich how much energy is wasted by the rich world
1419513 the vulnerabilities came to light after an unencrypted vip laptop computer was discovered to be missing from san francisco international airport on july 26

1419517 included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1419518 siddiqui was also in possession of numerous chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
1419519 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans

1419525 without an alert commitment for 17 years the bomber force has seen a dramatic atrophy of its nuclear operational and academic skills set
1419526 the elevation of the national guard chief to four stars recognizes the enhanced importance of the guard to americas overall national defense
1419527 in recent years facilitated by general blums strong leadership the national guard has transformed from an often neglected strategic reserve to a force that is an indispensable component of the operational military
1419528 the national guard is an integral part of the defense establishment and this has been a long time coming
1419529 in the pentagon a four star general has an entirely different status than a three star general
1419530 while in a sense they gained in terms of status and influence over resource allocation they will still need to fight in terms of operational issues
1419531 todays national guard is a 21st century force that has been trapped in a 20th century decision structure within the pentagon

1419536 for a first ever presidential transition in an era of terrorism we need to think and act nontraditionally
1419537 the question is will there be trust and confidence in the judgment of career personnel who come rushing in to the white house to say mr president we recommend shutting down the nations air traffic control system
1419538 agrees that the next president will need to expedite the transition process and if elected will take the steps necessary to ensure a safe fast and orderly process
1419539 senator mccain is acutely aware of challenges associated with a wartime transition and he will address these matters in the appropriate way at the appropriate time
1419540 do i agree we have more to do certainly we will be working on this every day
1419541 this certainly requires a closer look than we have so far because these are serious issues
1419542 i want the government to know that i see this as relevant necessary and exculpatory
1419543 i just believe the defendant cannot have a fair trial without this evidence
1419544 the prosecution is charged with protecting the national security of the united states
1419545 the detainees that they want access to hold in their heads some of the most serious national security and intelligence sources and methods that the united states has
1419546 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even nonexistent
1419547 as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
1419548 statements and indications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that iraq and al qaeda had a partnership or that iraq had provided al qaeda with weapons training were not substantiated by the intelligence
1419549 this is stunning the secretary of defense testifying before congress about whether or not ground forces would be strategically necessary in a war against iraq said the executive branch knew something that it did not know
1419550 it is ironic that the democrats would knowingly distort and misrepresent the committees findings and the intelligence in an effort to prove that the administration distorted and mischaracterized the intelligence
1419551 some have suggested that detainee abuses committed by u s personnel at abu ghraib in iraq and at guantanamo were the result of a few bad apples acting on their own it would be a lot easier to accept if that were true
1419552 senior officials in the united states government sought out information on aggressive techniques twisted the law to create the appearance of their legality and authorized their use against detainees
1419553 particularly disturbing part of the story how the techniques used to teach american soldiers to resist abusive interrogations by enemies that refuse to follow the geneva conventions were turned on their head and sanctioned by senior leaders for their use offensively against detainees
1419554 access to ones own feelings and the ability to discriminate among them and draw upon them to guide behaviour

1419578 proposing that aggressive intervention to lower cholesterol levels as early as childhood is the best approach available today to reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease
1419579 with a large body of evidence proving that low cholesterol levels equate with low rates of heart disease
1419580 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1419581 if saturated fats caused even a portion of the damage for which they are frequently blamed their negative effects should be readily and repeatedly demonstrable in controlled clinical trials however after excluding the results of the poorly designed and sloppily conducted northern european studies it quickly becomes apparent that there does not exist a single tightly controlled trial which shows that saturated fat restriction can save even a single life
1419582 lowering low density lipoproteins to less than 50mg dl even in children and young adults is a safe and potentially life saving standard

1419852 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1419853 while there is little question that testing some men in this age group is probably not beneficial due to limited longevity and the potential adverse side effects of treatment a significant percentage of men at age 75 can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 years
1419854 the updated task force recommendations for men ages 50 to 74 are in line with the current recommendations from the american cancer society and other major medical groups our guidelines say men 50 and over with at least a 10 year life expectancy should be offered screening but the choice should be made by patients with their doctors this means men should be given the option to be tested and can make a decision after weighing the pros and cons

1419861 very few people understand the value of writing my purpose here is to help you see why writing is such a blessed asset of the spiritual life to be convinced of the value of writing if only a few words every day is to have made a giant stride on the road to sanctity writing disciplines the mind left to ourselves our thoughts are nothing less than a jungle filled with wild animals our most important duty in life is to master our minds to control our thoughts writing is a proved way of lowering oneself in ones own estimation there is no way known for more surely and effectively growing in humility than by writing what god in his wisdom and love has shared with us keep a record of that share that wisdom and love with others by writing it down

1419863 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1419864 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1419865 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1419866 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1419867 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1419868 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1419869 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1419870 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight

1419875 when i wake up one day say that this is where i want to go then thats when it will happen
1419876 my dad didnt even know i was going to commit that day
1419877 i wanted to get it done that way i could put all my focus onto working on my grades and not stressing over which college am i going to choose basically just take some of the pressure off me
1419878 i love the coaches and i love the atmosphere just the tradition of the campus that goes on i really like the coachs style of play
1419879 but i think in the end i still would have chosen usc
1419880 im glad i decided early but if i wouldnt have known and if there wasnt that other girl that was going for this scholarship i probably would have waited it out
1419881 every coach probably wants you to commit as soon as possible to know that their school is favored so theres pressure but my mothers a very strong woman and she liked to alleviate that pressure
1419882 she said to just wait until you believe that its absolutely the thing you want
1419883 were not going to commit until we see all the schools so that you know this is the best choice for you

1419900 i would describe it as a sign of the deep relationship that president bush has worked very hard along with president putin to establish
1419901 is an opportunity to reach an agreement on missile defense but hey if we dont have it by sochi well keep working on it theres no deadline here
1419902 well have some more work to do afterwards but we think the dialogue is headed in the right direction and that this meeting will be able to push that along even further
1419903 the substance is commendable but why are we signing this document with a lame duck president

1419908 if it does come to a head weve found it is best just to tell them to go to hell and run your state the way you want to run your state
1419909 were certainly going to honor the law but were going to continue this dialogue because the idea here is to make sure states are going through the appropriate steps for safety and security of the identification process
1419910 hopefully that will earn us enough points to move this along with people being able to travel later this year
1419911 we have not completely made up our minds on the route but we would hope the dhs would treat south carolina the same way they have treated montana in this case
1419912 these states are flouting real id and dhs has had to capitulate to that
1419913 im thrilled to be on the dhs team and i am looking forward to doing my best to serve the country
1419914 here you have a group thats allegedly in charge of cyber for dhs and then we see another group being set up outside that in a structurally new way
1419915 we still dont know what beckstroms relationship will be to all of the other bits of cyber bureaucracy lying around

1419919 whether were looking at a fortune 500 company an army or a community our natural reaction is ask whos in charge

1419951 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1419952 fulfill its olympic bid commitments to increase access to information and expand freedom of the press
1419953 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences

1419962 ive been offered by buffalo and akron the past two weeks they are both official offers
1419963 ive also talked to villanova delaware virginia west virginia pittsburgh and temple
1419964 a lot of those schools are saying they like me on both sides of the ball but want to wait the first few games of my senior season to see how i play and then go from there
1419965 ive looked both akron and buffalo up on the internet
1419966 it looks like they have nice facilities ive been trying to touch base with the coaches i havent been able to reach them yet i am planning to visit akron and buffalo in the next few weeks thats my only plan right now
1419967 i also play running back my fastest 40 yard dash time is 4 64 seconds i think i had about 400 yards on offense and maybe 70 tackles on defense last year
1419968 ive been getting mail from pittsburgh boston college illinois maryland wake forest and virginia tech
1419969 right now my favorite is illinois im really cool with the person that recruits this area coach locksley he was the coach when my brother was being recruited and theres somewhat of a bond between us
1419970 id say my top three is illinois boston college and pitt
1419971 they said they want to see film of my first couple of games then they might offer
1419972 they offered him a while ago and he liked what he saw when he was done there for the chris paul camp in june
1419973 the thing i know tony liked about wake forest was the fact that he was always dealing with head coach dino gaudio thats a big thing because hes the guy thats going to be making all of the decisions

1419991 we understand that he will return to canada feyenoord regrets the departure of the player because his football qualities were not part of discussions
1419992 in the next week or so i will have to make one of the biggest decisions of my career
1419993 i am nearing the crossroads where if the injury does not improve i will have to decide whether or not to go ahead with surgery
1419994 the alternative is simply to give my wrist more time to heal and continue with the rehabilitation therapy which i have been doing over the past few weeks
1419995 it is a huge decision because if i go for surgery next week then i certainly would be out for at least two to three months which would take me through to october in effect i would miss the rest of the season
1419996 at this point it doesnt look good for me for the ryder cup
1419997 if i go for surgery then obviously im out but if i choose to continue with the rest and rehabilitation then i might miss the next three or four events and that would probably mean i would not automatically qualify for the team nick faldo to offer me a wildcard place
1419998 it has all been hugely frustrating and missing the british open and the u s pga and possibly missing the ryder cup are all very disappointing
