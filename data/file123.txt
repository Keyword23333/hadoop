1230000 been following his progress on various mountains for about five years and this news is incredibly saddening
1230001 if anything tommy walsh is taller and heavier than kieran donaghy and he can kick a point colm cooper working off them i think they have the formula to retain their title
1230002 put it this way would the kerry full back line themselves hold them i dont think so thats the measure of them
1230003 kerry have always been a team to play to their strengths and right now their strength lies in donaghy and walsh paired together
1230004 as a team wed always be confident of holding cooper in three games against monaghan now i think he has scored just two points from play but donaghy is different and now walsh is effectively doubling the dose
1230005 the best half of football over the weekend was according to all reports the second half of the kerry monaghan game
1230006 i felt that was when we played some of our best football over the three weeks we really took the game to kerry but to their credit they always responded they had a real appetite in them
1230007 we dont know what the salary for this post will be yet but im willing to bet it would be enough to provide the nurses needed to open cork mercy hospitals new a amp e unit which is lying idle and looks like remaining in mothballs for a long time to come
1230008 we are facing a crisis in the public finances thanks to the mismanagement of the current and his ministers vital services are being cut and the health service is getting worse not better
1230009 will lead a team of professionals and proactively promote the positive work being achieved by the hse and hse funded agencies through the national media
1230010 will also work closely with the national director of communications and other members of the national communications unit
1230011 this new system allows us offer court users across the country choice and ease of access in relation to financial dealings with the courts it will make it easier to pay fines and will speed up payments in the family law area
1230012 the system allows immediate access to paying fees in the small claims procedure and also allows us automatically refund bail monies once a case is ended
1230013 sen marzilli groped me and all i got was this lousy t shirt
1230014 a moonbat is someone whos willing to be a little bit of a dreamer
1230015 in many companies and sectors pay arrangements are still covered by the current agreement if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1230016 the collapse of the pay talks further dispels the myth of s supposed competence on the economy the government found it easy to broker a deal between unions and employers when they could pay for it through the proceeds of a debt fuelled boom and explosion in public spending
1230017 now that the government is facing a tougher economic climate its entire economic policy is unravelling with unemployment rising house prices falling business and consumer confidence plummeting and nothing on offer from the government to tackle any of the problems facing the economy
1230018 for the avoidance of doubt about what trade unions were prepared to contemplate in an national agreement we were prepared to accept that it would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid
1230019 saya diberitahu oleh dua orang yang hadir di mesyuarat tersebut bahawa ezam menyatakan akan berlaku terhadap anwar tuduhan yang sama tetapi watak yang berbeza
1230020 jarang dari kita yang memberi fokus sepenuhnya dalam amalan solat yang dikerjakan sebab itulah bermacam kemungkaran dan masalah berlaku meskipun solat dilaksanakan
1230021 setiap rukun dan syarat sebelum dan semasa mengerjakan solat ada sebab dan hikmah yang tersendiri
1230022 kesan terhadap solat yang khusyuk dan memberi fokus sepenuhnya akan memberi impak besar pada fizikal spiritual psikologi dan kesihatan hidup seharian seseorang
1230023 tetapi tidak semua kejayaan dan kebahagiaan yang diraih mampu memberi kegembiraan kepuasan dan ketenangan dalam kehidupan
1230024 di sinilah pentingnya solat dan kekhusyukan ketika beramal bagi membentuk insan yang penyabar berdisiplin terfokus dan sihat yang berjaya dan bahagia
1230025 hai orang orang yang beriman ruku lah kamu sujud lah kamu sembah lah tuhan mu dan perbuatlah kebajikan supaya kamu mendapat kemenangan al hajj 18 dan 77
1230026 jika kamu dalam keadaan takut bahaya maka solat sambil berjalan atau berkenderaan kemudian apabila kamu telah aman maka sebutlah allah solat lah sebagaimana allah telah mengajarkan kepada kamu apa yang belum kamu ketahui al baqarah 238 239

1230060 hey zombie fans we are having so much fun cleaning out zombie headquarters that we put more amazing memorabilia up for grabs click
1230061 i think it has definitely taken the band to the most extremes of its sound i really dont think there is any space for more intensity without changing the sound of the band one thing that i was very aware of was the fact that i didnt wanna change the character of the band its not too hard to get heavier but it s very easy to lose your identity i really wanted to preserve the feel from eight moons i felt there was something individual about it and combined that with the aggressive elements of the empires of the worlds of course all the elements were then evolved to a much heavier new composition for the cannibalised album
1230062 i think the album itself to be honest its such a heavy concept that cannibalised offered that there was no other way than to write the way i did it wasnt easy even though i did enjoy it a lot it took 14 months from start to mastering to put together cannibalised it was hard work but i am very pleased with the reactions it makes all the hard work worthwhile
1230063 regards from chilly buenos aires here is winter while in finland is summer this is no news but it is still very weird when you travel frequently and change the continents that the climate changes dramatically and you need some time to adjust to it i am preparing myself for the south american tour which is going to start pretty soon this tour is something that ive been waiting for so long it is no lie to tell that it is one of my biggest dreams to be able to perform in this continent local people here are very emotional and passionate and they want to show their love for music and the artists soon the rehearsals for the tour will take place in mexico i am looking forward to see how kiko loureiro angra guitarist and the rest of us will get the ball rolling and rocking i am very excited so take your camera with you to the concerts to capture the unique atmosphere and performance of this group of people you never know when this is going to happen again one of the personal highlights of the tour will be definitely the return to guadalajara mexico as some of you might know some nasty bad things happened there to me many years ago while performing on stage because of this specially i wished to get an opportunity to go there again i want to get a nicer memory of the city and its people and to heal my scars in the end i cant blame all the audience for one stupid mans behaviour i miss my fans in mexico and i will be very delighted to sing for you again before the tour still next week i am going to spend it in los angeles there i will meet some familiar people from film music scene that were already working with me earlier and also i am looking forward to meet very interesting and great composers for the first time lets see what kind of songs we are going to create together i am sure it will be a great experience for me to write with them i am continuing doing promotion for the first album even though my thoughts are already in the next one it is good to know that there is still a lot of work to do for my winter storm since the touring keeps on going at the moment i am writing new songs alone here at home a sort of d j vu that reminds me of the beginning of the process of my winter storm the biggest difference is that now songs are flowing constantly and i am very anxious to start the production and recordings once again i have already told you the name of one new song the crying moon not a ballad as most of you wrongly guessed here goes another name of a song we composed in antigua with michelle and kiko enough you wont need to wait too long to listen to it i decided to perform it live in south america

1230093 this case started with concerns from neighborhood activists which led to a diligent fbi investigation that revealed a scheme using phony rehabs and straw borrowers to steal millions of dollars from mortgage lenders but the lenders were not the only victims of these crimes the multiple foreclosed properties had a devastating effect on neighborhoods known for their historic character these criminals will now go to prison and we will continue our work to bring to justice others responsible for mortgage fraud
1230094 during 2008 and 2009 weaker world economic growth is likely to mean lower demand for dairy products

1230136 we wouldnt recommend any of them because we havent seen evidence that any of them deliver what they say but if mr smith down the road said he bolted one to his car and felt he got some benefit were not going to challenge that
1230137 what concerned us in recent times was the increase in cost for some of these devices there are some where its upwards of around 5000 for a conversion that starts to highlight to us there is maybe a requirement to say look just be warned the price is getting quite high without any real proof of them being able to deliver
1230138 and some people are now saying that if you convert to their device then theres some ongoing servicing that needs to be done at the end of the day the costs are starting to creep up and the benefits would have to be very very large

1230202 in logic there is a trace of effort and pain logic is self conscious so is ethics which is the application of logic to the facts of life life is an art and like perfect art it should be self forgetting there ought not to be any trace of effort or painful feeling life ought to be lived as a bird flies through the air or as a fish swims in the water as soon as there are signs of elaboration a man is doomed he is no more a free being you are not living as you ought to live you are suffering under the tyranny of circumstances you are feeling a constract of some sort and you lose your independence not to be bound by rules but to be creating ones own rules

1230219 this is a follow up on our post regarding a problem affecting thousands of wordpress blogs
1230220 we currently have over 95 percent of all the vehicles running which is a tall order under these conditions
1230221 in the old shop we had to rack and stack vehicles
1230222 we worked on two vehicles in the shop and others outside in the hot sun
1230223 we are always working on ball joints brakes and air conditioning units there is a lot of work going on here
1230224 by working shoulder to shoulder and being willing to help any unit in need weve earned some respect
1230225 i want people to have confidence in the work we do
1230226 there is nothing that you can give us that we cant fix
1230227 my biggest fear is that someone will get hurt because i didnt do my job properly
1230228 the mechanics of prt konar are just one of the many vital parts of the team
1230229 when we make contact with the enemy i know our vehicles are up for the fight
1230230 with the start of the open beta test the company has also announced a special new program for players of the game the guaranteed fun promotion
1230231 its in our national interest to help others realize the blessings of a free society so that when we look back at the initial chapters of the 21st century we will say weve done our duty we defended the united states of america and we laid the foundation for peace to come
1230232 their service in afghanistan and iraq and elsewhere is making this nation safer
1230233 and for the family members of those airmen god bless you and thank you for standing with your loved one
1230234 the other day i made it clear that our policy on rotations is now 12 months in 12 months out
1230235 i know the stryker brigade from fort wainwright was one of the first brigades to extend and i understand it puts stress on the families
1230236 because of the progress were making in iraq theres now certainty in the rotations
1230237 well if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime
1230238 i think its important and i know most of you here think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1230239 i know free societies yield the peace we all want
1230240 its in our national interest to keep the pressure on the terrorists to give them no safe haven no place to hide to keep them on the run
1230241 and you have the thanks of our entire nation we honor your service
1230242 there is no finer honor than being the commander in chief of a fine group of men and women and im proud to be in your midst
1230243 these deployments do take a toll on the soldiers and their families
1230244 i think its a little bit tougher on the families back home because their loved ones are deployed to a combat zone
1230245 the uncertainty missing all of those special moments with your family i mean that takes a toll
1230246 the department of defense has gone all out to do the best that we can to maintain good connections between the deployed soldier and the family back home
1230247 just knowing that their loved one is ok is a great thing
1230248 personally ive taken on as a mission that every single soldier will get a ballot
1230249 whether they choose to vote or not thats their call but it will be in their hand and then they will have time to vote and i think they will

1230254 the current market turmoil is without precedent in the postwar period with a significant risk of recession in the us compounded by sharply rising inflation in many countries fears are building that the global economy might be at some kind of tipping point
1230255 these fears are not groundless the magnitude of the problems yet to be faced could be much greater than many now perceive
1230256 it is not impossible that the unwinding of the credit bubble could after a temporary period of higher inflation culminate in a deflation that might be hard to manage all the more so given the high debt levels
1230257 the statistics may understate the contraction in the supply of credit
1230258 they could find it difficult to secure foreign funding if global financing conditions were to tighten more severely
1230259 there is a risk that chinas imports overall could slow down sharply should the us economy weaken further
1230260 inter bank money markets have failed to recover of greatest concern at the moment is that still tighter credit conditions will be imposed on non financial borrowers
1230261 in a number of countries commercial property prices are beginning to soften traditionally bad news for lenders these real financial interactions are potentially both complex and dangerous
1230262 explicit and implicit debts of governments are already so high as to raise doubts about whether all non contractual commitments will be fully honoured
1230263 it cannot be denied that the originate to distribute model cdos clos etc has had calamitous side effects loans of increasingly poor quality have been made and then sold to the gullible and the greedy
1230264 how could such a huge shadow banking system emerge without provoking clear statements of official concern
1230265 the fundamental cause of todays emerging problems was excessive and imprudent credit growth over a long period policy interest rates in the advanced industrial countries have been unusually low
1230266 policymakers interpreted the quiescence in inflation to mean that there was no good reason to raise rates when growth accelerated and no impediment to lowering them when growth faltered
1230267 we need policy measures to lean against credit drive excess
1230268 should governments feel it necessary to take direct actions to alleviate debt burdens it is crucial that they understand one thing beforehand
1230269 to deny this through the use of gimmicks and palliatives will only make things worse in the end
1230270 for the first time ive seen iraqi security forces that can plan prepare and execute first class offensive operations
1230271 ive also seen a high level of trust and respect by the people of rashid for their own army and police forces
1230272 together we conduct relentless offensive operations designed to kill capture or drive from rashid anyone who threatens the safety and security of the people we have sworn to protect
1230273 i believe this reduction in violence is a direct result of the conditions set by the success of the surge in forces and combat power
1230274 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
1230275 emplaced by special group criminal who operate as part of the illegal militias in baghdad
1230276 i think they want to undermine the government and theyre using the neighborhoods of rashid as a battlefield
1230277 there seemed to be a wedge that was placed between the people and the insurgents and we tried to exploit that
1230278 it is my firm belief that the decisive defeat of the special group criminal and militias in may and june of this year has opened a window of opportunity for us to make substantial and lasting improvements in the rashid district
1230279 we have captured more than 170 special group criminal associated with the jaysh al mahdi militia
1230280 seizing on the improved security conditions we are pursuing reconstruction projects to improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1230281 weve also proposed an additional 117 projects valued at more than 26 million
1230282 each project is coordinated with the rashid district council leadership to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the people
1230283 slight and thin and not very tall her body c arrying her spirit with as little fuss as possible
1230284 she was the first woman to lecture in theology at oxford college the first woman to lecture anglican clergy and one of the first women to be included in church of england commissions these accomplishments along with her wo rk as a retreat leader made evelyn underhill a prominent figure in her day
1230285 by the 1030s evelyn had become the first women in the twentieth ce ntury england to be taken seriously as a theologian a stunning feat in an era when women were forbidden to even teach theology
1230286 an only child whose upper class parents often left her at home alone while they went yachting she took to plotinus at an early age perhaps finding in his idea of the flight of the alone to the alone a solution to her own loneliness and an impetus to study the mystics
1230287 it is the art of establishing his conscious relati on to the absolute
1230288 taken all together they c onstitute phases in a single process of growth involving the movement of consciousness from lower to higher levels of reality the steady remaking of character in accordance with the independent spiritual world
1230289 dietrich bonhoeffer tried to follow one side of barth his seperation of christianity from culture and religion to its radical conclusion bonhoeffer participated in church opposition to hitler but remained in g ermany the nazis arrested him for playing a minor part in a plot on hitlers life but he continued to write theology in letters from his prison cell
1230290 cheap grace therefore amounts to a denial of the living word of god in fact a denial of the incarnation of the word of god
1230291 cheap grace is preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance baptism without church discipline communion without confessions absolution without personal confession
1230292 costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again the gift which must be asked for the door at which a man must knock such grace is costly because it calls us to follow and it is grace because it calls us to follow jesus christ
1230293 he is called out and has to forsake his old life in order that he may exist in the strictest sense of the word the old life is left behind and completely surrendered the disciple is dragged out of his relative security into a life of absolute insecurity that is in truth into the absolute security and safety of the fellowship of jesus
1230294 to deny oneself is to be aware only of christ and no more of self to see only him who goes before and no more the road which is too hard for us
1230295 if we refuse to take up our cross and submit to suffering and rejection at the hands of men we forfeit our fellowship with christ and have ceased to follow him
1230296 discipleship means allegiance to the suffering christ and it is therefore not at all surprising that christians should be called to suffer
1230297 only he who believes if obedient and only he who is obedient believes

1230302 hai kaumku sembahlah allah sekali kali tiada tuhan selain dia dan jaganlah kamu kurangi takaran dan timbangan sesungguhnya aku melihat kamu dalam keadaan yang baik mampu dan sesungguhnya aku khawatir terhadapmu akan azab hari yang membinasakan kiamat
1230303 hai kaumku cukupkanlah takaran dan timbangan dengan adil dan janganlah kamu merugikan manusia terhadap hak hak mereka dan janganlah kamu berbuat kejahatan di muka bumi dengan membuat kerusakan
1230304 hai syuaib apakah sembahyangmu menyuruh kamu agar meninggalkan apa yang disembah oleh bapak bapak kami atau melarang kami berbuat apa yang kami kehendaki tentang harta kami sesungguhnya kamu adalah seorang yang sangat penyantun lagi berakal
1230305 hai kaumku bagaimana pikiranmu jika aku mempunyai bukti yang nyata dari tuhanku dan dianugerahi nya aku daripada nya rezeki yang baik patutkah aku menyalahi perintah nya
1230306 hai syuaib kami tidak banyak mengerti tentang apa yang kamu katakana itu dan sesungguhnya kami benar benar melihat kamu seorang yang benar benar lemah diantara kami kalau tidaklah karena keluargamu tentulah kami telah merajam kamu sedang kamupun bukanlah seorang yang berwibawa disisi kami
1230307 hai kaumku apakah keluargaku lebih terhormat menurut pandanganmu daripada allah sedangkan allah kamu jadikan sesuatu yang terbuang dibelakangmu sesungguhnya pengetahuan tuhanku meliputi apa yang kamu kerjakan
1230308 hai kaumku berbuatalah menurut kemampuanmu sesungguhya akupun berbuat pula kelak kamu akan mengetahui siapa yang akan ditimpa azab yang menghinakannya dan siapa yang berdusta dan tunggulah azab tuhanku sesungguhnya akupun menungu bersama kamu

1230315 at 8am veronica gomes her guide to the poor areas and i went out
1230316 we went to taltala bazaar and there was a very poor woman dying i think of starvation more than tb what poverty what actual suffering i gave something that will help her to sleep but the woman is longing to have some care i wonder how long she will last her temperature was just 96 degrees 35 56c she asked a few times for confession and holy communion i felt my own poverty there too for i had nothing to give that poor woman i did everything i could but if i had been able to give her a hot cup of milk her cold body would have got some life i must try and be somewhere close to the people where i could easily get at the things
1230317 i believe some are saying what use of working among these lowest of the low that the great the learned and the rich are ready to come it is better to give full force to them yes let them all do it the kingdom must be preached to all if the hindu and muslim rich people can have the full service and devotion of so many nuns and priests surely the poorest of the poor and the lowest of the low can have the love and the devotion of us few the slum sister they call me and i am glad to be just that for his love and glory
1230318 i am well compared to the devil and the work as his work and so on someday all will be clear i love loreto just as much if not more now as i did for so many years i pray for them often and their persecution makes me love my new vocation more
1230319 i want to say to you something but i do not know how to express it
1230320 there is so much contradiction in my soul such deep longing for god so deep that it is painful a suffering continual and yet not wanted by god repulsed empty no faith no love no zeal souls hold no attraction heaven means nothing to me it looks like an empty place yet this torturing longing for god pray for me please that i keep smiling at him in spite of everything i am perfectly happy to be nobody even to god
1230321 the conditions under which the leper families live are terrible i would like to give them better homes uplift them close to the sacred heart make them know that they too are the loved children of god and so give them something to live for i want slowly to build a little town of their own where our lepers could live normal lives if you only knew what goes on within my heart sometimes the pain is so great that i feel as if everything will break the smile is a big cloak which covers a multitude of pains
1230322 lord my god who am i that you should forsake me
1230323 i have no faith i dare not utter the words and thoughts that crowd in my heart and make me suffer untold agony so many unanswered questions live within me i am afraid to uncover them because of the blasphemy if there be god please forgive me trust that all will end in heaven with jesus when i try to raise my thoughts to heaven there is such convicting emptiness that those very thoughts return like sharp knives and hurt my very soul love the word it brings nothing i am told god loves me yet the reality of darkness and coldness and emptiness is so great that nothing touches my soul before the work started there was so much union love faith trust prayer sacrifice did i make the mistake in surrendering blindly to the call of the sacred heart the work is not a doubt because i am convinced that it is his not mine not a single simple thought or temptation enters my heart to claim anything in the work it is the cloak by which i cover the emptiness and misery
1230324 i want only god in my life the work is really and solely his he directs every movement i take puts the words in my mouth makes me teach the sisters the way all that and everything in me is he this is why when the world praises me it really does not touch my soul
1230325 before i could spend hours before our lord loving him talking to him now not even meditation goes properly
1230326 very often i long to make use of the food i give my sisters but i can never do it
1230327 when the work started with my whole heart i accepted everything my sisters father are the gift of god to me they are sacred to me each one of them i love them more than i love myself
1230328 my heart and soul and body belong only to god that he has thrown away as unwanted the child of his love and to this father i have made that resolution in this retreat to be at his disposal let him do with me whatever he wants as he wants for as long as he wants if my darkness is light to some soul even if it be nothing to nobody i am perfectly happy to be gods flower of the field
1230329 the other day i cant tell you how bad i felt there was a moment when i nearly refused to accept deliberately i took the rosary and very slowly without even meditating or thinking i said it slowly and calmly the moment passed but the darkness is so dark the pain so painful but i accept whatever he gives and i give whatever he takes people say they are drawn closer to god seeing my strong faith is this not deceiving people every time i have wanted to tell the truth i have no faith the words just do not come my mouth remains closed yet i still keep on smiling at god and all
1230330 some time ago a group of professors came from the us and said tell us something that will help us and i said smile at each other i must have said it in a very serious way so one asked are you married and i said yes and i sometimes find it very difficult to smile at jesus because he can be very demanding
1230331 rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten
1230332 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
1230333 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
1230334 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
1230335 you will get your english based historians who come out of an english culture who dont understand it and avoid it because they dont understand it
1230336 if you dont understand it youre risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it
1230337 if you dont understand the things you are talking about you take one hell of a risk
1230338 very very hard for a pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they dont know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language
1230339 he has that kind of response when he comes to the plate
1230340 when the people fear their government there is tyranny when the government fears the people there is liberty
1230341 we do things as soon as we can if there is a problem and thats why
1230342 devin thomas i dont think hell be ready this week
1230343 he was just getting to the stage where he could start running last week and for him i just think he needs another week
1230344 i dont know if it is a high ankle or a low ankle but nothing with major injuries just bumps and bruises were really excited about that
1230345 the quarterbacks were trying to throw on rhythm the receivers were trying to get to their spots with efficiency running hard and i thought the efforts were good we had a couple of very fortunate catches or i should say risky throws and very fortunate catches
1230346 had a couple of plays where they could have gone either way
1230347 those are things that he can learn from he has to become a more disciplined quarterback not risk as much as he risked in the game it turned out to be great for us a great performance but it could have easily been the other way
1230348 if i didnt know some of the things it was how to work with the officials pregame
1230349 all the discussions all the things we have to write down all the things i have to sign off on to make sure were following the league rules those are new because ive never done em before but it wasnt difficult
1230350 three months later i surprised them and i made the team
1230351 for me to do this i had to believe in myself that it could happen before it ever did and i think thats why it did happen
1230352 now the important thing is not to be satisfied with just making the team
1230353 there has always been something inside me that i dont want to tread the path that somebody else already has
1230354 i want to make a statement for myself and a name for myself making this team is a great way to start
1230355 this is probably some of the best training ive done in quite some time
1230356 i felt the best i have in the water training wise and ive definitely done some of my best times in the water while ive been training here
1230357 some of this confusion is understandable given issues get complex quickly when you start peeling off the layers however much of it comes from the very same opportunistic hardware amp software vendors who somehow convinced us years ago that clusters had become grids these same people are now trying to convince us that grids have become clouds in order to sell us their version of a private cloud which is apparently any large intelligent and or reliable cluster
1230358 what the general public thinks about the teacher of the year
1230359 is always pained to have to extend tours he understands the effect that has on the families of our forces but he also appreciates our commanders need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in afghanistan
1230360 i have enough weapons around me that if i do that well be all right
1230361 i think its pretty tight all the way around 1a 1b 1a 2a whatever you want to do with it
1230362 id like to make a decision on that pretty early one of the things were trying to do differently than what ive done in the past is make our decisions on first and second teams earlier maybe a week earlier and really try to prepare for the season
1230363 i wouldnt say i have a leg up but i definitely have a little bit of an edge just because im going in number one
1230364 i have a lot of experience were neck and neck at this point well see what happens
1230365 so you think the fannie may bailout was a good thing isnt this a conservative website
1230366 the disadvantages of an elite education our best universities have forgotten that the reason they exist is to make minds not careers
1230367 not the kind of college that had an education department
1230368 there was a bit of a sense of collecting experiences or achievements at times among my world traveler grant getting friends experience definitely trumped strict academic achievement but i think beneath that lay a very real desire to know the world which meant taking risks of many kinds including intellectual
1230369 i desperately need to get into a top tier college because otherwise ill be a failure
1230370 i didnt believe that my particular body of knowledge was worth anything more than that of my students it has taken me years to begin to figure out which aspects of my education are worth passing on to students
1230371 what makes you think im not equally passionate about school efficiency and saving public monies
1230372 get into trouble and tumble into a cycle of school failure
1230373 however it does change the source of that self esteem from an external appearance based approval seeking basis in coed classrooms to a more internal performance and talent based basis in all girls classrooms
1230374 i refuse to do all that junk you do for nothing
1230375 you work so hard doing authentic learning stuff but my scores are always better and im not as tired
1230376 the kids are so engaged they love working together dont you remember the fill in the blank project they worked on they were into it and so were the parents
1230377 gospod e si ti mi reci naj grem k tebi po vodi
1230378 child centered classrooms and self esteem grading and what he construes as tech induced deterioration of traditional skills such as spelling reading books and memorization of facts
1230379 immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy my mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and id spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose thats rarely the case anymore now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages i get fidgety lose the thread begin looking for something else to do i feel as if im always dragging my wayward brain back to the text
1230380 an act of thanksgiving to god the father first of all and second to our own parents because if they had not been motivated to have large families none of these tenth born children would be here
1230381 share be patient tolerate frustration and postpone gratification which psychologists say are much needed values in todays society to value each human life as a precious gift of god the father to learn that one can get by with a little because what is important and necessary is not what the world tells you is essential but rather the presence of those at your side
1230382 the world rejects large families and sometimes they are attacked as if they were crazy but those who decide to have a large family have eyes fixed on the most high one believing that the existence of a new member of the family and giving the other children a brother or a sister is more valuable than the material things they could otherwise have
1230383 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity

1230431 one small step for man one giant leap for mankind
1230432 the main reason i am going is because i want to grow as a player and experience playing rugby in different conditions and circumstances and it is also an opportunity for me to further my studies in business and finance
1230433 the approach came from eddie early this year and i liked the plans he has in store for the club
1230434 there is nothing negative about my leaving the sharks and going to england it is a case of a good opportunity arising and feeling that it is the right thing for me at this time i would still love to play for the springboks one day
1230435 well then i would have to make a choice but any talk of me playing for england is way premature that is not something i am thinking about right now
1230436 personally i think it is a joke that players of such high quality are not in the national squad
1230437 we are talking about world class players so south african rugby must be exceptionally strong if they are not required
1230438 in the end we can never be given knowledge by others we can only be stimulated we must develop our own knowledge
1230439 we could get 3 to 5 inches of rain but the ground is dry and i dont think that will be a major issue
1230440 were preparing for a category 2 though we believe it wont be that severe
1230441 most boat owners are moving loose debris putting out extra bumpers doubling lines checking batteries and topping off freshwater in case something happens with the water lines here
1230442 until all the danger is past and then well start bringing it back up
1230443 obviously were ready to make adjustments if the weather changes but at this point we dont see any impact on our production
1230444 theres always a gray area about what caused what first
1230445 if its a category 4 storm theres usually no one around to see it
1230446 i think in this area they understand a little better than other areas
1230447 have a list of pet friendly hotels veterinary clinics and boarding facilities in or around the town your are evacuating to
1230448 a lot of animals that died during rita were cases of overheating because of power outages not because of the storm

1230453 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1230454 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1230455 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1230456 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1230457 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat
1230458 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1230459 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1230460 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1230461 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1230462 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad

1230466 you could call 911 and this place would be full of firefighters in just nothing flat
1230467 but i know he was a great guy that hes done a lot for this department
1230468 maybe one day during construction youd go by and lay half a dozen blocks or 10
1230469 and the next day maybe you wouldnt get there but we finally got it
1230470 we put a little rope at the entrance so no one would touch it
1230471 i was 6 years old when they got the fire truck and i remember seeing it coming up the street
1230472 i decided right then i was gonna be a fireman
1230473 i can remember when i was a kid i used to hide in that truck when they had a fire and pop up
1230474 charlie would get about halfway there and it would be too late to take me back
1230475 i see a fire truck or hear a siren and i get a little pit in my stomach
1230476 thats a feeling youll go to your grave with there aint nothing like running into a burning building
1230477 the doc told me dont even go by the firehouse
1230478 so i dont know i just sort of lost interest

1230483 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1230484 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1230485 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1230489 you have to hope the senate doesnt take it up
1230490 at least we as people who are accountable to our constituents can go back home and talk about what we did on the issue
1230491 we try to put them under as much pressure as we possibly can
1230492 until monday the worst thing happened for the 49ers all three looked overwhelmed by the raiders defense in very different ways smith was throwing too late osullivan too early and hill too often to the wrong team
1230493 im not into the whole you know when the lights go on i play well

1230497 we cant hold off indefinitely hes going to have to be arraigned in the near future and then the case will take its course
1230498 i have seen some pretty difficult and very tragic situations in 30 years of criminal defense practice
1230499 the sadness here is as bad as it gets for mr harrison and his family and friends this is a good man who has the unwavering support of his entire family they are all dealing with their grief in this most difficult of times

1230502 someone who looks hard at the text and history of the constitution as justice scalia does and articulates a very clear idea of how that text points to liberal and progressive outcomes
1230503 it is a court with no true liberal on it the most conservative court in 75 years
1230504 what we call liberals on this court are moderates or moderate liberals if you want to get refined about it
1230505 the justice as a teacher in a national seminar an educator
1230506 theyre not just making laws and delivering those tablets from mount olympus

1230509 perth will soon boast some of the best sporting facilities in the world and the 2018 commonwealth games would allow us to maximise their potential
1230510 designed primarily for football the new 60 000 seat multi function sports stadium to be built at kitchener park could easily accommodate track and field events as well as host the opening and closing ceremonies
1230511 we are also building the 14 000 seat perth arena indoor stadium on wellington street and a new state athletics centre and eight court basketball stadium at ak reserve in floreat
1230512 these state of the art facilities along with a range of existing world class venues mean perth would be well placed to host most mandatory and discretionary sports likely to feature in the commonwealth games
1230513 dhoni has been declared the recipient of the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award the countrys most prestigious sports award
1230514 he has represented the country with distinction and deserves the honour
1230515 his exemplary leadership and demeanour under pressure especially in the icc world twenty20 and the tri series in australia mark him out as the ideal role model for millions of young indians who want to make a mark in life
1230516 i think if we get everyone back i think we are still a pretty competitive team
1230517 even against the bulldogs on the weekend we went down by 16 points
1230518 i also dont like this car i dont like how its dark in here with a top i dont like the windows

1230521 this racket has been thriving with the connivance of the bank staff who were clearly found to be involved in clandestine replacement of notes with fake currency

1230524 there is an urgent need to amend the law as in other western countries abortion is allowed even a day before the delivery in special circumstances like when the couple knows that the child may be born with severe disability
1230525 there are special circumstances provided under law when a woman can go in for an abortion like when a doctor says that having a child would prove a risk to the life of the woman cause her grave mental or physical injury or that the child may be born with severe disabilities
1230526 its the need of the hour that we should legalise abortion as otherwise this will invite illegal means which is more dangerous for our society
1230527 their choice as they are the only ones who will have to look after the child after it is born
1230528 it is irrational and unfortunate that a couple who has sought legal help from the judiciary didnt get justice we cannot push a mother to have an abnormal child as it is her responsibility to take care of the child at the end of the day
1230529 if there is a medical opinion with regard to the abortion of the foetus then even the judiciary should rely upon it and give its nod for abortion as then it will not be illegal
1230530 once someone sees mr heller walk in that door with his gun and start the registration process then walk back out with his gun it may be a different story
1230531 he wore his heart on his sleeve when it came to issues of social and economic justice
1230532 he was a tireless and effective advocate for the environment the mentally and physically disabled and for abused and neglected children
1230533 he spearheaded efforts for funding natural resources and human service programs during his almost three decades of public service his role was critical in galvanizing the regional efforts to clean up the chesapeake bay
1230534 working with ian mcgeechan and shaun edwards and all of the coaching staff at wasps has been a fantastic experience for me
1230535 when ian spoke to me about the captaincy my first thought went to lawrence dallaglio
1230536 he is a great leader and an absolute legend of this game nobody will ever replace him and for me it has been a great honour to play both alongside him at wasps and against him in the international arena
1230537 raf has been an immense captain for france throughout his international career and one of the great players among the wasps squad throughout the last three seasons
1230538 the decision to appoint him as club captain was an easy one what raf has achieved his character and the way he operates is first class and there is no more deserving a man for the job
1230539 if he manages to achieve real independence for the courts it would not be reform it would be a revolution
1230540 i understand that if need be i can appeal directly to the president of our country however respecting the law and the judicial branch as one of the constitutional pillars of society and the state i deem it necessary first to use the judicial procedure to exercise all rights

1230546 tomorrow tuesday afternoon i will be presented at real madrid this will be the start of a new chapter in my life i will do everything to help the team and the club to win trophies
1230547 most people off the field would not have any idea of what he had to go through
1230548 the pain the icing and the pain killers to get himself through to play on the last day in september and be a part of our first premiership is something that he will never forget and something that well always cherish
1230549 his resilience to come back from adversity be it injury or any other thing off the field that hes had to deal with has been outstanding
1230550 hes a wonderful example to the rest our players and hes been a brilliant leader in the vice captaincy role over the last few years
1230551 i tried to train once in two weeks and when i couldnt really walk i knew what was coming
1230552 it was just a matter of confirming it with the medical staff
1230553 obviously you play for the friendship from team mates the roar of the crowd and things like that

1230570 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
1230571 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
1230572 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
1230573 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
1230574 we warned folk to only deal with authorized ticket suppliers
1230575 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
1230576 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
1230577 when we said we werent going to raise more capital we said we were adequately capitalised at that point in time
1230578 and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless and to be manipulated by those intent on selfprotection or self promotion

1230591 people expect that after they have worked all their lives and paid into the system their disability benefits will be there when they apply
1230592 instead they find that they may be expected to go back to a job they held 15 years ago or take a job that they have never done before
1230593 a period where the people of that time share the same history and experiences that shape their values and outlook on life
1230594 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way
1230595 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
1230596 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
1230597 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore
1230598 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential
1230599 when we added a website and shopping cart system our numbers went through the roof
1230600 this teamed with high positioning in the major search engines really created a whole new market for us that was never expected
1230601 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
1230602 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the online casino sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
1230603 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our online casino sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are

1230641 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world
1230642 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people

1230650 there is place for both open source and proprietary in any sme environment its really about the right tools for the job
1230651 for example in a desktop environment in which users just need a simple web interface basic word processing and a spreadsheet an open source package such as ubuntu running openoffice would be perfect these users dont need the bells and whistles of a microsoft office
1230652 absolutely the way to go open source allows for rapid change customisation and greater flexibility
1230653 sme versions of heavyweight proprietary solutions generally offer fewer features than their big brother counterparts which is why they are more affordable for the sme but what if the particular whistle that has been left out is one the sme needs and what if there are still features in the lite version that the sme can easily do without
1230654 with an open source option smes can have a solution that not only fits their precise needs it will be easy to scale as the business grows

1230661 while the vast majority of respondents said board certification is important to them most didnt understand the meaning of board certification
1230662 sixty percent incorrectly believe that a doctor has to be board certified to practice medicine and only 45 percent of survey respondents had ever checked to see if their doctor is board certified board certification is actually a voluntary process a doctor undertakes to demonstrate a commitment to lifelong learning and proficiency in his or her medical specialty
1230663 communication skills are increasingly recognized as an essential component of quality healthcare and not something thats nice but not necessary

1230783 for so long sleep problems have not been perceived as medical problems so people havent sought medical attention for them
1230784 sleep is tied up with everything else in our lives and is tightly bound with our well being
1230785 its becoming its own field and its being recognized by more doctors and patients alike
1230786 many of the patients that we see are just burning the candle at both ends
1230787 lifestyle choices are the most common cause of sleep problems
1230788 the obvious solution to most sleep problems is to simplify your life and get more sleep but thats not the easiest thing to do

1230797 it became quickly obvious that the problem was human behavior
1230798 to change human behavior we needed to educate humans about the consequences of their behavior and then where necessary regulate that behavior
1230799 virginia is one of the best places to see the broad winged hawks

1230803 a big problem with the conservation movement is that a lot of the things that kids are taught arent accessible to them we need to preserve the rain forest and we need to worry about big things like global warming but there are a lot of smaller scale things that are equally as important and can lead to bigger lifestyle changes
1230804 if that area gets developed they dont have that stopping point
1230805 and theyll have to go farther without stopping which they may or may not be able to do
1230806 obviously were not going to stop global warming or climate change by reducing litter but what we are going to do is give children a way in which they can make a difference that is proportionate to their capacity as their capacity increases so too will the difference they can make

1230826 for a man who will turn 72 this month hes a surprisingly immature politician
1230827 is it fair to judge john mccain s alleged racism sexism and homophobia against the social norms of the 1980 s in the use of jokes and statements made to a small circle of friends
1230828 id like to do the same guess that makes me a dyke
1230829 three reporters from arizona on the condition of anonymity also let me in on another incident involving mccains intemperateness
1230830 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt
1230831 this is the man the republican party thinks should be the next president of the united states what else should we expect from a party that promotes racism homophobia and discrimination against anyone with a different skin color sexual orientation or ethnic origin
1230832 so we shouldnt be surprised that mccains campaign strategy seeks to raise racial fear about barack obama the first african american with a serious shot at the presidency of the united states
1230833 a retired naval officer who says he served with mccain in the navy says he treated black sailors with disrespect and scorn mccain refuses to release his detailed military record and some sources say that record includes incidents that include issues with black sailors
1230834 as noted by a black poster in talking points memo
1230835 i cant love america the same way john mccain does when his daddy was admiral my daddy was mopping floors and when his granddaddy was admiral all the blacks in the entire navy were mopping floors but they still volunteered and went to war even when their commanders didnt think they were brave enough to fight so who loves america more the cook on the ship who couldnt vote in 15 states or the admiral who dined on the meals he slaved over
1230836 mccains collection of off color jokes are riddled with racist words and sentiments advisors have toned down the raunchy rhetoric of his early years in congress but close aides say his attitudes have not changed
1230837 mccain opposed making the birthday of slain civil rights leader martin luther king a national holiday
1230838 it is offensive because by using a racial epithet that has historically been used to demean all asians to describe his captors mccain failed to make a distinction between his torturers and an entire racial group
1230839 it is alarming because a major candidate for president publicly used a racial epithet refused to apologize for doing so and remains a legitimate contender
1230840 for his 2000 campaign for president mccain hired richard quinn founder and editor in chief of southern heritage magazine to serve as his spokesman in south carolina
1230841 whose role in history was to lead his people into a perpetual dependence on the welfare state a terrible bondage of body and soul
1230842 what better way to reject politics as usual than to elect a maverick like david duke
1230843 what else do you expect from a racist bigot and homophobe
1230844 new york daily news has a new twist in the administration s attempt to peg the anthrax attacks to its own bellicose aims

1230846 by some chance of history we have trodden the same path seventy or eighty years before the west

1230855 dangerously mislead contemporary scholars and hinder them from understanding the essential socialistic nature of what has happened in the
1230856 a great deal of material that in the has either been consigned to mandatory burning or to eternal concealment from human eyes
1230857 thats my favorite part of the song keurvorst said in our interview
1230858 that song is so angst ridden im not thinking he might have f up im thinking this is a hard song for him to sing god knows ive been in that situation a song i wrote about my boyfriend leaving me and they are all staring at me and this is gonna be hard having to sing this song angst ridden we are music geeks the attention to detail is very important and thats the thing that takes us to the next level
1230859 how well are the presidential campaigns doing with viral video
1230860 exemplified the sheer coolness factor of underground japanese technology and culture with regards to teenagers use of
1230861 the mobile phone creates its own user culture which in turn produces new urban culture and new ways of life
1230862 im turning japanese i think im turning japanese i really think so
1230863 users would be willing to pay for a digital song at an online music store when they can download songs for free via these networks
1230864 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
1230865 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1230866 me encuentro trabajando en mi puesto y hasta ahora no he tenido noticias desde buenos aires
1230867 estoy esperando que me llegue la notificaci n sobre mi renuncia
1230868 tengo una responsabilidad que cumplir hasta que me tenga que ir
1230869 haciendo una buena gesti n m s all de todas las cuestiones pol ticas
1230870 two pianos an organ and a steeple with a bell that really works in it
1230871 estar amos muy contentos de que fuera garc a porque es un hombre excelente hemos trabajado mucho y formamos parte de los mismos equipos t cnicos en esta gesti n pero antes tambi n trabaj con l
1230872 eso depende de los manejos pol ticos desde buenos aires en conjunto con las provincias productoras la corporaci n lo nico que hace es sentar en el directorio al presidente del inv
1230873 para la corporaci n han pasado tres presidentes y nuestras estrategias se mantienen constantes ahora discutimos si seguimos manteniendo la misma t ctica o la modificamos seg n los escenarios cambiantes pero en lo posible pretendemos estabilidad en todas las instituciones
1230874 el xito y el inter s que despert en el p blico brasile o hace que volvamos esta vez en octubre con m s propuestas y m s empresas
1230875 hasta el momento confirmaron su participaci n las bodegas couvelier de los andes finca sophenia familia zuccardi norton bodegas trivento fabre montmayou valle escondido augusto pulenta y achaval ferrer entre otras
1230876 participamos en el mes de julio y ahora volveremos con m s productos nosotros exportamos principalmente a brasil a los estados de san pablo y de r o de janeiro y esperamos seguir expandiendo el negocio ya que es un destino donde hay mucho potencial si bien brasil se caracteriza por tener consumidores de cerveza en los ltimos a os y con el crecimiento del poder adquisitivo fruto de los cambios producidos en ese pa s est n entendiendo que el vino conlleva otra cultura y de a poco se est n abriendo
1230877 brasil es un mercado prioritario en materia de comercio exterior porque es una especie de prolongaci n del argentino ya que hay una proximidad geogr fica y cultural
1230878 son m s simples las acciones de log stica la distribuci n y hasta el idioma lo que a la hora de vender ayuda mucho
1230879 no hay grandes inconvenientes debido a que hay que recordar que estados como san pablo y r o de janeiro cuentan con un sector de la poblaci n de clases sociales media y alta
1230880 ha logrado una participaci n en el mercado de entre el 15 y el 28
1230881 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
1230882 good news in my kingdom even the spiritually bankrupt get invites
1230883 who always took it for granted that christian rock stinks
1230884 despite its literally confessional lyrics this is a bright catchy indie pop song
1230885 im surrounded by bigots and fools who say your love is a heavenly paycheck and faith is all about rules
1230886 your newspaper is both a joy and a powerful engine for good
1230887 agradezco el apoyo de las entidades del campo hemos trabajado estos seis meses en contacto permanente y escuchando a todos los sectores tratando de buscar consenso creo que esto debe continuar
1230888 la decisi n de quien vaya a ese lugar la tiene que tomar la presidenta
1230889 seguramente como es tradici n ese cargo va a ser ocupado por un mendocino
1230890 hizo las cosas bien no me preocupa ese tipo de cambios lo que quiero es que el instituto siga trabajando bien
1230891 si viene otro que sea tan bueno como jaliff ni siquiera me puse a pensar en la ida de l porque hasta ahora se desempe muy bien
1230892 no creo que sea bueno que en este tipo de instituciones haya un pol tico al frente en vez de que haya un funcionario de carrera que conozca en profundidad el asunto vitivin cola
1230893 es un mal presagio que vayan sacando gente pero creo que mientras m s castiguen a cobos m s fuerte lo van a hacer
1230894 nosotros vamos a exigir que el pr ximo titular del inv se mantenga dentro de los par metros t cnicos
1230895 si nosotros como sector hemos demostrado que somos ordenados y nos hemos puesto de acuerdo sobre el camino que necesita la industria en el futuro lo nico que pedimos es estabilidad en el cargo del titular del inv
1230896 el vicepresidente le ha dejado a cristina una serie de temas que causan preocupaci n y que necesitan ser abordados de manera inmediata desde la inflaci n pasando por la ley de coparticipaci n federal de impuestos siguiendo por los servicios p blicos en general y la generaci n de energ a en particular etc tera
1230897 sport and recreation minister ngconde balfour has called a one day indaba to thrash out the problems plaguing professional boxing in south africa
1230898 the global south has come to its place of maturity i dont know how the two structures will work together in the future those who adapt the quickest will be the ones who win the day
1230899 if there is no moratorium then the communion will split he said
1230900 pay careful attention to the words must should and do for an indication of how strong the moratorium will be
1230901 we are extremely pleased with the data emerging from our proprietary 5 ht6 antagonist program
1230902 suvn 502 a potent selective brain penetrant and orally active 5 ht6 receptor antagonist for the symptomatic treatment of alzheimers disease
1230903 the 5 ht6 receptor antagonist suvn 502 enhances acetylcholine and glutamate in rat ventral hippocampus and frontal cortex a microdialysis study
1230904 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
1230905 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
1230906 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
1230907 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunologic approach to exploit this window of opportunity
1230908 the good news was the surprisingly nice t cell response patients had to the flu vaccination even relatively soon after completing chemotherapy
1230909 that shows that the general idea of using immunotherapy following chemotherapy to prevent recurrence is not a flawed one chemotherapy depleted the immune system but we could restore it
1230910 was not very immunogenic we have a long way to go to optimizing this vaccine
1230911 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism
1230912 this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
1230913 if this peptide can be developed into a treatment for children with this common form of hi we may have a new tool for controlling their insulin levels and managing their disease
1230914 these data strongly support the further development of lx214 as a topical product for serious ocular inflammatory conditions as well as for dry eye syndrome
1230915 we believe that the product has best in class potential based on the preclinical findings
1230916 the study demonstrates that our tight junction technology effectively delivers pyy into the body via nasal administration but that the peptide itself is not effective as a single agent for weight loss
1230917 we are pleased that once again our delivery technology has effectively and safely delivered a large molecule via the intranasal route with good tolerability but disappointed that pyy did not show more promising therapeutic effect we believe our intranasal delivery technology continues to demonstrate value as a means of safely administering peptides and proteins and believe that pyy might still prove effective in combination with other weight loss drugs we would like to thank the investigators staff and patients who participated in the trial
1230918 this research provides a better characterization of the variables at the cellular circuit and behavioral level that contribute to the persistent nature of addictive disorders
1230919 the researchers were able to illuminate why drug related memories are so stable
1230920 their persistence is highly refractory to new learning which makes our jobs that much tougher and reminds us that treatment must recognize and address the high propensity for relapse almost anywhere down the road
1230921 these results indicate that the ltp induced by self administered cocaine is more persistent than that produced by natural rewards such as food and that the ltp is not just a result of exposure to cocaine but also is linked to the drugs effects and the animals learning to obtain the drug
1230922 these are important distinctions that will help us better understand how addiction develops and why drugs can overshadow other natural rewards and become the mainstay of an addicted persons life
1230923 the study shows that eprotirome can be given safely with statins and has significant therapeutic efficacy on ldl cholesterol triglycerides and lipoprotein a over and above the effect of statin the unique clinical efficacy tolerability and safety make this combination a potentially attractive therapy for patients who cannot achieve their treatment goals with statin alone karo bio will proceed with its communicated strategy with the aim to develop eprotirome through phase iii with a partner
1230924 we are pleased to report continued progress in the development of sirna approaches to gene down regulation as well as an extensive lipid based delivery platform the dila2 platform
1230925 the results of this pre clinical work suggest that a unique combination of both a novel sirna construct within a lipid based delivery formulation has the potential to elicit a potent rnai response and reduce off target activity we believe that a drug discovery platform that has multiple approaches to activating the rnai process as well as a broad delivery capability able to target multiple tissue systems is necessary to successfully develop rnai based therapeutics across all human diseases
1230926 just as the berlin wall once fell when the east germans came together and demanded their freedom we too will give those living in closed societies the technology to take down the great firewall that separates them from the rest of the world
1230927 more and more people in closed societies are becoming aware of the power of our technologies and the power of information as more and more of them are empowered by information freedom no firewall no berlin wall and no iron curtain will be able to hold them back its simply a matter of time
1230928 last year yahoos board of directors and management took steps to thoroughly reexamine the companys direction and to improve the companys performance
1230929 since then yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
1230930 we are at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance
1230931 we are redoubling our commitment to driving sustained profitable growth for our stockholders
1230932 but why live without them when i dont have to
1230933 this bat is finally going to put kelley in the position we have been seeking to be the hands down leader in bat technology and thats not even taking into account our new bat service level agreement a first ever for our industry just to give you an idea we will offer replacements if your bat is not performing at its peak in addition each bat will come with a one time free trade in option during your season i believe we are about to have a big impact on how bats are sold and serviced
1230934 there truly is nothing else like it in the market
1230935 we are going to change the way consumers not only view baseball and softball products but also the way they buy
1230936 i will block your pathetic attempt to strike me down
1230937 and i just bought these really nice cortosis gauntlets too
1230938 wait what you cant deflect a lightsaber you block it
1230939 i will block your pathetic attempt to strike me down
1230940 and i just bought these really nice cortosis gauntlets too
1230941 wait what you cant deflect a lightsaber you block it
1230942 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
1230943 this is really the story of an idea which refused to die and ultimately found a home and sponsor outside traditional television
1230944 these data strongly support the further development of lx214 as a topical product for serious ocular inflammatory conditions as well as for dry eye syndrome
1230945 we believe that the product has best in class potential based on the preclinical findings
1230946 one of these days youre gonna look for me and ill be gone
1230947 contestants is almost on par with the life span of the common housefly second season winner
1230948 surprisingly jason castros getting some critical lovin not surprising winner david cooks one trick pony dated 90s rock act has earned some knocks
1230949 jason is adult contemporary gold or a master minimalist or his set is the eclectic and and entertaining
1230950 i always got jason i am a cheerleader hoping some major label wakes up and see the gold mine that is jason castro his original songs are moving and very creatively crafted he is a story teller for this generation and oh so easy on the eyes quite the thing of beauty inside and out
1230951 i wanted to say that i am a microsoft person and you can talk with me
1230952 i became a christian and all i got was this lousy t shirt
1230953 i have come that they may have life and have it to the full
1230954 it is a precept of my christian faith that my redemption comes through christ but i am also a big believer in the golden rule which i think is an essential pillar not only of my faith but of my values and my ideals and my experience here on earth ive said this before and i know this raises questions in the minds of some evangelicals i do not believe that my mother who never formally embraced christianity as far as i know i do not believe she went to hell
1230955 may not be perfectly consistent with the beliefs of other christians
1230956 if justification is by grace alone we cant possibly know who is saved and who is not more importantly if justification is by grace through faith god has already taken care of the problem of salvation its not one we need to worry about either our own salvation or others our call is not to decide who is saved and who is not but to communicate the gospel far and wide and to work for the health and well being of our communities
1230957 eternal lake of fire where the worm turns and the fire is never quenced with wailing and gnashing of teeth mwa ha ha
1230958 if grace is true why god will save every person
1230959 but when shes not on the beach she loves to get out on the links and play some golf
1230960 gives them increasing breadth so if the antivirus stuff goes south theyll have a space in virtualization which appears to be the next big thing
1230961 as a user i dont have to know or care where the applications are coming from i just want to compute
1230962 applications should follow users instead of being tied to the desktops or user devices
1230963 where im connecting how secure i am what function im trying to perform these should all be governed by policies
1230964 should be able to take any computing building blocks and use them without having to use a vendor specific toolset for the most critical pieces which are application delivery and information management
1230965 got rid of its pc division in anticipation of this
1230966 theres likely to be a huge position in this direction and symantecs positioning itself to take advantage of it
1230967 when you have someone so young with so much promise and so much life taken from yout is unspeakably devastating
1230968 this is such a tragedy for our family akira was so full of life
1230969 but we take comfort in the knowledge that she is with the lord
1230970 rest but only after the dishes are done the laundry is folded the pool is cleaned the children have been to their doctors appts dinner is made children are dressed and safely tucked away on the school bus and all parent teacher meetings have been completed
1230971 this was an awesome experience and i will definitely preach without a manuscript but with some simple notes for my next few sermons the personal connection that i felt and that others reported feeling and the more natural delivery style seem to help me in the task of conveying the gospel conveying the gospel isnt that the point of this whole preaching enterprise in the first place
1230972 how to teach people to be on the lookout for god in the biblical story and on the loose in the world
1230973 so what are you hearing what are you thinking or wondering if jesus was standing here what would you want to say to him what would you want to ask him
1230974 1 teach people to be on the lookout for god in the biblical story and on the loose in the world 2 teach them how to tell their stories with purpose and passion 3 be a safe space when we gather to share our stories with each other so that we learn how to share them with our neighbors
1230975 i am going to stop preaching now and let you preach and share with each other
1230976 theres something wrong with the eeg and i need you to call the doctor

1230983 its great to see some innovative new plastics being released
1230984 another ideal method for their use has been to hook them on a 2 0 hook paternoster style rig in the same way as surf poppers in place of a second bait when targeting salmon and tailor etc
1230985 i definitely have the salad fork the rest of the silverware is a little confusing

1230990 in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin
1230991 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need
1230992 if theres are rescues that will take a pet we will work to find a way

1230994 a lot of times small dogs dont do well in the shelter environment
1230995 they didnt ask to be brought into this world or to be abused
1230996 they are always friendly forgiving i think we owe them something
1230997 if we dont think about how were going to charge these vehicles
1230998 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1230999 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1231000 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1231001 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1231002 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1231003 this case will more than likely be a mental status case
1231004 you have to take the jury inside the persons mind
1231005 for every expert the defense can put on the prosecution can find an expert to contradict that testimony
1231006 hes articulate but hes obviously sick under the law though thats just not enough
1231007 people were so enraged when he was declared not guilty by reason of insanity when he seemed so normal on the outside the standard became much more difficult
1231008 in my experience it is difficult if not unheard of in the state of tennessee to have a jury find a defendant not guilty by reason of insanity
1231009 you have to show the defendant didnt appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct
1231010 what will the victims want as justice and will the state listen to what they want
1231011 you have to show the defendant didnt appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct
1231012 im in a bad mood i dont want to be in a good mood no signing hymns
1231013 i go to church and i love to hear hymns
1231014 if you dont fix this youre not going to be here
1231015 i was kind of surprised to be honest with you
1231016 and im very thankful for the opportunity and coach holmgren and his staff and the people in the front office for believing in me after going through what i went through last year
1231017 hey its a tough business sometimes if he couldnt handle that little bit with me it gets a lot harder than that
1231018 id been a school teacher for a long time now and so i kind of know how its going to work before i do something at least i think i do i try not to back a player into a corner unless i think im going to get the response i need
1231019 just getting a feel for my surroundings and endurance was the biggest deal being able to last for a while
1231020 really the only thing that prevents him from being very very successful on every play is leonard
1231021 hes strong enough hes fast enough he has great skill he has become a very good blocker
1231022 last year we had zero injuries and thatll be tough to do again this year but we hope to do that with all your help
1231023 we cant do anything until all the moms and dads are sure their children are safe inside
1231024 we can throw rocks at them and theyre not going to leave until they feel safe about their child
1231025 if you find out at 10 oclock at night that a kid is going to take a gun to school call us and well intercept the kids either before they get on the bus or get to school
1231026 caritens competitors are 10 to 100 times larger than we are
1231027 there are boundaries on our growth in that we cant offer all the products that a provider like humana can offer
1231028 we always were evaluating our position in the health insurance market
1231029 we think theres a whole other level to be reached
1231030 we can do an excellent job with companies that hire employees in this region
1231031 can offer full solutions to companies with operations nationwide we couldnt sell to
1231032 weve thought that the clinical staff here does some excellent programs
1231033 in the near term itll be a business as usual environment
1231034 we will thoroughly evaluate the situation before we make any rapid decisions
1231035 as rising petrol prices continue to put pressure on all motorists lpg offers an affordable solution that is already widely available

1231037 mahh nothing like an icy cold shower after a long night
1231038 hey rika why are you still up i would of imagined that tonight has been tiring with the graduation and all
1231039 five years five awful yet wonderful years but why would you remember something like that baka yocchan why did you remember something so small something so small from two years ago from that stupid mecha mecha bakajo test
1231040 so many years and here i am still running to you crying why
1231041 how can you always be so strong why can you always cheer me up when i am at my lowest why do you treat me so well when i dont deserve it
1231042 im sorry rika i always wanted to protect you from the tears of sadness i am sorry that i have cause you more pain that i have prevented just know that no matter what i will always lo
1231043 when did this rika must of slipped it in my hand earlier
1231044 i think hes got just a little too much on his mind when he goes to the plate
1231045 theyre pitching him a little differently than they did last year which is what they do at this level he just needs to make his adjustments and he will
1231046 part of doing too much thinking is that youre not ready to hit he listens to everybody and hes very respectful but sometimes you need to manage that a little bit
1231047 if ellsbury is leading off and doing what he was doing he makes our lineup better
1231048 i just think it got to a point where we wanted to take some pressure off and i do think ultimately hell be back there leading off when he does well be a better lineup were just not there now
1231049 he hits the ball as hard as anybody and as far as anybody on our team but theres something being lost from bp to the game thats whats going on sometimes as a coach youre looking for a mechanical flaw and he really doesnt have one
1231050 i want to believe in abductions and ive heard too many stories from too many credible people to be a total sceptic
1231051 the meetings are so important for people whove been abducted
1231052 because of the stigma you cant always talk to friends and family
1231053 we have many high profile members who fear ridicule and losing their jobs if their story gets out
1231054 when someone has just realised what is going on its terrifying
1231055 by opening up about the experience to like minded people you can deal with the stress and hopefully confront what has happened
1231056 typically ill wake up around 3am sensing a presence in my bedroom
1231057 sometimes there is a ball of light sometimes a small being who walks towards me with its hand outstretched its fingers come up to my forehead which leave me paralysed then i pass out
1231058 then i go into a black tunnel with a light at the end unfortunately its not angels waiting for me at the other side
1231059 when i come to im strapped to a metallic slab the beings do all sorts of tests which i dont want to go into suffice to say its not pleasant
1231060 some group members report positive interactions with aliens but mine dont fall into that category
1231061 i can tell the difference between dreams and reality and this is real ive woken up with marks on my wrists and ankles from where ive been restrained
1231062 ive got a scar on my right arm where something might have been implanted by the aliens sometimes you are aware of flying over the top of buildings through the air towards the craft
1231063 on one occasion i spotted a ball in a gutter of the house the next day i went up to check and it was really there
1231064 when i was 18 i thought i was going mad and would end up in psychiatric care
1231065 thankfully now ive come to terms with it and i can offer counselling to other abductees
1231066 i am kept on call by one health authority which i cant mention to talk to anyone claiming an abduction experience consequences of alien contact are many some develop ocd
1231067 i cant go to sleep without the window and curtain open and a light or candle burning
1231068 i often get up at 3am to check the house is okay
1231069 of course abduction puts relationships under strain in the large majority of cases couples split if one doesnt believe the other about what is happening
1231070 admitting youre an abductee really does open a can of worms and can have great implications
1231071 some people think aliens are us coming back from the future to warn about what were doing to the planet
1231072 they dont have sexual organs so perhaps theyve lost the capability to reproduce normally
1231073 if they are cloning they could be dying out as the process cannot continue successfully forever
1231074 whatever the reason they are visiting us and we are powerless to stop them
1231075 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1231076 no man i just discovered laugh a lot dot com
1231077 t o the extent that a surtax on the corporate income of crude oil producers on their upstream operations could approximate such a pure corporate profits tax this would not raise crude oil prices and would not increase petroleum imports in the short run while the current corporate income tax is not a pure corporate profits tax a surtax for oil companies would arguably be an administratively simple and economically effective way to capture estimated oil windfalls in the short run
1231078 the crude oil windfall profits tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy

1231114 illegal cross border waste transportation is a very sensitive topic even with the best efforts and checking procedures its impossible to prevent it from happening
1231115 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
1231116 i got a call and they said we have this great story do you want to do nightshift i came in and we started talking about it
1231117 everyone got nervous because he comes back with a health issue
1231118 i dont look at it that way its one more problem he has to go through in life
1231119 he comes back with the same attitude that hasnt changed
1231120 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
1231121 we are here in our thousands to say hands off our president hands off
1231122 the discourse surrounding zumas trial has shifted rapidly from menacing rhetoric to an all out declaration of war by former soldiers
1231123 this is effectively a promise of a military coup if the courts find against zuma
1231124 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
1231125 we originally expected fuel prices to go down more rapidly the situation on the markets has turned around slightly and we are now waiting to see what developments will come
1231126 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
1231127 the main theme is we may see a shift in focus from this as an area for scientific technology development to one where we are still going to pursue that in certain locations but there are opportunities for more mixed use types of things that could include technology development but also office commercial and residential
1231128 it could be laid out like a village center with restaurants offices above retail then gravitating out to include even some housing
1231129 i think in concept its a pretty good idea but it means you have to have the money to be able to do that
1231130 thats something that i am glad to use to rebut anyone who says this has been a hindrance to development
1231131 im proud to announce that doe is delivering with alternative financing methods that reduce the need for federal spending
1231132 undertake the next level of study of the feasibility of this potential toll project
1231133 to not proceed with the technical work required for the next level of analysis of tolling the parkway we simply will not further consider tolling as a funding mechanism for this project nor for a possible extension of the parkway on to i 40 east
1231134 as the tpo is aware both the general assembly and tdot have been very clear that any tolling project recommended as one of the initial pilot projects must have a strong level of public support
1231135 the preponderance of comments in the local press have also indicated opposition to tolling as a funding option for the parkway
1231136 support for the tolling option during the tpo workshop was modest at best
1231137 comments at the public meeting were far more opposed to tolling than supportive
1231138 committed to recommending pilot tolling projects where there is a strong level of public support to date other than the vote taken by the tpo executive board such support has not been expressed in knoxville or throughout the region
1231139 could and did use his official position and his office on behalf of veco
1231140 we hope to get most of the signatures in that one day
1231141 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1231142 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1231143 i would like to let everybody know that i apologize for my actions
1231144 i apologize to st marys and i apologize to my teammates and to bulldog fans i made a bad decision my teammates were hurt and i just overreacted
1231145 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1231146 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1231147 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1231148 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1231149 a disgrace to the general assembly and the republican party
1231150 would leave our republican caucus meetings and immediately take our republican caucus agenda to the democratic leadership
1231151 the state of being bound emotionally or intellectually to a course of action

1231153 you know im a regular person just like everybody else i go out and do groceries just like everybody when im home i cook dinner
1231154 whoever recognises the truth of the saying property makes free whoever affirms the necessity for a sustaining stratum in any satisfactory social order must look forward to the new order which will aim at the de proletarianisation of the people and at our liberation from the social and economic monopolies under whose harrow no sort of freedom is possible
1231155 i have castigated and repudiated the liberal illusion of human equality i nevertheless ardently champion the doctrine that equality of opportunity is essential
1231156 hitherto the main object of schooling has been to impart information but henceforward it will be regarded as at least equally important to train character
1231157 the child will be growing up into the german cultural world without having his mind unduly diverted towards alien cultures during the receptive years of childhood
1231158 the idea is divine in origin while men are only its vehicles the body in which the word is made flesh the leader is made to serve the idea and it is to the idea alone that we owe absolute allegiance the leader is human and it is human to err
1231159 the idea is the decisive thing and the individual conscience should be called upon to decide if there is any divergence between the idea and the leader
1231160 the man who is unaware of his own limitations inevitably crashes and drags everything else down with him
1231161 hate must be born of love one must be capable of loving to know what is hateful and so have the strength to destroy it
1231162 the german people wants a german revolution that is to say a national and social revolution
1231163 simplifying life would not mean a relapse into barbarism for culture is not dependent upon luxury or upon the gratification of needlessly created wants
1231164 marxism is a socialism both liberal and alien a doctrine whose liberal factors necessarily unfit it for the upbuilding of the socialist future
1231165 thanks to marx engels kautsky etc all typical liberals both by origin and by nature socialism took the liberal path towards alienism as was plainly shown by its relation to the international its class war tactics and its materialist philosophy
1231166 it is assuredly time to end the tyranny of technique to overthrow the dominion of the machine and to make technique and the machine once more servants instead of masters for their dominion has been an unmitigated curse
1231167 those who understand that life in our huge tentacular towns is a danger to the race cannot fail to regard systematic de urbanisation as urgently required for the sake of the people
1231168 owing to the rapid growth of towns of enormous towns tentacular towns people have been uprooted from the countryside and intellectualised in a way that has weakened their healthy instincts this has been accompanied by a growing inclination to overrate both machinery and sport these in their turn tending to hasten the general despiritualisation of life
1231169 a genuine commonwealth of the people can only be established by the destruction of the existing party system
1231170 from their very nature political parties have a vital interest in sundering the people into factions
1231171 the alternative to the bankrupt alien solutions of communism and capitalism the idea which we represent is the political representation of parties trades and professions based on our ancient guild system
1231172 the philosophy of the liberal epoch has been and still is materialism nothing typifies marxism more plainly than the fact that it is tainted with alien views of socialism that its program is shaped by the materialist philosophy which it shares with liberalism
1231173 to the liberal capitalist and liberal marxian ideal of modern mammoth factories producing vast quantities of goods we should contrapose the ideal of a full and free life so that it will be the task of a responsible government to create the economic and social conditions essential to the realisation of such an ideal
1231174 from the right we shall take nationalism which has so disastrously allied itself with capitalism and from the left we shall take socialism which has made such an unhappy union with internationalism thus we shall form the national socialism which will be the motive force of a new germany and new europe
1231175 we are socialists and not mere social reformers and we do not hesitate to say it although the marxians have so painful distorted the meaning of the former term
1231176 the capitalist economic system with it exploitation of those who are economically weak with its robbery of the workers labour power with its unethical way of appraising human beings by the number of things and the amount of money the possess instead of by their internal values and their achievements must be replaced by a new and just economic system in a won by german socialism
1231177 the most deplorable legacy of the capitalist economic system is that it has taught us to judge all things by the standards of money ownership possession
1231178 everything which is detrimental to the existing order of things has our support because we want catastrophe in a word we are pursuing a policy of catastrophe because only catastrophe that is the collapse of the liberal system will clear the way for those new tasks which we national socialists name everything which hastens the beginning of catastrophe in the present system thus for example every strike every governmental crisis every erosion of state power every weakening of the system is good very good for us and it will always and constantly be our endeavour to strengthen such difficulties in order to expedite the death of this system
1231179 the capitalist system with its exploitation of those who are economically weak with its robbery of the workers labour power with its unethical way of appraising human beings by the number of things and the amount of money he possesses instead of by their internal value and their achievements must be replaced by a new and just economic system in a word by german socialism
1231180 strangle the social revolution for the sake of legality and your new collaboration with the bourgeois parties of the right
1231181 the capitalists have worked their way to the top through their capacity and on the basis of this selection which again only proves their right race they have a right to lead
1231182 who influenced your present view of how love is supposed to work
1231183 my parents were a huge influence theyve been together for over twenty years they have five kids they instilled in me a devastating sense of loyalty which isnt really serving me well i cant leave my job move out or let go of a relationship that isnt working im still with my first boyfriend
1231184 however my boyfriend is a different story he grew up in a totally different household his mother got pregnant with him at seventeen she was married to her second husband with another baby on the way by twenty now shes on her third marriage and its on the rocks his dad divorced his second wife hes terrified of commitments like marriage and children but he knows the devastation when one partner cheats so hed never do that its an interesting dynamic he can never commit and i can never let him go
1231185 i think most people whether they realize it or accept it their greatest influence is their mom and dad before we can even speak and commumicate were exposed to their influences on the deepest level we can develop ourselves inner understandings about love that can last a lifetime but most of the deepest feelings we learn about love we learn while were still too young to understand the why or hows
1231186 unfortunately all my influences have been pretty negative im cynical as a result of these experiences but i am trying to work on that
1231187 none of the above like most men my age i grew up with no adult mentors to teach me about dating and relating and it shows
1231188 i bought a computer about five years ago and soon discovered david deangelo and the rest of the
1231189 this is a great question all these people saying that no one influenced their perceptions of love are lying
1231190 we are all influenced by what we see or dont see
1231191 more importantly my lack of a substantial father figure in my life has taught me that i can love myself and should not feel that i must be completed by a partner in order to be whole
1231192 im among the new minority in that my parents are still married they set a pretty good example they can go out alone and the other doesnt worry they can be apart for days without wondering why he she hasnt called they work hard pay their taxes and give themselves vacations theres no red hot passionate mad makeout sessions but theres no screaming and hitting and jealousy either
1231193 the adults of other species have had more important influence than any particular human they seem at times to be more realistic about pair bonding its necessary length to insure the health and prosperity of offspring and its ending they seem far more accepting of life than humans who feel the need to make rules and laws to control the process and give the semblance of safety and control over life against loss
1231194 you are looking for a name for what is a complex series of experiences that has occured throughout life i cannot give you a one person name my parents were incredibly dysfunctional my siblings were merely there growing up we werent close i had no boyfriends until college because i wasnt allowed to date
1231195 also my paternal great grandmother grandfathers side and grandmother fathers mother were my confidants growing up the treated me as one would an apprentice listening radically accepting non judgemental but affectionate no no one
1231196 well it certainly wasnt my own parents they dont even sleep in the same bed anymore so ive seen so many failed marriages and my mom says she isnt attracted to my dad anymore and doesnt love him anymore
1231197 so ive vowed to my self that i wouldnt let that happen in my relationship as you can see im only 20 so i really dont know all about love but i know i want to stick it out until the very end
1231198 it was by far my dad my mom was sickly most of my life and i saw the love and compassion patience and sense of humor and a whole lot of other great characteristics in my dad
1231199 no matter how mean my mom got with him he would either shut up and let her spout off or talked to her firmly while never raising his voice he was a real trooper to put up with the life we had
1231200 thats what really sucks for me my father showed me how men f k around and dont give a rats ass about their kids
1231201 my mom raised the five of us without help including not drinking drugs dumping us off with anyone not even dating she worked like a horse this is why i have a not so good opinion of a lot of men but not all
1231202 i mean when a guy shows signs that hes anything like my father it brings up those old feelings opinions i guess im sure men have the same feelings for shitty moms like my father
1231203 my parents fought alot my gramma gave up on men said they were all worthless she lived out her life alone but happy my parents stayed together until gramma died yet they made it in to a chore
1231204 my sister is the only one who has been married forever and is still happy i have always looked up to her despite what i learned from my parents
1231205 my boyfriend now ex makes me understand the truth behind every relationship
1231206 i was a bit ignorant and thought love is like a fairy tale maybe love can be the answer to everything but no its not like that though love is blind love is also a sense of reality
1231207 you have to keep up with your partner have similar goals and keep lighting a spark i know not all relationships are like that but mine at least in some ways makes me want to be a better person
1231208 so while my view of love has been less romantic recently i gain much more precision into life and in general
1231209 i truely think we are talking about something intrinsic here on some level a connection to nature taught to me by my great grandmother and grandmother that carried over into a desire to feel connection with others

1231220 its been happening since we got it people see it walk over and strike up a conversation with officers then they start talking about other things

1231222 it will respond to calls and we will make a stop with it if we need to
1231223 we have a great department in that they are very committed to the community
1231224 this will help them get out and closer to the community

1231262 democracy appears when some large number of previously excluded ordinary persons what the eighteenth century called the many secure the power not simply to select their governors but to oversee the institutions of government as officeholders and as citizens free to assemble and criticize those in office democracy is never a gift bestowed by benevolent farseeing rulers who seek to reinforce their own legitimacy it must always be fought for by political coalitions that cut across distinctions of wealth power and interest it succeeds and survives only when it is rooted in the lives and expectations of its citizens and continually reinvigorated in each generation democratic successes are never irreversible

1231298 like his academic peers turner used no visual images to illustrate either the talks he gave or the academic articles he wrote instead he relied on an almost painterly prose that evoked similar scenes of migration primitive beginnings and ultimate progress americans already thought in terms of great achievements from primitive beginnings americans already thought of themselves as egalitarian and democratic they had already symbolized such beliefs in imgaes of log cabins and migration into a land of opportunity and had tunred those images into icons turner used the icons

1231301 at the other end of the spectrum are community colleges the two year institutions that are intended to be feeders for four year colleges in nearly every one are tales of academic success against tremendous odds a battered wife or a combat veteran or a laid off worker on the way to a better life but over all community colleges tend to be places where dreams are put on hold most people who enroll say they plan to get a four year degree eventually few actually do full time jobs commutes and children or parents who need care often get in the way one recent national survey found that about 75 of students enrolling in community colleges said they hoped to transfer to a four year institution but only 17 percent of those who had entered in the made the switch within five years according to a separate study the rest were out working or still studying toward the two year degree

1231314 all i know is i wouldnt tan this colour theyre all a little bit too dark and orange for me
1231315 its important to find something that is great for your skin colour
1231316 most people who are very fair do very well with it its more like a blank canvas but other people have to be careful
1231317 even though youre getting a glow to your skin with it it is not protecting your skin
1231318 so you do need to use some sort of sun block with it
1231319 already i had learned from thee that because a thing is eloquently expressed it should not be taken to be as necessarily true nor because it is uttered with stammering lips should it be supposed false nor again is it necessarily true because rudely uttered nor untrue because the language is brilliant wisdom and folly both are like meats that are wholesome and unwholesome and courtly or simple words are like town made or rustic vessels both kinds of food may be served in either kind of dish
1231320 yes when a drop of blood is placed on the strip and the client is hiv positive you can see a colour change
1231321 false positive results can be expected with any test kit

1231325 a 20 per cent rise next year might be achievable and there is certainly talk of a smaller one the year after
1231326 we dont subscribe to the theory that it is suddenly going to fall to the depths which some of the analysts do
1231327 why we dont subscribe to that theory is that all of the infrastructure is full at the moment so any new projects have roughly the same amount of capital intensity it doesnt matter if its us or bhp or rio
1231328 i think were also seeing projects are harder to develop than people think
1231329 were not convinced that all the projects out there will ramp up as quickly as has been talked about
1231330 there has been quite a push to move away from it
1231331 from what ive seen the steel makers and iron ore producers are relatively comfortable with it
1231332 we might move into a pricing separation based on some very high grade iron ore and some lower grade
1231333 weve seen that already with lump going up 95 per cent and fines only went up by 85 per cent
1231334 lump is getting harder to find and is a premium product
1231335 is a huge monster who devours everything and will suffer nothing to live in peace in his neighborhood
1231336 who knows how far these may extend some of our principal rivers such as the appear to have powerfully felt the consequence of that cause already nor are our swamps all cleared yet fully one half of them remain in their primeval state
1231337 the beavers are the philosophers of the animals the gentlest the most humble the most harmless yet brutal man kills them i was once the witness to the destruction of one of their associated confederacies i saw many of them shed tears and i wept also nor am i ashamed to confess it
1231338 our baseball betting research division has been able to harness the power of data mining and databasing to better understand to best way forward
1231339 and as a result finding key baseball betting market trends can be easily made through simple algorithms
1231340 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important baseball betting human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
1231341 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
1231342 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time baseball betting shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
1231343 weve been working on this baseball betting project for 8 months now
1231344 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
1231345 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
1231346 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
1231347 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future financial benefits aside we believe that the baseball betting research process is valuable and can greatly benefit corporate entities and private firms equally
1231348 the most thorough manner to approach baseball betting is through a methodical analysis of trends upward and downward movement and of course changes in the consumer aread
1231349 ive been working in the baseball betting field for years now and just expanded my operations to the internet sales have doubled in no time
1231350 if the deal is good enough the money will show up

1231353 as the number of products available on the market increases and there is a greater use of products there is a higher probability of reaction
1231354 patients dont really know the difference and tend to feel it is all just sensitive skin
1231355 spf 30 gives approximately 97 percent protection while spf 45 gives approximately 98 percent so the one percent makes on a practical level little difference
1231356 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild said phil flynn analyst at alaron trading
1231357 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed
1231358 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1231359 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy
1231360 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce
1231361 its really not surprising considering the lead we got from overseas markets mr lewis said
1231362 all the base metals were hammered overnight with copper nickel and aluminium all down between 3 and 4 per cent

1231367 i wanted her to be impressed when she got back
1231368 we did it on the floor of my vintage clothing shop over a bottle of whisky three hours later
1231369 the immediate health risk could be an infection and the second risk would be to traumatizing the skin
1231370 also if youre using an infected needle youre looking at the risk of hepatitis and hiv
1231371 it takes one treatment to put this on its going to take multiple treatments to remove it
1231372 i like the idea of having an idea having your friend being able to execute it for you and i cant really regret those sort of things
1231373 well do them from sunrise to sunset when people have had a few drinks and its the weekend

1231375 people maybe dont understand cross contamination they might not be careful and they might pass something on to a bud
1231376 with no guidelines out of someones house you dont really know what each individual is going to do

1231380 tanning will only conceal the appearance of cellulite in the short term
1231381 over the long term ultraviolet radiation will weaken and thin the skin exacerbating the look of cellulite
1231382 for fair skinned people tanning can improve the appearance of cellulite
1231383 it is an inexpensive method that anyone can use to improve the surface layer of skin
1231384 exercise can help the physical appearance of cellulite in that it will decrease fat volume and prevent its further deposition
1231385 but it has a mild effect on the appearance of cellulite
1231386 the biggest myth is that people who are really thin dont have cellulite
1231387 ive seen women in my practice who are in top physical form and they still have cellulite
1231388 cellulite does not distinguish between thin or overweight people its more a function of how fat is distributed throughout the body
1231389 topical vitamin a acid derivatives such as retinol tretinoin adapaline and tazarotene have been shown to have a beneficial effect on the appearance of cellulite
1231390 these creams work by increasing the collagen content thereby firming the skin
1231391 often those who are conducting the research have a vested interest in the product
1231392 there is a need for more objective data with sustained results
1231393 much of what causes cellulite is not within our control there is a definite genetic component involved
1231394 the materials were excellent i would definitely recommend it to other attorneys im already using some of the tactics i learned particularly focusing on two or three people at networking events the two and fifteen minute rules and the big rock little rock concept my expectations of the teleseminar were more than met

1231398 in any case the sale of the banking business seems quite unlikely
1231399 we think that suncorps management likes to picture suncorp as a bank with insurance operations rather than an insurer with banking operations
1231400 such mentality is in our view unlikely to change under the current leadership
1231401 so whilst this is all a handy fall back position that must mitigate some of the risks evident in the economic and company specific backdrop it seems unlikely to eventuate

1231434 its an important asset for both recreation the environment and now for commuting
1231435 our officers are keeping more guns off the streets and working harder to reduce those shootings
1231436 of course shot placement and medical advances have helped keep some of the shootings we have had from becoming murders but were working hard to get those numbers down
1231437 our officers are using a lot more computer generated stats to get a better look at the patterns of violence and that helps put them where we need more police presence
1231438 our officers are also making a lot more traffic stops and hopefully theyre getting more warrant arrests as well as traffic violations to keep the bad guys off the streets
1231439 we have meetings every tuesday to discuss our strategies when it comes to preventing violent crimes and the criminal sexual assault is one we spend a lot of time on
1231440 thats a tough one to answer other than that our officers are keeping their eyes open and doing everything they can to be seen in the community
1231441 thats a large increase yet its only eight more and the arson numbers can be deceiving especially since most of these are car fires
1231442 as times get tougher and tougher we see more folks trying to get out from under that payment
1231443 those are the best tools we have to keep aurora a safe place to work and live
1231444 but we cant sit back on these numbers we need to continue to be vigilant
1231445 its arbitrary and capricious to classify the first offense as sexual

1231447 i am afraid that he will find me hurt me and take our son every little sound i hear scares me
1231448 the question is what is it going to cost and who will use the building long term
1231449 where we can gain the advantage is if we resolve the problem first
1231450 if you have an employee who spends 22 minutes getting to a meeting youre paying for those 22 minutes
1231451 anything that moves traffic from highways to arterials is not going to work in this region
1231452 the main objective is to better understand the magnitude of the problem and where its occurring
1231453 the region that solves congestion problems first will have the competitive advantage

1231503 he had to have a contrast iv does he wear hearing aids hes awful hard to communicate with
1231504 really who did you talk to did you get her name
1231505 it would have been much easier for us if we had known he wore hearing aids did he bring them with him
1231506 he could have worn his hearing aids for the cat scan we had a terrible time getting him to understand he tried to get up twice i had to go in and talk to him a number of times
1231507 i had to come in here quite a few times
1231508 i dont understand why they have to keep it so cold in here its very cold so so very cold

1231515 and now for it to come to this is very very disappointing
1231516 we are going to try to be multi dimensional with him
1231517 we are going to line him up in the backfield direct snap the ball to him some and let him throw the ball some he and adam weber in the backfield together will create some issues for the defense

1231544 our mission of course is convoy security but this is part of our normal training that we do on a regular basis and so just getting the teams back up to a competency level where they feel confident moving forward into country
1231545 react to contact react to indirect fire its things that every soldier should know regardless of the mos some of the training weve been doing is theatre specific but for the most part while were here in hawaii were just getting back to the fundamentals

1231548 go rail now is a slogan go rail go is a slogan and an organization
1231549 were not working hand in hand our group has not taken a position on any of the mayoral candidates
1231550 myself and the other committee balance for transportation people felt that we should step down and let them run with it
1231551 we just wanted to support rail transit and find someone who would support it
1231552 they came to me they wanted this organization to use this 501 cr they came up with the go rail go
1231553 we just felt that we dont want to draw attention to us and to create this perception
1231554 they may have stepped down with the claim that they were not functioning i dont believe that because they were actively involved in the rail as we know it today
1231555 only god is perfect if i make something perfect ill knick it

1231560 you say in your statement you dont think youre a pervert or are violent
1231561 but eventually the person that asked you to do this will join you in prison ill make sure of that
1231562 the only person who knows that for sure is the defendant himself
1231563 i was the only person involved in this there was nobody else forcing me to do this

1231568 and learning a foreign language well means more than merely mastering the grammar pronunciation and words it also means learning native speakers culture including customs habits and social norms
1231569 society believes that if you are not good at english you dont qualify as a talent
1231570 we should also encourage people to learn multiple languages including french german and ancient chinese
1231571 hey italian or whatever other language is definitely my cup of tea
1231572 its meant to take people out of their comfort zone

1231632 the survey shows quite startlingly that the impact of slowing domestic demand is starting to take its toll on australian business accis director of industry policy and economics greg evans said in canberra
1231633 encouragingly on the inflation front both wage and non wage costs have indeed moderated as have business input prices he said
1231634 acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflation spiral despite headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent in the year to june mr evans said
1231635 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible

1231643 feel like shooting the fucking chinc foreign policy for interfering by exercising their veto vote un in support of juntas decision to disallow the aid workers into burma but when the shits hit the fan in their country they are begging everyone to come in and help china is making so much money and getting much needed energy supply out of burma and dumping its unsafe and inferior goods into burma and as long as the junta remains in power in burma china is laughing arseholes really and of course xxxxxx all them generals
1231644 when are we ever going to have to know this stuff
1231645 there was a man whose name i cannot even remember we were in the alexandria army hospital in the middle east he was a soldier who had suffered horrific combat injuries but by far the worst was the shrapnel had ripped the lower part of his face and jaw clean from his body he could not talk and could not eat and must have known he was going to die far from his home in constant pain all we could do was try and keep him calm as we waited for him to die for over a week expect for those miracles times he would lapse into unconsciousness this poor bugger would thrash and moan every day i would be forced to restrain him by holding his arms to his sides he would try and force my arms to the ground at the sides of the stretcher and i would hold him down day after day i shouldnt have but i did swear at him and curse him as we struggled the one day during one of our struggles he just stopped trying and passed away later that day the nurses came and cleaned the stretcher and sheets as they moved the stretcher we noticed a cardboard box we opened it and it contained over a dozen unopened letters from his wife and family apparently these letters had been following him around the battle field for many months and finally caught up with him in the hospital some over worked orderly must have placed them under his stretcher at some time before he had time to read them to the soldier all this time i had fought restrained and cursed this poor bugger all he was ever was trying to do was reach the letters under his bed to hear from his loved ones before he died we did open one of the letters you know his wife had enclosed pictures of his baby son jesus boy all the poor bastard wanted was to see his son and i stopped him

1231661 a 20 per cent rise next year might be achievable and there is certainly talk of a smaller one the year after
1231662 we dont subscribe to the theory that it is suddenly going to fall to the depths which some of the analysts do
1231663 why we dont subscribe to that theory is that all of the infrastructure is full at the moment so any new projects have roughly the same amount of capital intensity it doesnt matter if its us or bhp or rio
1231664 i think were also seeing projects are harder to develop than people think
1231665 were not convinced that all the projects out there will ramp up as quickly as has been talked about
1231666 there has been quite a push to move away from it
1231667 from what ive seen the steel makers and iron ore producers are relatively comfortable with it
1231668 we might move into a pricing separation based on some very high grade iron ore and some lower grade
1231669 weve seen that already with lump going up 95 per cent and fines only went up by 85 per cent
1231670 lump is getting harder to find and is a premium product
1231671 lenovos outlook is pressured by both easing pc demand growth in china and slower it spending in the united states it is hard for lenovo to maintain its high growth of last year
1231672 but we still like lenovos long term growth prospects given its strong positioning in china and growth in europe and the consumer business
1231673 cricket was part of the 1900 olympics when great britain beat france but with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
1231674 over the next century the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
1231675 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who have not yet caught the cricket bug
1231676 is it a realistic dream i really believe it is the icc has already taken the step to become a recognised olympic sport and that is the first step to becoming part of the olympic programme
1231677 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 percent of the worlds population in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members
1231678 i am very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1231679 its a huge honour for me and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1231680 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael vaughan and paul collingwood and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1231681 so i saw my opportunities in the uk where selection is merit based
1231682 my parents were in shock my mother was crying when they were swearing and shouting traitor people were hysterical
1231683 when i walk out there and they boo me im definitely up for the challenge and i wanted to prove coming over to england four or five years ago was the right decision
1231684 ive never heard so much rubbish in all my life when england claim to be unsure about selecting him for tests
1231685 on track to take part in the limited overs segment of the tour
1231686 i am disappointed and it was a surprise because this is a player who has played in the champions league and been in the argentina squad for the olympic games you have managers talking about how good he is so i think the system needs to change
1231687 now we have to look for a solution maybe find a team for him on loan but we have maybe eight or 10 teams in spain italy and greece asking about him when you have eight or 10 teams asking about a player and hes not playing it means that he is good
1231688 hopefully in the future if hes playing in the champions league maybe someone will say oh we made a mistake
1231689 i think the situation is still ongoing the transfer negotiations are still going on as far as i know i havent spoken to the chief executive so i cant tell you more than that hes the one negotiating with everton
1231690 i think so ive no reason to believe he wont andy johnson is a player with great quality wherever hes been hes done very very well hell give us balance up front that were looking for
1231691 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1231692 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1231693 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1231694 my immediate priority will be this weeks fourth npower test and i will be devoting all my energies to ensuring that the team are properly prepared and play to their full potential starting on thursday

1231706 last camp there was cecil sapp at running back mike bell travis henry and me and selvin werent really getting any reps
1231707 now a few of those guys are gone it really gives me and selvin a lot more opportunities
1231708 last year it was just mental reps for me just hoping to get two or three plays in a whole day of practice
1231709 more work has helped i see stuff before it happens the game is just a lot slower now
1231710 theres not so much weight on my shoulders i can relax now but i always worry about getting cut thats how i play either im going to be here or im not and i feel like if im messing up im not going to be here every down is serious to me
1231711 i cant update every time there is a rumor out there
1231712 if he gets suspended two three or four games it will hurt the team but it will give other guys an opportunity to step up

1231714 youre always concerned when one of your best players is having problems but i am not concerned that tom needs to play in the preseason

1231724 there are rules that govern how a species is names and described as long as those rules are followed and as long as the paper that the names are published in passes peer review once the names are formally published theyre in use forever
1231725 i think that people are under the impression that most species have been discovered and described
1231726 has brought some attention to biodiversity studies and the idea that there are new species out there while there are about 40 000 species of spiders that have been described gosh there could be twice as many at least another 40 000 out there remaining to be discovered

1231735 the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain
1231736 so when sen mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis
1231737 its important to remember that hes been part of that failure
1231738 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1231739 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1231740 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1231741 it disappoints me to be in a position the night before the event when our teams should be celebrating the fact that theyve beaten four very good mexican teams and playing each other of having to have a media call about in the words of some it might have been the union that it is now just an exhibition
1231742 we feel our rights according to the cba have been violated
1231743 we feel we needed a bigger voice we wanted to show that were united as players
1231744 were going out there to win a championship and secure a berth in next years superliga
1231745 i just want to say im happy two mls teams reached the final
1231746 it would be a real highlight for us to be superliga champions
1231747 its just a personal situation ive got some personal things going on in dallas that need attending to
1231748 i think he felt that he had never worked at a place where it was so hard to get things done
1231749 he had to work a whole year to get three vet techs hired
1231750 barc has made improvements and hiring kent was one of those improvements
1231751 weve come pretty close to turning around the culture how the bureau operates
1231752 kent was good about working with volunteers and increasing adoptions he had the right agenda he just didnt have the resources
1231753 were sorry to see him go we thought he was making some great progress
1231754 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1231755 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1231756 its absolutely our duty to detain those who are responsible in the coming days
1231757 its inexcusable that the government finds itself overwhelmed by various expressions of organized crime
1231758 we have 2 million reasons for him to be returned to us
1231759 dallasblog has learned that texas railroad commissioner elizabeth ames jones definitely will run for the u s senate seat being vacated by sen kay bailey hutchison in 2010 or earlier
1231760 we dont know what senator hutchison is going to do
1231761 i watch people on the news being asked if theyd like to be vice president
1231762 we could be in a world of trouble in five years when this plays out
1231763 unfortunately poor minority and low achieving students are far more likely to be taught by an under qualified teacher than their more affluent white and high achieving peers
1231764 the students most in need of the most qualified teachers are the least likely to be taught by them
1231765 otherwise we will continue to have the inequity its not going to go away
1231766 its been shown that the most important factor in closing the achievement gaps is the work of an effective teacher we need to get as many as we can in the right places
1231767 how to make your teachers quit they would look at what the state of texas does
1231768 we place brand new teachers in very hard to teach schools we dont have strong mentoring programs and they get very frustrated
1231769 where they have a fighting chance that at least three quarters of the student body will pass the test

1231776 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1231777 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1231778 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75

1231800 its a really busy intersection with the traffic on va 42 and traffic coming off mount crawford avenue weve been real pleased about how everythings gone
1231801 workably competitive although restricted by factors such as limited incentives for price competition between the major players
1231802 consider the best way to introduce a mandatory national unit pricing scheme as recommended by the commission
1231803 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined the report said
1231804 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1231805 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and aldi had been a
1231806 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1231807 significant buying power due to the fact that suppliers had very little option but to deal with them
1231808 it would seem that this dilemma we in belltown have to endure has eluded our mayor police chief and the city council
1231809 what does it take to get the attention of our mayor our top cop
1231810 i cant tell you how many times people have had their store windows shot out
1231811 bullets are flying its the wild wild west down here especially thursday friday and saturday nights
1231812 everyone knows they can come here and get a free pass for driving drunk for disturbing the peace for dealing
1231813 the need for beat cops is so obvious as to be blinding in its simplicity
1231814 thank you for bringing to my attention your concerns regarding the increasingly dangerous situation
1231815 as a seattle native i have watched this increase and i too am concerned the situation in belltown is unacceptable
1231816 it follows that we should expect the highest level of service
1231817 he told me sometimes you have to measure your wins and losses in something other than the final score
1231818 tony won a lot but there were some mid 1990s as teams that he knew werent going to win so the goal is just to be better each day
1231819 i love to manage ask anybody who knows me and theyll say that managing is what makes me tick but i dont you can go around managing just to try and save your job
1231820 hes strong enough he could have thrown 130 pitches if we had to and if we were in the pennant race in a game we had to win he probably would have gone out there for the sixth i dont know
1231821 but if im here next year or somebody else is i want to do what i can to make sure that felix is healthy that everybody is healthy if i wanted to win for myself i could have let him pitch more but that in my mind wouldnt be right
1231822 we were going to go two days on one day off
1231823 but hes feeling good today and we dont want to take any chances
1231824 im kind of curious id like to see him do it but ive been more aggressive about it than i should have been
1231825 when i see j j throw two days in a row and throw like he did sunday then ill know
1231826 he was able to maintain his velocity and he had good depth on his split finger from the side angle we have it almost looked like a curve
1231827 i think safeco is about three miles further of a drive but i dont mind
1231828 coming out of camp i didnt expect to be sent down and i was and i was upset before i know it its july or august and my numbers are horrible it was too late
1231829 hes been in the big leagues with the angels been in the big leagues with us and did his job and did his job well
1231830 he kind of put himself behind the 8 ball when he went down by not saying you know what they sent me down and im going to prove to them every time i go out there that they made a mistake he went down he got upset and he let it affect the way he pitched
1231831 this year i wasnt worried about what was going on up here or how guys were throwing
1231832 i just tried to do my thing if it happened it happened if it didnt it didnt i could live with myself either way
1231833 quite honestly when you watch him throw its not that impressive
1231834 i dont mean that in a bad way what is impressive is that he just continues to get people out he doesnt throw 100 theres nothing that just lights up the world but he gets them out
1231835 for me thats whats impressive about jake he makes his throws he doesnt panic in big situations and he keeps the ball down and gets guys out
1231836 he shows that he can come in out of the bullpen and throw the ball over the plate theres no magic secret its not a matter of developing another pitch or anything hes just got to show that he can command
1231837 former manager john mclaren told me that when they sent me down out of camp this is the year youve got to make or break
1231838 obviously guys still make it after that but im getting to the point where im at the age that its yes or its no
1231839 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
1231840 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
1231841 it would be better to do exercise than to take a pill

1231846 the police investigation in the early period following ms childs death unfortunately did not capture some items of evidence which are no longer available to the current investigating police

1231848 my greatest fear is that we do find this murderer and that greatest fear is we find out because hes done this to somebody else

1231894 the course of a creative life is littered with lots of crappy temp jobs its nice to get paid for living your dream but the truth is the real benefit of an artistic life comes in the joy and excitement of the work itself the moments that no one else can experience when you are in the story and you are surrounded by magic

1232006 the police investigation in the early period following ms childs death unfortunately did not capture some items of evidence which are no longer available to the current investigating police

1232019 in our contemporary pluralistic world where a cross cultural communication has increasingly become a matter of necessity for global survival a new consciousness is emerging one of the major features of this consciousness is going to be a non sectarian spirituality a universal spirituality is at the root of all traditions but is continually lost in theological exclusivism or in scholastic partiality or in evangelical enthusiasm and needs to be rediscovered and restated anew again and again anybody who would approach a major work of a religious tradition with a global perspective and with an effort to discover the universal truths in it will aid the development of the new consciousness in the right direction
1232020 everywhere the one truth and one being or simply the one has manifested itself in many truths myriad beings and many selves corresponding to different times places cultures religions and needs each language has its own particular genius and some things can be expressed in it in a way which is especially profound and engaging nevertheless no language has a monopoly on depth of discourse nor does any particular language exhaust all possibilities of communication in fact at its best as one sees in love and in the utterances of so many mystics and sages a language may most succeed as it carries one to the silence beyond any articulation similarly each religious and spiritual tradition has its own beauty and emphasis and certain truths are most profoundly expressed in and perhaps in it alone nevertheless no tradition exhausts all possibilities of the vastness as no being exhausts all modalities of being
1232021 still even the practice of a path not only its theory can be illumined by a light coming from another tradition what is important to appreciate is that no spiritual path can be true if it is essentially devised here below by human reasoning a true path depends on the will of heaven it originates from above
1232022 the way however is not the goal and a person can too easily get excessively attached to a particular way or a teacher
1232023 for myself i am happy to find light wherever i can without thereby having to deny other sources of illumination or other colours of the spectrum which together can more fully express the glory and abundance of the vastness than any one can alone
1232024 an american homosexual takes the old script of self hatred the scrip of the closet the sescript in which he is a faggot and works in community with others to construct a series of positive gay life scripts

1232079 i believe that the defense is on firm ground saying that this is a case of political persecution
1232080 in fact i am hard pressed to find another case just like it
1232081 the prosecutions conduct is typical of the bush administration in that it will not accept defeat whether from a jury or a judge

1232090 but the lockout was one part of a number of strategies weve got in place
1232091 the hard line confrontational policy the united states has embraced under the bush administration has inadvertently demonstrated the limits of u
1232092 the rejection of diplomacy has reduced the united states to a condition of self inflicted powerlessness regarding many problems
1232093 the vacuum is being filled in part by u s adversaries iran syria hamas and hezbollah and in part by friendly arab regimes which seek to find a way forward in situations where u s policy has contributed to stalemate
1232094 the new arab diplomacy not with the u s and not against the u s
1232095 many essentially friendly countries are openly willing to pursue policies the united states disapproves of presenting washington with a fait accompli and the choice of either openly criticizing the action of its so called allies or grudgingly tolerating it

1232100 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible

1232235 the evora is the biggest milestone lotus has achieved since the elise was born 13 years ago and is part of our bold five year strategic plan which includes the introduction of new cars and technologies to many more markets around the world the evora also represents lotus core values of performance through light weight and efficiency and proves that you can have phenomenal performance fuel efficiency elegant design and practicality all in a class leading mid engine 2 2 sportscar which will meet global safety and homologation standards
1232236 looking to the future we will continue to research develop and produce lighter more efficient vehicles which are linked to our extensive and well regarded work on all aspects of future fuels alternative engines and electric and hybrid vehicle solutions for the future we all have an environmental responsibility to future generations and the evora is another example where lotus is seen to make significant steps towards improving the efficiency and sustainability of the motorcar keeping britain at the forefront of the high technology motor industry
1232237 a cornerstone of the designs success was working closely with the technical team to develop a package that allowed us to get the proportions correct
1232238 the asymmetric wheel sizes the short rear overhang long front overhang and cab forward visor screen all contribute to giving the car visual movement and an agile stance this is incredibly important to us because we want the cars aesthetics to communicate its driving characteristics
1232239 we never lost sight of the fact that although this car must provide real world useability sportscars are emotional purchases and that you have to seduce the customer through beguiling looks and exotic persona we are therefore very proud that we have been able to use technical and user functionality to positively drive the design in key areas and create some of the cars most distinctive features
1232240 we believe that our designs should be honest as well as dramatic and so we are really pleased with the fact that these iconic features all do a real job
1232241 overall the design language shows a clear dna link with its lotus siblings whilst establishing its own distinctive and contemporary theme the undulating shoulder line is brilliantly mirrored in the lower part of the bodyside by the cut away sill that creates a torseau like muscularity
1232242 your eye is drawn effortlessly from our signature mouth rearward by fluid surfaces and fast lines that create a sense of speed even when the car is stationary from this angle you can also see how dramatically the visor screen sweeps around the teardrop form of the cabin and the gently waisted plan shape perfectly accentuates the muscularity of the rear fender this is unmistakeably mid engined language and the evora is unmistakeably a lotus
1232243 a huge departure from what people might expect based on lotuss recent past we wanted the evoras cabin to feel special and to be surprising as well as sporty precision engineered metal inserts and quality edge lit switches are brilliantly juxtaposed against soft hand stitched leather surfaces to give a modern interior with a classic twist
1232244 the flat bottomed steering wheel figure hugging sports seat contemporary instrumentation and ergonomically positioned controls provide an intuitive environment that instantly forms a connection between driver and car ensuring that it becomes an extension of his or her body
1232245 tactile quality is incredibly important within this segment and so we wanted the interior to use honest premium materials much of the switchgear is bespoke and every metallic component is actually metal
1232246 this year lotus celebrates its 60th anniversary and it is fitting that 2008 is also the birth of the lotus evora a fantastic addition to the lotus range the lotus evora represents group lotus a company that is at the forefront of the automotive industry in a changing world where priorities of efficiency economy and environmental impact go hand in hand with performance design and individuality i think colin chapman would have approved
1232247 you know apostle bishop right reverend prophet jones has an anointing on his life and that anointing isnt on a convenient flight schedule apostle bishop right reverend prophet jones has been called by god to minister to the nations and he needs a ministry tool that will catapult him to the forefront of evangelical outreach thus the need for a private jet

1232249 i havent talked to howard about this or anything related i have full support of everything hes doing but weve had no contact about this
1232250 was conceived by slade gorton and wally walker it was timed and intended to derail the nbas vote on the pbcs request to locate to oklahoma city and rehabilitate the image of howard schultz who some hold responsible for the sonics potential departure but the nba approved relocation the team has moved and schultzs image depends on more important things
1232251 any hope that plaintiffs could renew their season tickets left with them
1232252 neither the city of seattle nor the nba are parties here but plaintiffs claim a right to have this court drag the team and the nba back for two more years of games plaintiffs dont intend to buy tickets for or attend at a venue the team no longer has a right to use
1232253 this is absurd no such contract right exists and plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief must be dismissed
1232254 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter

1232349 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
1232350 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
1232351 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
1232352 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
1232353 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
1232354 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
1232355 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
1232356 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
1232357 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
1232358 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
1232359 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
1232360 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
1232361 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
1232362 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
1232363 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
1232364 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
1232365 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
1232366 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
1232367 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
1232368 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
1232369 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
1232370 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
1232371 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage

1232377 my comment would be that i think that was the same journalist that wrote there was a cell phone involved that the packers gave
1232378 i think people have to beings the economy is as tough as it is people have to watch their money a little closer
1232379 for me for example im only going to be here three days instead of a week because im also going to the rally down in milwaukee so im going to have to split my time up between the two
1232380 i just basically come with so much money and then i just watch what i spend
1232381 been saving all year and we actually made the decision to do tent camping instead of hotels and things like that to help budget the money
1232382 well we decided if we save money on lodging basically and things like that then we could spend more money on entertainment
1232383 you dont have to spend a lot to have fun you can make it as expensive as you want or as cheap as you want
1232384 my game was a little bit better than what it is now
1232385 im a little rusty but im 44 now i actually do some coaching some jv coaching at a high school in my area but my game was okay for awhile
1232386 moving to rapid city was real fun id never been in that area in my life the fans were awesome we ended up winning the championship that year so it turned out real good
1232387 theres a round steering wheel and a round basketball little bit of hand eye coordination i guess if youre a natural athlete i dont know if it helps you i know theres some race car drivers that have no clue on a stick or ball sport so i dont really think theres any comparison
1232388 the cage is about two inches taller the a frame sits back i feel like i sit down in this car like a normal guy but its just a little bit taller its built for me its hard for me to get into somebody elses car and just run it maybe a weekend here or there its got to be kind of a special car and built for me
1232389 as long as im still competitive and in a good car ill go for a little while when guys start beating me up and knocking me around a little bit and i start losing my nerve then its probably time to go
1232390 we talk to people about moving here and they start asking us about gosh this would be a great place to retire or raise a family because of all the wonderful things
1232391 a job opened up here and i was in that transitional point professionally
1232392 so just having an opportunity and the knowing that it was time to see family
1232393 i like waving at people when i drive by them and theres been a lot of familiar faces
1232394 coming back the experiences i had in the big city i can find here
1232395 thats appealing and also things are more affordable here and thats really appealing
1232396 im hoping to by the beginning of october to find something
1232397 its just a matter of what part of town to move into now
1232398 sioux falls has always maintained a progressive spirit thats why we have the convention center thats why we have the pavillion the parks system and softball fields
1232399 we have to maintain that competitive spirit and always look forward and continue to serve needs
1232400 i just looked at him and said we could have been on the road when these guys were on the road out doing this
1232401 sounded like they had nothing better to do so they were out driving and drinking
1232402 our fear is someday somebody is going to get killed its every year at least five to six accidents a year
1232403 its frustrating when you come across a person with their fourth or fifth dui that theyre still out driving around
1232404 probably got his first one when he was 21 and kept on going and hasnt learned
1232405 i mean five times thats not one or two thats five
1232406 what were doing is called a break in period for the new lights
1232407 i know it is a little unusual to have the rights on during the day and obviously wed rather not be using the electricity but ultimately what we want is to make sure were getting what were paying for with regard to the quality of lights we have out there
1232408 the lights on those new softball fields are far enough away from our place i dont think it will be a problem at all
1232409 i can build a mac pro for half the price

1232540 everything known to the chinese by the year 1430 was brought to venice
1232541 i argue in the book that this was the spark that really ignited the renaissance and that leonardo and italian astronomer galileo built on what was brought to them by the chinese
1232542 leonardo basically redrew everything in three dimensions which made a vast improvement
1232543 1434 the year a magnificent chinese fleet sailed to italy and ignited the renaissance
1232544 this whole fantasy about europe discovering the world is just nonsense
1232545 by comparing leonardos drawings with the nung shu we have verified that each element of a machine superbly illustrated by leonardo had previously been illustrated by the chinese in a much simpler manual
1232546 its very suggestive very interesting but the hard work remains to be done
1232547 he menzies says something is a copy just because they look similar he says two things are almost identical when they are not
1232548 i will keep my eye open without thinking it is going to turn leonardo studies or any studies of 15th century technology upside down
1232549 there is a whole series of questions a historian would ask about mediaeval technology about islamic technology about transmission across trade routes the silk route in particular
1232550 its a terrifically complicated area and having a chinese person in florence in 1434 ends up giving that person a hell of a lot of work to do
1232551 in the days of pope eugenius there came a chinese ambassador to him
1232552 no reputable scholar would think that there is any reason to suppose that the person referred to by toscanelli was chinese
1232553 certainly chinese ideas came to europe and european ideas went to iran and onwards
1232554 but the premise of the book that there was a chinese fleet in 1434 which went to italy is completely without any substance
1232555 i say the claim that critics make that there is no evidence is absolute rubbish there is stacks and stacks of evidence
1232556 its not me thats the fantasist its the historians who persist in this complete rubbish which is currently taught as history
1232557 say anything wrote that song about me cause my gay ex blanko still obsesses over me and he actually had to pay them money to do it

1232565 my chart is made of 1 000 m amp ms they are in 100 lines of 10 m amp ms we glued them down with hot glue it was hard cn and mv helped me
1232566 we did 100 tens because its even and 1 000 is even so we were pretty sure we could get there we made 100 arrays of 10 then we cut the arrays out and glued them to the board it was difficult because we had to draw and cut out every single one
1232567 there are one thousand tallies on my project there are eight pages of tallies on my project and 125 tallies on each page that brings me to a total of 1 000 tallies
1232568 here is how we made our twenty fifty charts first we measured twenty ten by five charts then we cut them out and wrote the proper numbers then we pasted the charts on the board
1232569 dont try this at home we made a massive 1000 chart it measures 8 feet and 5 inches it took five days to complet jl says it was very stressful because as was sick for two days

1232591 limos consensual governance model and balanced collaborative development methodology have set it apart from other platform initiatives and continue to garner wide industry support
1232592 these 11 new members will join the development of a consistent and competitive global handset os operating system within which the collaborative benefits of shared cost and innovation are realized and upon which diverse commercially driven differentiation freely thrives
1232593 limo greatly appreciates the commitment to openness and collaboration taken by all of our new members todays announcement includes several former lips forum participants that have chosen to redirect their resources into limo in order to drive unification of the mobile ecosystem
1232594 limos broad industry engagement demonstrates the fact that limo offers an open transparent and equitable opportunity for established industry players and newcomers alike to shape and drive innovation within the limo platform
1232595 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1232596 the combination of limos transparent governance model balanced development model and extensive mobile industry heritage sets it apart and has garnered strong industry support and engagement
1232597 this next wave of limo handsets points to the innovation that will flow as the industry coalesces on the limo platform
1232598 limo was founded on the notion that fragmentation of the mobile industry among dozens of proprietary closed operating systems was inhibiting innovation
1232599 with such a variety of industry players cost effectively adopting the limo platform for non differentiating handset middleware more development resources are being devoted to enhancing the consumer experience this new wave of limo handsets serves as proof

1232668 the ecb will likely maintain the refinancing rate at 4 25 percent
1232669 despite increasing downside risks to growth ecb president jean claude trichet will probably renew warnings on the central banks commitment to fight second round effects he should stick to the neutral bias mantra
1232670 clearly a further interest rate hike is a real possibility and the ecb is very likely to keep talking tough on inflation
1232671 nevertheless we believe that 4 25 percent will mark the peak in euro zone interest rates although any cut is extremely unlikely to occur until 2009
1232672 we expect markedly weaker euro zone growth softening labor markets extended tight credit conditions and the strong euro to largely contain and then increasingly dilute underlying inflation pressures over the coming months
1232673 the boe should leave the rate at 5 percent this week
1232674 unchanged interest rates seem by far the most probable outcome
1232675 but it is not inconceivable that interest rates could be either raised or cut

1232704 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
1232705 joint secretary of unite against fascism weyman bennett spoke to socialist worker about the rise of the bnp and about how we can defeat the fascists
1232706 the bnp can be beaten fifteen years ago the fascists broke through in elections in tower hamlets winning a council seat
1232707 they were driven back by united community campaigning and a national movement led by the anti nazi league and others now it is respect which is proud of multicultural london and which stands up for minorities which has broken through in the east end
1232708 that means we were able to push the bnp into fourth place in the east london constituency at the london elections in may despite their dangerously high votes in outer east london
1232709 no one can be complacent though the bnp did win a seat on the gla
1232710 we in respect are committed to fighting the bnp on two fronts
1232711 we in respect also believe that unless we tackle the crisis over housing the spiralling food and fuel bills that are hitting millions of people the hopelessness in so many areas of the country and the sheer lack of representation for working people then the bnp are always going to find people they can con into supporting them
1232712 this labour government is failing across the board the tories and far worse the bnp hope to build out of peoples despair
1232713 respect seeks to offer hope at the ballot box and alongside all those struggling for a decent society
1232714 where respect is strongest in south birmingham tower hamlets and newham where we have councillors the bnp are pushed to the margins
1232715 so as well as a broad movement against the bnp respect is trying to expand and wants to work with other progressive people to provide a credible political alternative anchored as labour at its best once was in local working class communities black asian amp white

1232854 the picture youve just painted is of a church that is more like a democracy everyone has a say everyone can be a priest whatever gender married or not etc fine but if you really believe the catholic church is not merely a human institution but rather that god is guiding it then does it really matter who or what gender is the humanly visible leader
1232855 exactly it doesnt matter whether a man or woman is ordained is pope etc god is leading the church
1232856 it seems to me your whole position is that something is right only if the church declares it so

1232890 when i looked at these materials in their entirety i felt that these were definitely not just bike thieves
1232891 all these suggested that there were definitely enough grounds in my opinion to grant the police custody of nasir and asadullah to facilitate further investigations
1232892 why dont the police put us all together in jail

1232904 by summits end the howard era seemed to have vanished into history
1232905 of course there is a danger here of political optical illusion
1232906 while keatings striking redfern speech probably had on balance an alienating impact on public opinion the depth and deftness of rudds february speech on the stolen generations converted many australians to the idea of an apology
1232907 what had the summit achieved one thousand members of the political class had assembled for a weekend the atmosphere was generally optimistic the process frenzied and chaotic over that time hundreds of ideas had been produced
1232908 some were fundamental the republic the bill of rights a compact or treaty between indigenous and non indigenous australians a new federation commission a national development index concerning social inclusion a national endowment fund for the arts an entire overhaul of the tax system a seamless national economy
1232909 rudds summit signalled the end of the era of the breakdown of relations between government and all but a small circle of the intelligentsia bill heffernan thought the summit therapeutic he was right

1232920 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1232921 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1232922 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1232923 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1232924 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined

1232943 wine is the way the earth gets to speak to us
1232944 this sounds like what the industry calls a translation memory
1232945 rather than extend the current approach of commercial bank regulation to investment banks i believe congress and regulators must recognize that different regulatory structures are needed for oversight of these industries
1232946 put simply regulatory reform should not and need not amount to the elimination of the investment banking business model
1232947 it hit me so hard i stopped washing my hair and wearing make up
1232948 i was so depressed that i started binge eating on burgers and pie and mash i was so scared of how it was affecting me that i said i cant do this any more and went home and locked myself away
1232949 when the vicar told me his work was so valuable that they were going to write a book about him i felt a huge weight coming off my shoulders it was an astonishing story
1232950 that was the moment i stopped eating burgers and started washing my hair

1232959 but he wasnt happy he couldnt find his place in the new russia he was like a breath of fresh air to us but his fate was very tragic
1232960 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
1232961 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that alexander isaevich lived a difficult but happy life
1232962 its a great loss for our family its also a loss for the country
1232963 he was always really happy he returned this is his home
1232964 he was a writer first and his resistance came from that
1232965 he criticized the soviet union not as a westerner but as a russian with deep orthodox values
1232966 he was trying to find a third way for russia
1232967 for me he opened my eyes to a new side of life that i had never heard about
1232968 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
1232969 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1232970 the entire thorny path of his life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1232971 and now for it to come to this is very very disappointing
1232972 i thought i was in the best shape of my life this summer i am motivated now to get that much better and make it harder to pass on me

1232991 we dont subscribe to the theory that it is suddenly going to fall to the depths which some of the analysts do
1232992 why we dont subscribe to that theory is that all of the infrastructure is full at the moment so any new projects have roughly the same amount of capital intensity it doesnt matter if its us or bhp or rio
1232993 i think were also seeing projects are harder to develop than people think
1232994 were not convinced that all the projects out there will ramp up as quickly as has been talked about
1232995 there has been quite a push to move away from it
1232996 from what ive seen the steel makers and iron ore producers are relatively comfortable with it
1232997 we might move into a pricing separation based on some very high grade iron ore and some lower grade
1232998 weve seen that already with lump going up 95 per cent and fines only went up by 85 per cent
1232999 lump is getting harder to find and is a premium product

1233023 he admitted to it but his story was that he was drunk and didnt even remember doing it
1233024 he has said he wants to speak to me to apologise so the police are arranging for us to meet up
1233025 he didnt hurt me but i was very shaken luckily ive now got my bike back

1233032 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1233033 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1233034 being called smelly can be damaging to our personality in that sense deodorant products can be used as a confidence booster
1233035 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself

1233084 with heikki yesterdays result was fully justified and very much deserved hes had his fair share of bad luck during the early part of the season and his win in hungary showed that hed let none of that misfortune pile up on his shoulders
1233085 and weve seen with all our other drivers that once they get that winning feeling its something they want to keep doing
1233086 clearly we are targeting ferrari in the constructors championship and it will only be to our benefit to have both our drivers pushing as hard as possible to close down that points gap
1233087 in our second stint i think we started to turn our fortunes around we pitted later than felipe fuelled lewis significantly longer than the ferrari and had a performance advantage despite the heavier fuel load we felt confident that we would have been in a significantly stronger position going into the last stint but unfortunately lewiss tyre problem not only forced him to complete the best part of a lap on a flat tyre he suffered the failure at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two but also caused him to pit earlier than anticipated this not only negated the fuel advantage he was originally carrying but forced him to look after his super soft tyres over a far longer stint than we had originally anticipated that he managed to do that so effortlessly is a great testament to his presence of mind and his fifth position during an afternoon of damage limitation was a truly impressive result
1233088 its a testament not just to our design and windtunnel teams but also to our model making and manufacturing departments that we have been able to bring so many new items like these to recent races and our aggressive development strategy shows no sign of slowing down this is where the world championship will be won or lost weve seen it happen before

1233098 i have been selling shares for the past nine months this is the lowest level the portfolio has had in 10 years
1233099 we have cashed up which is very important in times of uncertainty
1233100 western australia and queensland would laugh if you used the word recession
1233101 all the evidence is that there will be more work coming through the receivers
1233102 there will be a lot of opportunities over the next 12 months so we still have a way to go
1233103 we have looked at basically everything that has been listed

1233123 we are policemen so if we need it we can use it for traffic stops and other incidents
1233124 it will respond to calls and we will make a stop with it if we need to
1233125 we have a great department in that they are very committed to the community
1233126 this will help them get out and closer to the community
1233127 a squad car only gets 10 miles a gallon but this gets 30
1233128 but this is really a conversation starter its really designed to break down the barriers between a police officer and the community that a squad car creates
1233129 i did make it clear to the team that i wouldnt be coming back this season after the olympics
1233130 i want them to be able to get a team together and didnt want to leave any doors open
1233131 i wanted to make sure they had their opportunity to get a full strength team and not wait for anyone
1233132 its disappointing but it gave me the opportunity to prepare for this major event
1233133 oh my god its muggy out and warm ive missed that
1233134 its a raunchy womans road trip story its thelma and louise with a happy ending funny and heartwarming
1233135 riley deftly weaves a story about such potentially depressing topics within the framework of a funny book without being insensitive no easy task
1233136 driving sideways is the most entertaining book ive read all year i loved it if youre like me and you love sarcastic humor youd enjoy this book too there were times that id laugh until i had tears in my eyes
1233137 bob used to be pretty aggressive in his patrol we had a lot of weeds and bushes we didnt send any letters didnt call anybody
1233138 id like to end my stay with the city by saying im from batavia and im proud of it
1233139 so we rented a car and drove we have to be here to check everything
1233140 we just sat here and watched the planes take off and land
1233141 its hard for them it takes years to build up enough trust to let us take care of their instruments
1233142 were on our way to greatly increasing economic development on the rand road corridor
1233143 this would be one of the most modern dealerships youd have anywhere in the u s
1233144 even though the economy in the u s and around here are in a recession or close to a recession theres nothing holding us back
1233145 this is probably a 25 million investment on the dealerships part
1233146 they had to get all their ducks in a row
1233147 some establishments dont really need a 3 a m license
1233148 your making more money with the extra hour so you can afford it
1233149 bonne journ e tous et si on ne se revoit pas tats unis
1233150 it is the best job in the ioc because you have the honour to represent the voice of the athlete i think frankie will take the athletes commission to the next level hes a perfect fit for the role
1233151 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquility on the future of the olympic torch relay
1233152 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1233153 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1233154 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1233155 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1233156 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1233157 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1233158 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1233159 the more the better for an old guy like me
1233160 it looks better than it was when i was here a few months ago but to be honest for us the smog actually helps
1233161 i can actually see those little orange disks a lot better in the sky than with a perfect white background
1233162 so as many cars as they want to get on the road the day i compete id be quite happy about
1233163 weve been aware of this matter for a very long time
1233164 were checking the air quality readings all the time and were determined to get on with the job
1233165 we havent had any athletes that have expressed any desire to go home its not a matter of concern to the athletes weve done this matter until were blue in the face so to speak
1233166 cadel will be flying in tomorrow and the news is that hell definitely be riding in the road race
1233167 and depending on how he goes after that he may ride in the time trial but that wont be decided until after the road race
1233168 we were devastated after athens and resolved to make whatever changes were necessary to address any shortcomings
1233169 our plan has been driven very much by the athens experience and not wishing to repeat it
1233170 by the end of august we will know how successful we have been in our approach
1233171 athletes from overseas spent a lot of time in australia in the build up to 2000 this meant we didnt have to travel to the extent that we would normally leading to savings that could be spent in other areas
1233172 preparations for the 2004 olympics in europe were expensive and were made more so because of inflation and the relative strength of the dollar against european currencies at the time
1233173 in an expensive equipment based sport this had a significant impact on all areas of our program and the ability of our athletes to properly prepare all this coupled with the benefits of the familiarity of a home games in 2000 certainly had an impact in 2004
1233174 ra has willfully and not so skillfully chosen to ignore and evade the fundamental question

1233180 yes and coupled with your training and rather unique qualifications your looking like them allowed you to go where no one else could go you were instrumental in our victory you should be proud
1233181 my people i have no people now im nowhere close to human and you exterminated everyone of what you turned me into you didnt bother to tell me id wind up alone and stuck looking like this
1233182 as i recall you agreed to this project because and i quote you had nothing to lose
1233183 you were pretty clear about that when you were trying to get yourself killed in special ops we saved you from yourself erik gave you purpose cleaned your slate you cant just expect everything to go back the way it was before

1233196 the survey shows quite startlingly that the impact of slowing domestic demand is starting to take its toll on australian business accis director of industry policy and economics greg evans said in canberra
1233197 encouragingly on the inflation front both wage and non wage costs have indeed moderated as have business input prices he said
1233198 acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflation spiral despite headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent in the year to june mr evans said
1233199 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible

1233254 i grew up in the cultural openness and wild sacred energy of southern california
1233255 rather than returning to the cultural comforts of california i remained in the more challenging context of the east coast attending yale university for four years then moving to new york city
1233256 at age 19 i became consciously christian under the guidance of the father of a college roommate vine deloria senior a lakota sioux episcopal priest

1233268 for us to take the ball and go home right now would be very detrimental
1233269 although it seems harsh and it may not have been a conscious choice but subconsciously she did attract that action

1233271 if you will pay me lots of money i will teach you
1233272 you obviously have not followed my teachings correctly it worked for me and many others so you must not have done it right i am sorry but i can no longer teach you unless you pay me more money and do it right this time

1233277 were convinced our arguments are solid and were convinced the voters really wanted the amendment to come into effect immediately
1233278 throughout the entire process i felt like i had no rights
1233279 i felt like the laws were there they just werent being enforced
1233280 and that was when i was like you know what
1233281 i couldnt touch anything because everything was covered in this white crappy stuff
1233282 i could hear my cat wheezing and i was thinking oh great i had my windows open no warning no nothing they just did it
1233283 it was embarrassingly funny because there were men in white suits all around the house that was roped off
1233284 we washed every single rug every piece of clothing curtains
1233285 i was worried about her because she is an elderly woman
1233286 i would come home and her face would be all red and i would say was the landlord just here he knew how to push her buttons

1233288 after a minute or two of silence he stated to mrs
1233289 that is when i got out of the chair stood between joseph bianchini and mrs christian and told him to leave the premises
1233290 he asked me if i ever heard of a landlord being arrested
1233291 she wanted me to go for the 1 000 a day for every day that the gas was off
1233292 just leave me alone to me there should be a law like that if a landlord is going to harass their tenants and not take care of a building it is obvious they are a slumlord
1233293 just because i dont own a property or anything i am going to lose they can do to you what they want and treat you however you dont own anything so you are nobody
1233294 the stress was enormous we didnt have anywhere to live

1233300 though both confucius and mo di died long ago their followers are still growing in number and their disciples have flourished so abundantly that they fill the whole world the heirs of the learning of confucius and mo di who have attained eminence and glory in the eyes of the world number into a multitude the number is so great as to be uncountable for everything which influenced them attained the proper standard

1233303 good men even if all the buddhas of the ten directions were to speak continuously for as many eons
1233304 those wishing to achieve these merits and virtues should cultivate ten vast and great practices and vows what are these ten first pay homage and respect to all buddhas fourth repent misdeeds and evil karma fifth rejoice at others merits and virtues sixth request the buddhas to turn the dharma wheel seventh request the buddhas to remain in the world eigth follow the teachings of the buddhas at all times ninth accommodate and benefit all living beings tenth transfer all merits and virtues universally
1233305 it includes beings who dwell in different villages towns cities and palaces as well as gods dragons and others of the eight divisions humans and non humans alike
1233306 i will be a good doctor for the sick and suffering
1233307 it is like a great regal tree growing in the rocks and sand of barren wilderness
1233308 why is this it is because by benefitting living beings with the water of great compassion the bodhisattvas can attain supreme perfect enlightenment therefore bodhi belongs to living beings without living beings no bodhisattva could achieve supreme perfect enlightenment
1233309 good man you should understand these principles in this way when the mind is impartial towards all living beings one can accomplish full and perfect great compassion
1233310 even when the realm of empty space is exhausted the realms of living beings are exhausted the karma of living beings is exhausted and the afflictions of living beings are exhausted i will still accord endlessly continuously in thought after thought without cease
1233311 even when the realm of empty space is exhausted the realms of living beings are exhausted the karma of living beings is exhausted and the afflictions of living beings are exhausted i will still transfer all merits and virtues endlessly continuously in thought after thought without cease
1233312 good man these are the bodhisattva mahasattvas ten great vows in their entirety
1233313 further when a person is on the verge of death at the last instant of life when all his faculties scatter and he departs from his relatives when all power and status are lost and nothing survives when his prime minister great officials his inner court and outer cities his elephants horses carts and treasuries of precious jewels can no longer accompany him these great vows alone will stay with him
1233314 this person will see himself born from a lotus flower and will receive a prediction of buddhahood
1233315 bodhi belongs to living beings without living beings no bocihisattva could achieve supreme perfect enlightenment
1233316 while those involved acknowledged conversations between brett favre and vikings coaches none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1233317 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1233318 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1233319 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1233320 i dont want to be the one the battles always choose
1233321 yo no quiero ser al que las batallas elijan siempre
1233322 its been something that has been there for a while and its just kind of flared up on me
1233323 its something they are looking at and we went and got it looked at again today so well find out tuesday what we need to do with it
1233324 it will keep me out a little bit of time if i have surgery on it but its not going to be substantial
1233325 its not going to go halfway into the season or anything like that it will be maybe a two or three week ordeal and ill be back at it
1233326 its just a circus right now is all it is i dont even pay attention
1233327 i always liken sudden change to when the bell goes off at the fire station
1233328 guys dont roll out of bed and say man i cant believe that
1233329 its just a matter of when gus gets a day off you want to accelerate guys that you usually do not get a chance to see
1233330 he got minimal snaps the other night against kansas city so we just want to see him in some of that situational football it was great for us to be able to evaluate him
1233331 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1233332 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1233333 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1233334 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1233335 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1233336 i was in a personnel meeting with rick spielman and george paton until 11 oclock with the coaches i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other we havent had any contact with them
1233337 ive seen it but havent had a lot of discretionary time to sit and watch television or surf the internet
1233338 i never thought the deal was really something he would consider unless there was just no option to play hes the ultimate competitor and loves to play the game thats all he wanted the whole time
1233339 being around people in management that you dont know if they necessarily want you there its kind of a tough situation
1233340 he was in a no win situation if brett would have stayed retired and never showed up again
1233341 now its even tougher for him i feel for the guy
1233342 i just dont know that aaron has a chance in a competition if he completes every single pass and wins the job when he throws that first interception the crowd is going to do what they do i missed my first field goal my rookie year but i didnt have jan stenerud on the bench
1233343 right now brett is a packer and were preparing to play against brett on monday night football in the sept 8 opener
1233344 anything else is only speculation we might joke about it a little bit because it gets so much media and so much press but were not concerned with it all i wouldnt call it a distraction
1233345 i just have to go out and do my part
1233346 i can only imagine what its going to be like better them than us its going to be a circus out there
1233347 obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans
1233348 they include the amendment with other amendments and dont make it obvious
1233349 can drain assets from pension plans and make them more likely to fail

1233353 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence

1233355 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1233356 it was an american tradition like fathers chasing kids around with power tools
1233357 i think what were seeing on a national basis and it applies locally is donor fatigue
1233358 there are a lot of organizations out there going after charitable dollars and with economic times being what they are people have begun to scale back
1233359 weve made very conservative estimates were being very realistic about what people are going to be able to do
1233360 new hampshire has a huge amount of nonprofits in an economy where i think theres shrinking revenue period
1233361 were all going after these donors and theres only so much to go around
1233362 if people really believe in your mission they will give weve seen that in very bad economic times as well as really good times

1233366 the only families that would have difficulty would be the ones who have poor credit
1233367 well be giving away one prize package every week and we think people will be very impressed with the prizes
1233368 we combined prizes from different businesses to create entire experiences
1233369 one week well be giving away two season tickets for steel beam theatre and a dinner for four at szechwan restaurant worth a total of 350 another week well be giving away a sultan package at mens groom room and a 150 gift certificate for mystique salon and spa a his and hers package of pampering worth about 365 we think people will really enjoy the prizes the businesses are offering
1233370 fortunately the new parking deck is open now so people will have no trouble visiting these businesses shopping dining and filling out their entry forms each and every time they visit any of the participating businesses
1233371 we really hope people take advantage of this exciting promotion
1233372 they should fill out an entry form every time they visit any of the participating businesses and they should be sure to come to all decked out to be a part of the celebration and to see if theyve won the grand prize
1233373 with the soft retail economy its not happening this year

1233376 were trying to be as close as we can on impact fees so we dont have that situation where one community is significantly higher or lower than another
1233377 our officers are keeping more guns off the streets and working harder to reduce those shootings
1233378 of course shot placement and medical advances have helped keep some of the shootings we have had from becoming murders but were working hard to get those numbers down
1233379 our officers are using a lot more computer generated stats to get a better look at the patterns of violence and that helps put them where we need more police presence
1233380 our officers are also making a lot more traffic stops and hopefully theyre getting more warrant arrests as well as traffic violations to keep the bad guys off the streets
1233381 we have meetings every tuesday to discuss our strategies when it comes to preventing violent crimes and the criminal sexual assault is one we spend a lot of time on
1233382 thats a tough one to answer other than that our officers are keeping their eyes open and doing everything they can to be seen in the community
1233383 thats a large increase yet its only eight more and the arson numbers can be deceiving especially since most of these are car fires
1233384 as times get tougher and tougher we see more folks trying to get out from under that payment
1233385 those are the best tools we have to keep aurora a safe place to work and live
1233386 but we cant sit back on these numbers we need to continue to be vigilant
1233387 where we can gain the advantage is if we resolve the problem first
1233388 if you have an employee who spends 22 minutes getting to a meeting youre paying for those 22 minutes
1233389 anything that moves traffic from highways to arterials is not going to work in this region
1233390 the main objective is to better understand the magnitude of the problem and where its occurring
1233391 the region that solves congestion problems first will have the competitive advantage

1233407 the ecb will likely maintain the refinancing rate at 4 25 percent
1233408 despite increasing downside risks to growth ecb president jean claude trichet will probably renew warnings on the central banks commitment to fight second round effects he should stick to the neutral bias mantra
1233409 clearly a further interest rate hike is a real possibility and the ecb is very likely to keep talking tough on inflation
1233410 nevertheless we believe that 4 25 percent will mark the peak in euro zone interest rates although any cut is extremely unlikely to occur until 2009
1233411 we expect markedly weaker euro zone growth softening labor markets extended tight credit conditions and the strong euro to largely contain and then increasingly dilute underlying inflation pressures over the coming months
1233412 the boe should leave the rate at 5 percent this week
1233413 unchanged interest rates seem by far the most probable outcome
1233414 but it is not inconceivable that interest rates could be either raised or cut
1233415 although we would not rule out a cut in november before being cut steadily to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year
1233416 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1233417 we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop

1233419 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1233420 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand

1233430 even if we accept as we should that a great work of literature will have a profundity of meaning beyond the conscious design of the author we still need to see the transcendent beauty through the prism of the personhood of the author pp 177 78 emphasis in original

1233474 what were talking about here is particularly good for brand advertisers
1233475 because we know every blog that exists and what their subject matter is we can go further down the tail
1233476 it all depends on the implementation how it fits into the content the layout and a given sites brand and market positioning
1233477 for blogs that rose as an alternative to traditional media it may be a problem because it creates a far more direct incentive to write about certain subjects for pay
1233478 if the bucks for tagging payoff is large enough some people naturally will change the way they write and what subjects they cover its just human nature
1233479 its a good entr e to invite people into the network
1233480 contextually targeted ads can be significantly more relevant to users and thus more valuable to publishers which we believe will ultimately allow advertisers to target their campaigns more effectively and drive improved conversions and return on spend
1233481 on any of the other exchanges publishers can tell you this is a travel or sports or healthcare page but with clicksense we can tell you if theyre telling the truth
1233482 if we say a page is about healthcare or breast cancer treatment we can back it up with data

1233608 to prepare for the olympics i gave up a lot of things including the opportunity to study in the u s i even suspended having a child although im very sad i have to accept it i have done what an athlete should do
1233609 i dont have a requirement for the number of gold medals more than 20 will be enough for me
1233610 right now olympics news is on tv every day and i am already sick of it
1233611 years ago people didnt have so many distractions and the olympics was a much bigger deal now there is so much information that people pay less attention compared with ordinary people its really the government that cares the most about the medals
1233612 our goal is not just to get gold medals when the olympic games open in beijing its a kind of recognition by the international community of chinas economic and social progress
1233613 it is also a good opportunity to showcase chinas history and cultural heritage
1233614 will be more and more difficult to maintain or to build upon

1233653 weve seen a deterioration in human rights because of the olympics
1233654 specifically weve seen crackdowns on domestic human rights activists media censorship and increased use of re education through labour as a means to clean up beijing and surrounding areas
1233655 the suspension of some events particularly endurance races such as the marathon
1233656 some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related

1233664 but there are residues of prejudice at the unconscious level and they arent difficult to activate if you know how to do it our better angels on race tend to be our conscious rather than our unconscious values and emotions

1233761 i am pleased to see you all my recovery has been very long and painful and it is good to have friendly faces to comfort me
1233762 oh right that no actually we are here because we have a philosophical question that we need settled
1233763 you want me to dole out philosophical wisdom while i am wrapped in bandages and propped up in a hospital bed
1233764 it is not like you would have to move or anything
1233765 all of the depictions of the buddha around the monastery show him as a smiling fat man
1233766 but he gave up all of his worldly possessions and embraced a life of asceticism something does not add up here
1233767 he looks jolly and portly when he should be slender and austere
1233768 i mean we live the same lifestyle as he did and we are all thin
1233769 well maybe you should go out for some exercise once in a while instead of spending all your free time in the basement with your pottery wheel
1233770 you barely ever leave the monastery grounds no wonder we always lose the annual swim meet against master qufus monastery
1233771 if i tell you why the buddha was fat will you stop squabbling amongst yourselves
1233772 laozi had a glandular problem and confucius ate too many carbohydrates but the buddha was simply predisposed to obesity what can i say some people are naturally fat
1233773 if i had a philosophical explanation i would give it to you
1233774 i swear these acolytes will believe anything that you tell them
1233775 is there a zen master with a calligraphy brush inside
1233776 all i ask is that you not pass judgement until you see the machines output
1233777 it is not very deep but one could probably make a theological argument supporting it if nothing else this reflects well on your understanding of the basic principles of buddhist thought
1233778 have you considered leasing your device to the imperial college of dentistry
1233779 acolyte wei got a great one he found it very enlightening
1233780 perhaps acolyte wei should look into a career as a dentist
1233781 one day there will be no masters there will only be computers that dispense wisdom automatically
1233782 and then perhaps we can have automatic students automatically attaining enlightenment and there will be no need to have humans involved at all
1233783 could the buddha create a rock so heavy that even he could not lift it
1233784 i am not stuck i am meditating on the nature of mahjong solitaire
1233785 you should match the bamboo eight in the top left corner with the bamboo eight in the top right corner
1233786 and i have chosen not to take it there are more optimal moves for me to take i am simply determining which is the most optimal
1233787 i do not think you have any other moves master lu
1233788 i will meditate upon this and come up with the correct course of action
1233789 but that is the exact same configuration of tiles i left you with
1233790 now we will see who knows what about probability acolyte ming what are the odds of getting the exact same mahjong deal twice in a row
1233791 it would be exceptionally unlikely the odds are upwards of one in ten to the 249th power
1233792 and yet by your own admission it would not impossible
1233793 perhaps i can contextualize this for you let us say that you pluck a single grain of sand from a rock garden in order to meditate upon it then once you are finished meditating upon it you cast it away and then once it has landed back in the garden you kick the spot where it landed to mess about the sand and then you rake it again meditating upon the nature of the sand and then you close your eyes and pluck another grain of sand completely at random from the garden the odds of you retrieving your initial grain of sand are somewhat comparable to the odds of you dealing out the same mahjong layout twice in a row
1233794 master lu would be much much much more likely to retrieve the grain of sand by several orders of magnitude no less
1233795 yet we are safe in assuming that it will not
1233796 master lu i could deal out hands of mahjong solitaire until the day that i die and i would never again come across that specific configuration of tiles
1233797 are you willing to wager an hour of recreation time on it
1233798 it would seem that we have truly seen who knows what about probability
1233799 yes kindness i remember someone who was very dear to me saying as she had nothing left and only days to live that kindness was the only thing that matters in life and its really true its such a gift
1233800 call you to see how you are mah i thought you can go home tonight

1233817 but when we the gay movement strive to overturn a senseless law will any single one of these stand up and support the proposal
1233818 the draconian ipc section 377 making homosexuality a crime has no bearing on the reality of our times leave alone the times when it was imposed upon an unsuspecting public unsuspecting because the illiterate masses were attuned to following official diktats without a word and those who could understand were too cowardly to raise a voice

1233824 por determinaci n de los compa eros se ha definido salir a las movilizaciones de los 5 000 mineros de huanuni lo que significa que se acata estrictamente la huelga general indefinida con bloqueo de caminos
1233825 los mineros estamos asumiendo esta medida de presi n por el caso omiso que hace el gobierno en el pedido de que se apruebe una nueva ley de pensiones que beneficie a los trabajadores de todo el pa s
1233826 lamentablemente el gobierno sigue con su tozudez porque no hace caso al pedido de los trabajadores considero que el presidente evo morales est rodeado de ministros neoliberales por eso existe una posici n radical de varios de sus ministros ya que no quieren escuchar a los trabajadores
1233827 los bloqueos tenemos que reiniciarlos porque no conf o en el di logo que es para desinflar y desorganizar pero s mantenemos la fuerza para que se cumpla y se ponga en la agenda de la c mara de diputados nuestro proyecto
1233828 hemos esperado por m s de dos a os y no hay nada el gobierno siempre usa el argumento de la conspiraci n de la derecha para desorganizar a los trabajadores para que dejemos de luchar por nuestros derechos
1233829 las reivindicaciones de la cob son leg timas pero ahora le est n haciendo el juego a la derecha si esa dirigencia intenta obligarnos a hacer cosas irracionales esto no lo vamos hacer as nos presionen

1233877 we have been seeing this for awhile via xdoclet and the net community is definitely seeing it i dunno maybe it is just me but it scares me we need to get out some practices for what should be in annotations and really hope specs will not do crazy things which have you nesting them 5 times
1233878 while the advantages of annotating the code jsr 175 metadata facility for java are somewhat clear to me i have been wondering what the drawbacks could be

1233883 can one or even two 55 gallon barrels really make a difference or are they mainly feel good items as one expert suggested to me
1233884 i use the rainwater mostly for potted plants or to water recently transplanted seedlings
1233885 we have two rain barrels which i use to top off my container pond the fish dont have any problem with runoff from my asphalt shingle roof and to fill up a can for whatever hand watering i do the overflow from one rain barrel is directed into a dry stream that flows into a rain garden i love my rain barrels only 65 each from the city of austin and no problems with leaks or cracking however as pointed out above two rain barrels cant hold enough water to get us through the dry summer months id really love to have a cistern one day
1233886 having now emptied one 60 g barrel in order to dry it for re caulking and using the water in the garden as i would normally do i think if i had one more 60 gallon barrel i could go without using any city water during a normal dry season
1233887 to make them more appealing in the landscape we planted bushes around them no one knows they are there unless you are standing right next to them both hold about 100 gallons and i would highly recommend them
1233888 rain barrels are a moot point in my mediterranean climate no real measurable rain fall from late april through late november
1233889 i have five 55 gallon oak rain barrels on our property
1233890 my husband and i built a rain barrel system that holds about 500 gallons weve posted about it a few times it was simple and cheap the whole thing cost under 200 and it provided water all summer we never once had to turn to the well
1233891 rain barrels are just a start i wish i had a cistern like the house i grew up in had
1233892 one problem in austin is that we can go weeks without rain and then get a downpour of 4 inches in an afternoon two rain barrels alone dont provide enough water to see us through the dry spells and they quickly overflow during floods our solution is to eventually get a much larger system
1233893 we have 2 of the aquabarrel rain barrels that are linked together they are great i love em no leaks and best of all the overflow is super huge and we have never had water overflow out the top it takes a 4
1233894 theyre produced by the in toronto hold 132 gallons in the same footprint as the gardeners supply 75 gallon and theyre designed to withstand freezing
1233895 if anyone is interested in purchasing one please let me know we purchased ours through a group buy and saved a lot 190 instead of 250 plus wed like to get another and and know others who want one as well
1233896 a community garden in new york city that used a linked array of 20 55 gallon recycled cooking oil drums raised on a platform
1233897 we recently installed two 60 gallon olive barrels re purposed as rain barrels
1233898 i like the concept i got one at a neighborhood workshop sponsored by some environmental group and im not really happy with it it has all the problems identified in the aquabarrel video
1233899 not sure if this was mentioned in the original post but you can easily
1233900 my advice about rain barrels is to buy them locally with some sort of warranty about quality or at least good word of mouth also look for models that have very few places to leak from
1233901 ready made rain barrels range from 89 to 135 each depending on size style and added features
1233902 my dad who has a greenhouse retail business in the uk used to have a nice little sideline selling used foot container barrels the stuff big quantities of orange juice brined vegetables etc are shipped in as rain barrels dedicated rain barrels being basically the same thing massively overpriced at the time these can often be obtained cheap if you have a food factory of some kind nearby and come in all sizes up to massive
1233903 as to whether fine mesh screen needs to be used the gardeners supply barrel has a
1233904 fine mesh screen should be used to cover any openings in the rain barrel to prevent mosquitoes and to trap debris
1233905 rain barrels can be installed upon blocks or wooden crate to provide height for gravity flow purposes
1233906 as to installing them on blocks or wooden crate to provide height for gravity flow purposes i use my barrels to fill watering cans so its not such an issue for me but if you want to use it with a hose or soaker hose having it higher will create more flow also the spigot needs to be really close to the bottom of the barrel so you can get all the water having it up on something makes it easier to get to both of mine have hose sections attached though for more manouverability
1233907 so you cut off a section in the appropriate height and then put it away to use again when the rain barrel is gone for the winter youll need some sort of a joining piece between the section you cut off and the part still on the house though for one i replaced the entire section with those flexi
1233908 the diverters are excellent and well worth the extra few bucks
1233909 i have disconnected them for the winter so the barrels wont crack with freezing and thawing water inside and i disconnected the s curve input they come with and reinstalled my regular downspout the screen bucket with mine is a cute contraption that allows rain to come into the top directly and keep out detritus and more to the point mosquitoes i think they made a mistake in the winter storage discussion and should have said to reinstall the bucket in the spring and not late fall and i didnt custom cut the downspout i just used the old downspout i can cut off when i installed the s curve pipe to the rain barrel
1233910 i would like to have a rain barrel but to do what id like them to do i would need some sort of filter to clean the water from my asphalt shingle roof i dont think these barrels can be used to help with vegetables and edible plants unless the water from asphalt roofs is cleaned too many chemicals could go into the barrel from the shingles still if youre lucky enough to have a slate or other type of roof i think they would be really helpful i may invest in a stand alone version at some point
1233911 on subject of roof pollution all it takes is 1

1233930 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1233931 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1233932 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1233933 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time

1233935 my friend if i could give you any gift it would be the ability to see yourself the way i see you
1233936 with the world watching we must take advantage of the opportunity provided by the olympic games to recommit ourselves to ending the conflict in darfur and the wider region china in particular as the games host can make a strong statement by joining this call and showing support for the hundreds of thousands of innocent people still at risk in sudan and the region
1233937 the olympic truce like the games themselves is a sage legacy of our forbearers which raises humanity above hostility just as the ancient greek states sought safe passage for their athletes during the olympics the countries of the modern world must seek to protect the life and dignity of the people of darfur as we gather in beijing
1233938 this resolution is an important step towards achieving peace in darfur the olympics are a time when athletes come together in peace and solidarity and the olympic truce period is a time when the international community can come together in peace and solidarity with the u s behind the olympic truce we hope that more countries will join in the efforts to give the people of darfur a chance at lasting peace

1233944 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
1233945 the hypothesis of god offers no worthwhile explanation for anything
1233946 faith is the great cop out the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence
1233947 faith is powerful enough to immunize people against all appeals to pity to forgiveness to decent human feelings
1233948 religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions it is the opium of the people
1233949 bless you all hardship and pain you have cut me off from the death of prosperous idolatry again and again
1233950 i was very afraid to leave their family because i was happy i had a family and i kept holding on to them all the time trying not to lose them
1233951 it was the family that raised me that rescued me i also didnt want to leave poland i thought it was the country that let me live
1233952 but i was 15 years old i was incredibly scared of the bombs i was no hero
1233953 i think of my mother often because she was the dearest person in my life it stays with you all the time what you go through you cant throw it out of your memory
1233954 my husband is very religious and doesnt especially care for the jews
1233955 anytime he tried to say something against the jews i would tell him you forget who i am
1233956 to the one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly his faith is counted as righteousness
1233957 for we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law
1233958 for our sake god made christ to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of god
1233959 rejoice not over me o my enemy when i fall i shall rise when i sit in darkness the lord will be a light to me i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned against him until he pleads my cause and executes judgment for me he will bring me out to the light

1233962 shall the county enact an ordinance to increase real estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic drink tax
1233963 its just as easy to offer to give things away we would love to have free health care for everyone in allegheny county and im sure a ballot measure for that would pass but youve got to pay for things so we have to be realistic
1233964 its unfortunate that fact was required to devote so much time and effort to collect so many signatures
1233965 but it is heartening that tens of thousands of voters were eager to put their name on the dotted line and express their opposition
1233966 were bemused that nine as a non rights holder at so many olympic games all of a sudden cant read or acknowledge what its accreditation allows as a non rights holder
1233967 demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1233968 on balance however it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1233969 inflation is likely to remain relatively high in the short term with the cpi affected by high global oil prices
1233970 looking further ahead inflation in both cpi and underlying terms is likely to decline over time given the outlook for demand provided wages growth remains moderate
1233971 the evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs and lower asset values has restrained demand
1233972 indicators of household spending have continued to record subdued outcomes over recent months and credit expansion to both households and businesses has slowed significantly
1233973 surveys suggest a softening in business activity and there have also been some early signs of an easing in labour market conditions
1233974 i certainly think australian homeowners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank
1233975 we need to look at the future and the long term viability of all the remaining branches in this area especially those in carnglas road in swansea and leonard street in neath
1233976 i would therefore like to appeal to all customers and businesses to support their local branch and make it the first point of call for all business
1233977 they dont seem to have taken into consideration the areas geography and its transport infrastructure and the ability for elderly people and disabled people to get to an alternate branch
1233978 to get from neath abbey to skewen you have to go up a massive hill and they havent taken that into account also theres nowhere to park there if you do drive and it will cost more money for elderly people to get there to pick up their pension which is minimal
1233979 these might be small things to people in government but massive to people on the ground trying to make ends meet
1233980 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1233981 people who dont have anything to hide are usually easy to serve mr oreilly said
1233982 weve spent a lot of time and effort and a lot of long nights dealing with trying to find out where he is
1233983 he is the same major as i was when i was here biochemistry and the same biochemistry professors are still running around up at the academy and they remind me every day that im nothing compared to the student he is and when i watch him on the field im nothing compared to the athlete he is so its pretty humbling
1233984 my role is just to help the team and if my role is catching the ball and going over the middle or whatever routes they want me to run id love it
1233985 you can tell hes getting smarter and smarter about the game

1233997 it is wonderful to see your courage and strength as this is what we are trying to instill in our youth
1233998 it can be such a disappointment when you feel god leading you to start a group and then only one person shows up but from personal experience i can say that god knows what he is doing and may have planned it that way the first time i had only one woman come to a hopekeepers meeting we ended up having an amazing conversation later she disclosed that she was extremely leery about attending and probably wouldnt have spoken at all if other people had been there
1233999 jane i know some of us can identify with what you are sharing can someone else tell us how she or he has dealt with the emotions that accompany a situation that was similar
1234000 since we want to have plenty of time at the end to share something uplifting lets move on to question five jane would it be okay if people could offer their encouragement after the meeting or maybe later this week with a phone call or email
1234001 we are not going to let our president go to any kangaroo court or to be further humiliated everybody in this country needs to understand that

1234017 were introducing a new enemy the imperial japanese army which uses new and different tactics
1234018 and for the first time ever in the call of duty series were introducing co op
1234019 this is the first time the franchise has gone into the pacific theater and the imperial japanese army was a vastly different enemy than the germans in the european theater so we had to design a whole new type of combat and tactics
1234020 the japanese will banzai charge you ambush you climb trees to snipe you and run crawl or climb anywhere imaginable to kill you
1234021 there was a point when we put some great looking japanese character models in a pacific environment with standard call of duty ai and it just didnt work for us

1234023 thats a lot of it you still pay attention to fatigue to matchups but in the middle of august thats when you turn
1234024 im looking for better stuff and obviously to be out there a little longer
1234025 im going to do everything i can for us to win thats my job if thats four innings and 65 pitches or hopefully seven innings and 90 pitches whatever i can do
1234026 then we can get back to doing what we did in april which was closing out a lot of wins
1234027 hes an important guy to our club one of our leaders one of the contributors who adds something to our success
1234028 but for him its just like it is for ludwick joe mather and others its always what you do next what are you going to do for us tonight i dont get too carried away with what weve done
1234029 but i also know that hes doing what its going to take to be prepared when he does come he has a great grasp of what were doing and we want him with his mind totally focused on what we need to do this season when he gets here that days going to be soon ive never put a date on it
1234030 its not a perfect world this is a part of the game and its going to happen to our team again and other teams again
1234031 what youve got to do is figure out a resolution to it there is a resolution we havent come to it but itll be resolved and steven will be a ram for probably the rest of his career
1234032 just drawing like 40 plays the reads the hots all that stuff
1234033 its one thing on paper at home sitting there with your play book open
1234034 its another to come out and verbalize it and then execute it
1234035 at least myself i was it was just getting familiar with the terminology again and remembering your reads
1234036 and then i volunteered to stay even more so it was a lot of time but it was good its helping us now
1234037 the difference is just that everyone has a different personality obviously al and mike are different
1234038 ive learned all my football from mike so i love that al i love him to death i think both their approaches are great and im just glad we have al on our side
1234039 a couple years ago i didnt have to maintain as many things
1234040 but now im at the age where im telling the young guys cold tub treatment i never got it as a younger player but im starting to realize it
1234041 it was a little tougher earlier in my career because there was marshall faulk in the huddle and isaac bruce and torry holt and orlando pace all these guys
1234042 what was i going to do i dont care if im a quarterback or not they were the leaders
1234043 it was tough before when isaac would run a wrong route or something if id say something hed give you the isaac look so i kind of kept my mouth shut
1234044 if its someone that keeps repeating the same mistake i dont have a problem saying something to them
1234045 the level of excitement is at an all time high quarterback chase daniel said
1234046 this is the most excited weve been to come to practice it seems like forever since weve been out here we werent as crisp as we wanted to be on offense but thats to be expected
1234047 we didnt cut anything back we worked hard he said
1234048 we kind of controlled the drills and tried to be smart most of our practices are in the morning today the tempo wasnt quite as quick as normal we just tried to be smart and talk a little more than normal which i dont like but you have to do that
1234049 a lot of the rookies might worry about that and say hey were ranked seventh in the nation but that stuff doesnt matter
1234050 it took a while last year it was a couple of weeks before we found out what we could do but now we already know what were capable of and we know what everyone is saying
1234051 its staggering to me nbc sports chairman dick ebersol said
1234052 the enormity of what were doing just blows me away
1234053 nbc emphasized to the international olympic committee as early as 2001 that having live events in prime time was imperative ebersol who was in beijing recently told television critics meeting in los angeles
1234054 in the first conversation that i had with the new head of the ioc jacques rogge i told him that it would be almost impossible for an american network bidding on the games in the future
1234055 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here so that means were not public television for better of worse gary zenkel president of nbc olympics said
1234056 we have three main constituency groups our affiliates our advertisers and our audience
1234057 we cut back the total number of features and we made the features that will air for the most part shorter neal said
1234058 storytelling is still important the onus of the storytelling now falls on our commentators
1234059 the perception that coverage is weighted too heavily toward americans is a perception that has outrun its truth by several olympics
1234060 are americans somewhat more interested in american performers of course they are but we dont insult the intelligence of the audience theyre interested in any good story wherever it may appear
1234061 the idea is to let bob have some freedom to get out of the studio more often and out to the venues where the big event is for that night neal said
1234062 i felt i had a little bit to do with that
1234063 but most of the time he made me look good
1234064 not many teams are running the fullback anymore so its hard
1234065 but i think its going pretty good im getting a lot of reps
1234066 hes got a pretty good knack for the position and i like his knowledge of what were doing
1234067 glover looks great he had one practice i think about three days ago we couldnt block him
1234068 we gave him the day off just because he was sore and a little tired but hes really turned it on where he can be a heck of a threat
1234069 have him in there on those critical third downs where hes real fresh boy he could do some damage
1234070 skip in rising from the immense shadow of his dad at kmox radio in st
1234071 a lot of these guys today its like theyre getting paid by the word he had a sense of humor never got overly excited he was very steady
1234072 when he was at kmox people said you got the job because of your father
1234073 so moving was a great thing for him because he was on his own completely
1234074 ted and i had been drinking buddies long before he got involved in sports other than the americas cup yachting and it all dovetailed together for me
1234075 things have turned out far better than i ever would have imagined
1234076 superstations beaming across the country and giving caray national exposure
1234077 he was very much his own man which i admired randolph said
1234078 he could have tried to copy his dad but he didnt he was a very talented guy he was an interesting guy deeper than a lot of people knew
1234079 it hurt my feelings and im mad at myself for thinking there was any loyalty left in this business
1234080 to all you people who have watched the braves for these 30 years
1234081 we appreciate you more than you will ever know when we first came on the air on tbs which was then wtcg the big tv shows were m a s h dallas laverne amp shirley happy days and charlies angels we outlasted them all the only one that beat us was 60 minutes

1234084 it wasnt the easy choice it was the hard choice i lost my gi bill my veterans benefits but i did whats right and ive still got my pride
1234085 well you know what i think its come out that you know these people had nothing to do with 9 11 there was no iraqi on those planes we can see around here theres no al qaida theres no terrorist syndicates in baghdad or iraq saddam had stamped em out
1234086 well you know were here to find weapons of mass destruction
1234087 all were trying to do is make it home alive
1234088 in a crowded area if one person shoots at you kill everybody
1234089 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd

1234092 the people of arkansas were exceptionally willing to participate in the democratic process and welcomed our petitioners into their communities from little rock to fayetteville
1234093 any of my opponents about what this country means what makes it great
1234094 kelly im ready to take my collection of self help books off my bookshelf im done with it im psychologically drained from anaylzing everything im ready to get out of my head and get physical
1234095 i read somewhere im not sure where that in order to overcome suffering one must overcome desire
1234096 we had many more teams that wanted to race than we had invitations for
1234097 i dont see any weak spots at all at a time when riders are trying to sign contracts because its the end of the season this is going to be a competitive race
1234098 we are nowhere near being out of the woods for this company but we are on the right trail
1234099 authors self package their book entirely on their own authors distribute digital copies of their books for free to attract readers and to identify a market they use self distribution tools to sell as many books as they can
1234100 we had one intent and that is to build the event
1234101 our performance reflects the growing momentum behind this company after two years of repositioning our brand and reinventing the guest experience
1234102 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us im encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate
1234103 it was so much fun performing my own rap for the competition im looking forward to getting my karaoke machine and singing with my friends
1234104 it took a lot for shauna to do anything like that getting up in front of everyone because i know how shy she gets
1234105 its a great achievement and were so proud of her
1234106 i dont know anything about those reports and even if i did its not something we could comment about
1234107 we would have these regular conversations about how things have changed
1234108 wed talk about how you cant have any fun anymore or theyd ask me if there was someplace they could go where theres not a lot of kids
1234109 it should be ok to ask where you can go to smoke
1234110 where are the really cool places for adults you should be able to ask that
1234111 its stereotypical but not offensive its just fun you can get your picture taken under the giant pedro in the giant sombrero the food is horrible the rides are all half broken down but its something you always remember
1234112 i just want people to read it and have fun
1234113 if they have fun that works for me and well do it some more
1234114 it was so much fun performing my own rap for the competition im looking forward to getting my karaoke machine and singing with my friends
1234115 it took a lot for shauna to do anything like that getting up in front of everyone because i know how shy she gets
1234116 its a great achievement and were so proud of her
1234117 although no one disputes the lengthening of the tail clearly more obscure products are being made available for purchase every day the tail is likely to be extremely flat and populated by titles that are mostly a diversion for consumers whose appetite for true blockbusters continues to grow
1234118 one percent of a million is still 10 000 equal to the entire music inventory of a typical wal mart store
1234119 the concentration of sales around the blockbusters is not as strong as rhapsody but its still substantial
1234120 customers give lower ratings to obscure titles it is a myth that obscure books films and songs are treasured what consumers buy in internet channels is much the same as what they have always bought
1234121 there is no segment with a particular taste for the obscure rather customers with a large capacity for content venture into the tail
1234122 if we just had more platinum records wed make more money
1234123 that it would be imprudent for companies to upend traditional practice and focus on the demand for obscure products
1234124 when producing niche goods for the tail end of the distribution keep costs as low as possible
1234125 strictly manage the costs of offering products that will rarely sell
1234126 do we want infinite choice or do we prefer to pick up on the likes and dislikes of others in forming our own tastes
1234127 cementing the prominence of a small number of cultural favorites
1234128 my findings suggest it would be imprudent for companies to upend traditional practice and focus the demand for obscure products the data shows how difficult it is to profit from the tail
1234129 there is no segment with a particular taste for the obscure
1234130 the whole point of long tail theory is that adding 9 million obscure titles to a digital catalog has negligible marginal costs so any incremental sales would be profitable elberses ill conceived analysis completely missed this point
1234131 how can the investment fixed costs in production and marketing of one of these products ever be covered by such low volumes
1234132 i think of facebook as a middle ground between business and pleasure
1234133 ive attempted to use my facebook presence to promote cool new features on harvardbusiness org to recruit bloggers to solicit new ideas to drive traffic to columns ive written even to connect to my now semi dormant twitter account the result nada

1234142 la destrucci n de los bosques tropicales ha sido siempre la causa principal pero ahora parece que la caza es una amenaza igual de seria en algunas zonas a n donde el h bitat est pr cticamente intacto
1234143 el problema con estas especies es que tienen vidas largas lo que hace que tome tiempo para revertir el descenso es realmente deprimente

1234419 the rise of cooperatives began in 2001 with the special law of cooperative associations
1234420 promoting cooperatives through various mechanisms including education improved access to financial services direct tax exemption and the prioritization of cooperatives in public contracting
1234421 economic growth accelerated in the year 2003 as a result of the implementation of these mechanisms through various state agencies
1234422 this state run program offers both technical education such as classes in agriculture tourism or construction and orientation as to what the bolivarian economic projects are about
1234423 between march 2004 and august 2007 over 670 000 people completed the program resulting in the creation of more than 10 000 cooperatives by its alumni more than 3 000 of which pertain to the agricultural sector
1234424 in diverse fields of human development such as education health culture and nutrition they are a fundamental part of venezuelas policy of redistributing wealth and making basic social services accessible to all citizens studies have found that the social missions contributed to a 9 9 decrease in the poverty rate since 2003
1234425 this new plan aims to educate students about the distinctive socio economic models that have been evolving over time including for example the social production enterprise eps which is model that has developed in venezuela within the last few years
1234426 economic entities dedicated to the production of goods or services in which work has its proper and authentic value with no discrimination associated with any type of work no privileges related to certain positions or hierarchies and with equality between its members based on participative planning
1234427 in practical terms social production enterprises represent an advanced cooperative model where part of profits are invested into community projects
1234428 today there are at least 3 060 social production enterprises in venezuela representing about 30 of the supplier contract value with state enterprises
1234429 has taken a lead role in bringing about the move towards a new socio economic model 10 of the investment volume of every project carried out by pdvsa goes into a social fund that is used for projects in education health infrastructure or the social missions
1234430 is supporting endogenous or inward focused development in venezuela by working hand in hand with the private sector they plan to invest 56 million in 6 large development projects until the year 2013
1234431 pdvsas national contracts were valued at 6 billion of this amount 80 was concentrated in the hands of 148 firms in accordance with the concept of participatory democracy in venezuela pdvsa made it a priority to democratize its supplier base meaning that it opened up to the many small cooperatives prevalent throughout the country this way the state oil company fostered an endogenous model of development that is in line with venezuelas social principals by december 2007 pdvsas supplier network included more than 3 000 social production enterprises
1234432 developed an extensive program around the inclusion of eps having hundreds of people work on the identification of supplier opportunities a standardized eps registration system and an educational program aiming at strengthening social production enterprises and preparing them to do business with pdvsa and other government entities
1234433 pass through three phases of socio economic and technical education receiving up to 760 hours of preparation depending on the sophistication of the service to be provided
1234434 once an eps has a contract with pdvsa it commits itself to contributing about 3 of profits to pdvsas social fund which currently holds millions of dollars being invested in community projects
1234435 today a dream is coming true for us in the past doing business with pdvsa was the privilege of a view large enterprises small companies found closed doors at pdvsa this changed with president ch vez now its the first time that small businesses are given the chance to participate as suppliers and partners of pdvsa contributing in this way to the socio economic development of our country and we are feeling proud of this
1234436 beyond the social production enterprises many other new socio economic concepts have evolved in recent years such as the
1234437 in venezuela nudes are formed when communities discover potential projects linked to a physical space in their surroundings installations factories land and organize in and around this space to carry these projects out for example various cooperatives might join to reactivate the area of an abandoned factory reviving in this way a whole neighborhood and linking the inhabitants of this area to the activities of the nude such as in the case of the nucleus fabricio ojeda
1234438 a huge inventory plant in the neighborhood catia in caracas had been inactive for 12 years until the community decided to turn it into a nude in february 2004 330 persons formed 24 cooperatives for carrying out diverse construction projects in the nucleus and bringing the area back to life today the nucleus is a flourishing and active community center hosting more than 60 cooperatives in various areas and counting on important facilities and services such as health care clinics misi n che guevara sports camps and pharmacies just to name a few today one can find more than 100 nudes in venezuela including more than 950 cooperatives active in various fields and especially in agriculture
1234439 social production networks are formed when a nucleus connects with other nuclei or with cooperatives epss socialist production units or any form of alternative organization to carry out activities for the benefit of the community
1234440 are companies run by the government and marked by extensive community involvement upss are found predominantly in the agricultural sector and they promote national agricultural sovereignty part of the profits of these companies is invested into community projects which are identified jointly with local community leaders in the long term upss will ideally be handed over directly to the community and run as community enterprises

1234444 in order to strengthen regional economies and make them less vulnerable to financial crisis the government of venezuela has actively supported the rise of barter system and the creation of communal currencies throughout venezuela currently about 4 000 people practice bartering in 6 different regions in venezuela yaracuy falc n sucre nueva esparta margarita barinas trujillo each has its own local currency agricultural products are mainly available for barter trade and the practice fosters local agriculture

1234446 are the financial arm of the communal councils they are constituted as cooperatives and administered democratically by five persons elected to the citizens assembly which is the highest decision making body of the communal councils communal banks facilitate the flow of resources toward community development projects
1234447 according to the ministry of popular power for participation and social development there were 19 500 communal councils in venezuela by march 2007 and the majority of them received funding from various ministries and state institutions
1234448 by march 2008 the ministry of popular power for the communal economy alone has approved more than 400 million to be handed over to 2 540 communal banks for productive projects 1 533 of these banks have already received the whole amount assigned to them and another 833 received part of the amount with this money 21 277 micro credits were allotted to cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs most is used for projects in the service industry or in commerce or agriculture
1234449 by the end of this year fondemi the microfinance development fund plans to finance 3 000 more communal banks distributing yet another 420 million for productive projects

1234487 barclays own figures show that the greatest increase in borrowing has been on arable farms higher returns from the 2007 crop encouraged many farmers to replace out dated and ageing machinery and the cost of financing these assets has added significantly to the cash requirements on arable farms
1234488 lending figures also reflect two other key inflationary trends that farming businesses have experienced during the first half of this year farming inputs and fertiliser prices in particular have increased dramatically in recent months not only have prices risen sharply but altered terms of trade mean that inputs have to be ordered and paid for earlier than usual
1234489 the sterling exchange rate against the euro has had a positive impact on farming as our exports have become more competitive and imported commodities have become more expensive
1234490 whilst the latest farm borrowing statistics are significant the uk farming balance sheet remains exceptionally robust and most farms are well able to service their debts despite concerns that some have about the potential impact of current financial market conditions the figures also clearly demonstrate that lenders are still providing finance for the sector barclays remains very much open for business and we are providing strong support for our customers whether they are looking to finance additional working capital or to expand their farms by buying more land

1234493 there is an embittered gang of ex ministers and junior ministers we know who they are but we cannot prove so far that they are about to resign as a group gordon wants the names so he can move against the lot of them
1234494 we suspect they are junior ministers and ministerial aides it is unhelpful for the labour party gordon or the government to speculate publicly about who they are it does not help us at all but we have been looking for them
1234495 we are a million miles from that it is simply not going to happen like that and why would he go
1234496 even as we keep working globally we need to do much more to fight aids at home and i intend to do so with my foundation

1234504 refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful uighurs
1234505 we condemn all acts of violence the uyghur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1234506 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1234507 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the olympics greatly

1234510 a new cultural climate is developing and taking hold which gives rise to crimes against life broad sectors of public opinion justify certain crimes against life in the name of the rights of individual freedom and on this basis they claim not only exemption from punishment but even authorization by the state so that these things can be done with total freedom and indeed with the free assistance of health care systems
1234511 it is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish
1234512 i feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion because it is a war against the child a direct killing of the innocent child murder by the mother herself and if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child how can we tell other people not to kill one another

1234516 the length and depth of that is uncertain i think if a recession occurred it could be shallow but any meaningful recovery in the housing market is unlikely before next year employment is fragile these are difficult conditions and they will remain difficult into next year too
1234517 i dont think emerging markets have completely decoupled from europe north america or japan there has been an element of decoupling there is an increasing amount of exports to other destinations there will be an impact from a us recession there is no question
1234518 the near term outlook remains negative with a significant degree of uncertainty there is pressure on a number of emerging markets in terms of inflation
1234519 north america continues to disappoint we warned in late 2006 that we saw the consumer market weakening and regrettably we havent been proved wrong

1234528 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1234529 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1234530 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1234531 we were living one of the great love stories i think of the 20th century and we didnt know it nobody told us it occurred to us from observation and reasoning that extramarital sex was not what really destroyed marriages but rather the lies and deception that invariably accompanied it that was the culprit so we decided to give ourselves permission to sleep with other partners if we wished as long as what we did was honest as well as private and that neither of us exposed the family to scandal or disease we had to be discreet and if the word can be apt honorable in our behavior both to ourselves to whomever else might be involved and most of all to the family and for the most part we were but looking back id say no matter what did or did not happen we freed each other and in doing that we also freed ourselves sex is fine but love is better thats the most important part of being free in light of what we learned is extramarital sex something we recommend as a regular part of marriage not now not anymore not since aids has entered the equation and genital herpes syphilis and other veneral diseases
1234532 fifty two years being married theres been a lot of overcoming theres been a lot of struggle there but marriage is everyday you think you love somebody but love is an aspiration marriage is more than putting up with each other its a growing up together coming into maturity and seniorhood together its been a journey a profound learning experience about each other about men about women ossie is a very sensitive person i came from a background i considered to be a very chauvinistic women of the house did all the work even in poor neighborhoods i call my self lucky in terms of marrying a man who had a great sensitivity and intelligence and who realized that the equations were lopsided its ossie that taught me about womens equality he said ruby youve got a brain love i think is one of the most difficult equations that humanity is faced with love thy neighbor as thyself well whoever wrote that dont know some of these neighbors god put down here huh i have this spiritual argument with myself but i think were put down here to explore to understand and to practice love whatever it is that is called love that has kept us together and we almost know what that is after 50 years we almost know what love is ossie wanting an open marriage was part of our 52 years that period there i dont know i guess all couples go through some period of disenchantment or believing that the grass is greener and it may not be crab grass on the other side it may be beautiful but you come to the conclusion that its one of these elements in life where you decide if what you have is really is what you want the complications of being involved with other human beings and the world is full of marvelous human beings you could find one maybe every week or every year or something and it would be such a topsy turvy affair in terms of family property and all kind of things but we both came to realize that we were very fortunate that in all of the deep profound fundamental ways we really really only wanted each other it was like a rediscovery of something from the beginning its not something that youd recommend to everybody but often ossie has said and ive though too the best way to have somebody is to let it go if it doesnt come back you are free in another kind of sense in that you find the strength to let go and wish somebody well so we thought an open marriage was appropriate for us but it turned out not to be but then thats what were all about we are moving from one position to another in the process of trying to unravel this thing call life
1234533 as long as what we did was honest as well as private and that neither of us exposed the family to scandal or disease

1234559 volver a newells es lo mejor que podr a haberme pasado sab a que alg n d a iba a dirigir a este club pero nunca imagin que ser a tan r pido a la gente le digo que llega un cuerpo t cnico que sabe muy bien la responsabilidad que tiene y que est muy influenciado con la historia de esta instituci n
1234560 la gente se encontrar con un t cnico convencido de las decisiones que tome mi idea t ctica est bien definida me gusta jugar con l nea de tres atr s porque nadie te ataca con m s de dos delanteros tambi n me da m s seguridad porque ten s a dos tipos encargados de la marca y el otro sobra soy amante de los enganches aunque en el f tbol argentino no hay muchos jugadores que puedan desempe arse naturalmente en esa posici n tambi n pod s poner a un jugador con buen manejo adelante del cinco cl sico y que no sea necesariamente un enganche quiero a un equipo que ataque siempre con obligaciones defensivas y que se sienta seguro de s mismo
1234561 tengo un plantel muy rico en capacidad y cantidad de jugadores hay gente que jug y sali campe n en clubes muy importantes mi aspiraci n es poner a newells en el lugar donde merece estar
1234562 habl con el presidente eduardo l pez pero hasta ahora no le ped a ning n jugador
1234563 ser a un grave error de mi parte arrancar este proceso sin apoyarme en los jugadores m s experimentados es una obligaci n del entrenador hablar con ellos porque es la gente que te va a contar cu l es la realidad del grupo qu es lo que est pasando qu necesita el plantel d nde nos estamos equivocando
1234564 es un delantero muy importante y que llega con competencia eso es una ventaja porque puedo contar con l ya mismo
1234565 sent que hab a muchas expectativas mucho control en la previa ten a la preocupaci n de patear pero hice movimientos de giro y me sent muy bien estoy muy contento y espero seguir as para poder llegar al partido del s bado con estudiantes

1234567 tengo en claro que me falta ritmo futbol stico y eso se agarra jugando si juego el s bado espero que no se me note y que pueda estar a la altura de un partido que va a ser muy complicado s que puedo suplir la falta de ritmo con otras cosas

1234570 hay un hilo conductor el compromiso y las ideas porque todas las luchas que se han dado en am rica y el mundo han sido lucha de ideas
1234571 son ideas que cada uno de nosotros tenemos sobre el pa s que queremos vivir una sociedad m s solidaria m s justa
1234572 esos que crecen y no ven que es necesario dar un poquito de ese crecimiento a los que solitos no pueden salir de la miseria

1234576 its not a clear yes or no instead its somewhere in between generally vendors deliver on their promises such as the original scope of the product or service being taken care of its a no when it comes to long term satisfaction with the product or service
1234577 its critical that the vendors concentrate on fulfilling the customers needs beyond the understanding stated on agreements and furthermore venture into ensuring that the customers interests are safeguarded in the process
1234578 we learnt very quickly that it was important to include a statement of work into every purchase we make it contains the details of what we expect the service conditions and the penalty conditions should the expectations not be met
1234579 a helpful spin off of the statement of work has been that it has scared off stray bidders and so we only deal with people capable of delivering quality service
1234580 i do not think the service tiers are mature the rta follows information technology infrastructure library itil standards but i find that most vendors do not have a very well defined system of tiers and even fewer meet the itil standards we work on establishing a relationship with our vendors so if something is not working i make a call and it gets seen to
1234581 while the structuring of the tiers may be acceptable how efficient and effective the tier selection is depends on the actual delivery of services to the customers
1234582 from my viewpoint a big issue for vendors is that they have limited manpower this means that they are not able to address issues as per the time frame that is guaranteed in the support contract they simply need to employ more people
1234583 vendors should invest more in research and development while expanding on the customer satisfaction strategy they should also not go below a certain price because often times they are then forced to compromise on the deliverables
1234584 first i would suggest vendors implement a back end process in order that they can differentiate between what is a tier one problem what is tier two and so on second i would suggest that they have a proper escalation method independent of the technical managers reports should be made to the marketing manager or accounts manager so that they know that the end users are getting the required service from the technical team
1234585 i feel that if vendors want to improve they need to look at providing preventive maintenance conduct proactive quarterly visits and free training for upgrades these steps would go a long way in keeping the users happy
1234586 location is my problem being based in qatar limits my options when it comes to suppliers making sure i get the service i require from vendors comes down to personally negotiating with them to ensure that they know what i want

1234622 those from the american south liked the detached homes and spacious lawns during the prosperity of the eisenhower years they put down deposits in st albans laurelton springfield gardens cambria heights sometimes as in hollis this precipitated white flight but queens was receptive and blacks were able to buy houses at reasonable prices then they kept on buying

1234683 a vis o do homem agora cansa o que hoje o niilismo se n o isto
1234684 n o poderia haver felicidade jovialidade esperan a orgulho presente sem o esquecimento
1234685 com ajuda da moralidade do costume e da camisa de for a social o homem foi realmente tornado confi vel
1234686 quanto sangue e quanto horror h no fundo de todas as coisas boas
1234687 a moral n o passa de uma interpreta o ou mais exactamente de uma falsa interpreta o de certos fen menos

1234689 n o uma quest o fr vola perguntar se plat o caso tivesse permanecido indiferente ao fasc nio socr tico n o teria encontrado um tipo mais elevado de humanidade filos fica tipo que para n s se perdeu para sempre
1234690 as mulheres podem se tornar facilmente amigas de um homem mas para manter essa amizade torna se indispens vel o concurso de uma pequena antipatia f sica
1234691 qual amarra mais firme quais as cordas que s o quase imposs veis de romper entre os homens de uma qualidade elevada e seleta ser o os deveres esse respeito como conv m juventude essa timidez e delicadeza diante de tudo o que venerado h muito e digno o reconhecimento pelo solo em que cresceu pela m o que guiou pelo santu rio em que aprendeu a orar
1234692 o tr gico na vida de grandes homens est freq entemente n o no seu conflito com a poca e a baixeza de seus semalhantes mas na sua incapacidade de adiar por um ou dois anos a sua obra
1234693 o hip crita que representa sempre o mesmo papel deixa enfim de ser hip crita
1234694 toda moral admite a es intencionalmente prejudiciais em caso de legitima defesa
1234695 tudo evolui n o h realidades eternas tal como n o h verdades absolutas
1234696 a gente s bria e industriosa em que a religi o est bordada como um laurel da humanidade superior essa gente faz muito bem em continuar religiosa isso a embeleza todos os homens que n o entendem o of cio das armas incluindo entre as armas a boca e a caneta tornam se servis para esses a religi o crist muito til pois o servilismo toma ent o o aspecto de uma virtude crist e fica estonteantemente embelezado pessoas para quem sua vida cotidiana parece demasiado vazia e mon tona tornam se facilmente religiosas isto compreens vel e perdo vel
1234697 se o cristianismo tivesse raz o com suas teses do deus vingador da propens o universal ao pecado da predestina o pela gra a e do perigo de uma condena o eterna seria um sinal de fraqueza de esp rito e falta de car ter n o se fazer padre ap stolo ou mission rio e n o trabalhar com o temor e tremor exclusivamente para sua pr pria salva o seria absurdo perder assim de vista a vantagem eterna em troca da comodidade tempor ria supondo que tenha f o crist o de todos os dias uma figura lament vel um homem que realmente n o sabe contar at tr s e que de resto justamente por causa de sua incapacidade mental de calcular n o mereceria ser castigado t o duramente como lhe promete o cristianismo
1234698 enquanto um indiv duo reconhecer os pontos fortes e fracos de sua teoria de sua arte de sua religi o sua for a ainda escassa o disc pulo e o ap stolo que n o tem olhos para a fraqueza da teoria da religi o e assim por diante ofuscado pelo prest gio de seu mestre e por sua devo o para com ele tem por isso habitualmente mais poder que o mestre sem os disc pulos cegos a influ ncia de um homem e de sua obra nunca conseguiu ainda se difundir muitas vezes ajudar no triunfo de uma id ia significa apenas associ la t o fraternalmente com a estupidez que o peso da ltima se torna tamb m obrigat ria a vit ria da primeira

1234700 todo h bito tece em torno de n s uma teia sempre mais s lida de fios de aranha e logo percebemos que os fios se tornaram lagos e que n s mesmos ocupamos o centro como uma aranha que se prendeu a si e que deve viver de seu pr prio sangue por isso que o esp rito livre odeia todos os h bitos e regras todo o duradouro o definitivo por isso que recome a sempre com dor a romper em torno dele a teia embora deva sofrer em conseq ncia de muitos ferimentos pequenos e grandes pois dele pr prio de seu corpo de sua alma que deve arrancar esses fios deve aprender a amar onde odiava e vice versa n o deve at mesmo ser imposs vel para ele semear os dentes do drag o no campo onde recentemente fazia correr os chifres da abund ncia disso se pode concluir se ele feito para a felicidade do casamento
1234701 viver perto demais de um homem a mesma coisa que retom ssemos sempre uma bela gravura com os dedos nus um belo dia teremos nas m os um p ssimo papel sujo e nada mais a alma de um homem se desgasta tamb m por um contato cont nuo pelo menos o que nos acaba por parecer nunca mais haveremos de rever sua figura e suas belezas originais sempre se perde no relacionamento demasiadamente ntimo com mulheres e amigos e nisso se perde s vezes a p rola da pr pria vida
1234702 o esp rito livre respirar sempre desde que finalmente se resolver a sacudir essa solicitude e essa vigil ncia maternas com as quais as mulheres o cercam o que n o pode causar uma corrente de um ar um pouco rude que era afastada t o ansiosamente dele o que significa uma vantagem real uma perda um acidente uma doen a uma d vida uma sedu o a mais ou a menos em sua vida comparados com a falta de liberdade do ber o de ouro dessa exibi o pav o de cauda aberta e do sentimento penoso de dever ainda ser grato para ser vigiado e mimado como uma crian a de peito por isso que o leite que a solicitude maternal das mulheres de seu meio lhe d o pode t o facilmente se transformar em fel
1234703 os esp ritos livres viver o com mulheres em geral acredito que como os p ssaros ver dicos da antiguidade sendo aqueles que pensam e dizer a verdade do presente preferir o voar sozinhos
1234704 s crates encontrou uma mulher de que realmente precisava mas ele pr prio n o a teria procurado nunca se a tivesse conhecido bastante o hero smo desse esp rito livre n o teria ido de qualquer forma t o longe o fato que xantipa o impeliu sempre mais em sua miss o pessoal tornando lhe a casa e o lar inabit veis e inospitaleiros ela ensinou a viver nas ruas e em toda parte onde se pudesse conversar e ficar na ociosidade e fez dele o maior dial tico das ruas de atenas ele teve finalmente de se comparar com um cabresto que um deus havia colocado no belo cavalo antenas para n o deix lo jamais em paz
1234705 uma convic o a cren a de estar num ponto qualquer do conhecimento de posse da verdade absoluta
1234706 as convic es s o inimigas da verdade mais perigosas que a mentira
1234707 vivemos num tempo em que civiliza o periga morrer por meio da civiliza o
1234708 ningu m mais morre hoje de verdades mortais h ant dotos em demasia
1234709 a exig ncia de ser amado a maior das pretens es
1234710 um mant m sua opini o porque imagina que chegou a ela por si mesmo o outro porque a aprendeu com dificuldade e est orgulhoso por ter conseguido compreend la ambos em decorr ncia por vaidade
1234711 s cabe aos que me reprovam refletir um pouco e depois pedir desculpas a si mesmos n o preciso de uma palavra para a minha defesa
1234712 o homem perde o poder quando contagiado pelo sentimento de piedade
1234713 a humanidade aprendeu a chamar a piedade de virtude quando em todo o sistema moral superior ela considerada como uma fraqueza
1234714 o cristianismo tomou o partido de tudo o que fraco baixo incapaz e transformou em um ideal a oposi o aos instintos de conserva o da vida saud vel e at corrompeu a faculdade daquelas naturezas intelectualmente poderosas ensinando que os valores superiores do intelecto n o passam de pecados desvios tenta es o mais lament vel exemplo a concep o de pascal que julgava estar a sua raz o corrompida pelo pecado original estava corrompida sim mas apenas pelo seu cristianismo
1234715 a piedade op e se completamente lei da evolu o lei da sele o natural
1234716 para suportar a minha seriedade e a minha paix o preciso ser ntegro nas coisas de esp rito at as ltimas conseq ncias estar acostumado a viver nas montanhas a ver abaixo de si o mesquinho charlatanismo actual da pol tica e do ego smo dos povos e finalmente ter se tornado indiferente e jamais perguntar se a verdade til se chegar a ser uma fatalidade necess ria tamb m uma inclina o para enfrentar quest es que hoje ningu m se atreve a elucidar inclina o para o proibido predestina o para o labirinto
1234717 a desigualdade dos direitos a primeira condi o para que haja direitos
1234718 a maturidade do homem consiste em haver reencontrado a seriedade que tinha nas brincadeiras de quando era crian a
1234719 falar muito de s mesmo pode ser um jeito de esconder aquilo que realmente
1234720 algu m procura um parteiro para as suas id ias um outro algu m que possa ajudar e apartir da nasce uma boa conversa
1234721 os homens trataram at agora as mulheres como p ssaros que vindos das alturas perderam se e vieram refugiar se ao p deles enfim como algo de mais delicado mais vulner vel mais selvagem mais esquisito mais doce com mais alma mas algo que se deve engaiolar para que n o fuja
1234722 um fil sofo um homem que experimenta v ouve suspeita espera e sonha constantemente coisas extraordin rias
1234723 o cinismo a nica forma sob a qual as almas vulgares se aproximam do que seja a honestidade e o homem superior ter os ouvidos atentos para todo o cinismo grosseiro ou sutil e se felicitar toda vez que um buf o sem pudor ou s tiro da ci ncia prosear diante dele
1234724 o homem indignado ou quem est sempre dilacerando e rasgando a si mesmo ou em seu lugar o mundo deus a sociedade com os pr prios dentes pode ser moralmente superior ao s tiro sorridente e satisfeito mas em qualquer outro sentido ele o caso mais comum mais irrelevante menos instrutivo e ningu m mente tanto quanto o indignado
1234725 independ ncia algo para bem poucos prerrogativa dos fortes e quem procura ser independente sem ter a obriga o disso ainda que com todo o direito demostra que provavelmente n o apenas forte mas temer rio al m de qualquer medida ele penetra num labirinto multiplica mil vezes os perigos que o viver j traz consigo dos quais um dos maiores que ningu m pode ver como e onde de extravia se isola e despeda ado por algum minotauro da consci ncia supondo que algu m assim desapare a isto ocorre t o longe do entendimento dos homens que eles n o sentem nem compadecem e ele n o pode voltar j n o pode retornar sequer para a compaix o dos homens
1234726 existem alturas da alma de onde mesmo a trag dia deixa de ser tr gica
1234727 os sexos se enganam um a respeito do outro no fundo cada um deles ama e honra apenas a si mesmo ou o seu ideal para diz lo de modo mais agrad vel assim o homem quer a mulher tranq ila mas a mulher como o gato essencialmente intranq ila por mais que tenha aprendido a dar se uma apar ncia de paz
1234728 na vingan a e no amor a mulher mais b rbara que o homem
1234729 quem combate monstruosidades deve cuidar para que n o se torne um monstro e se voc olhar longamente para um abismo o abismo tamb m olha para dentro de voc
1234730 ainda hoje na in cua interpreta o crist moralista que relaciona os eventos pessoais gl ria de deus
1234731 a diversidade dos homens se mostra n o apenas na diversidade das suas t buas de bens isto no fato de quedos bem diversos como desej veis e que estejam em desacordo quanto ao valor maior ou menor quanto hierarquia dos bens reconhecidos por todos ela se mostra mais ainda no que consideram que ter e possuir verdadeiramente um bem
1234732 os pais fazem dos filhos involuntariamente algo semelhante a eles a isso denominam
1234733 e assim como o pai tamb m a classe o padre o professor o pr ncipe continuam vendo em toda a nova criatura a c moda oportunidade de uma nova posse
1234734 o ceticismo a mais espiritual express o de uma complexa constitui o fisiol gica que na linguagem corrente chamam de neurastenia e debilidade ele surge todas vez que se cruzam de modo s bito e decisivo ra as por longo tempo separadas a nova gera o como que herda no sangue medidas e valores diversos nela tudo inquietude perturba o tentativa d vida as melhores for as inibem as pr prias virtudes n o permitem uma outra crescer e se fortalecer no corpo e na alma faltam equil brio gravidade seguran a perpendicular
1234735 o que se faz por amor sempre acontece al m do bem e do mal
1234736 a loucura algo raro em indiv duos mas em grupos partidos povos e pocas a norma
1234737 abandono muitas coisas deixo as correr ao acaso e por isso dizeis que sou desdenhoso quando se bebe em copos muito cheios deixa se cair muita bebida nem por isso continueis a considerar o vinho pior
1234738 spero e suave grosseiro e fino familiar e estranho impuro e puro lugar de encontro dos loucos e dos s bios tudo isso sou tudo isso quero ser ao mesmo tempo pomba serpente e porco
1234739 n o suporto almas estreitas n o t m nada de bom tampouco nada de mau
1234740 n o te enchas de ar a menor picadela te esvaziaria
1234741 odeio seguir algu m como tamb m conduzir obedecer n o e governar nunca quem n o se mete medo n o consegue met lo a ningu m somente aquele que o inspira capaz de comandar j detesto comandar a mim mesmo gosto como os animais das florestas e dos mares de me perder durante um tempo permanecer a sonhar num recanto encantador e for ar me a regressar de longe ao meu lar atrair me a mim pr prio de volta para mim

1234746 o homem uma corda esticada entre o animal e o super homem uma corda por cima do abismo
1234747 preciso ter um caos dentro de si para dar luz uma estrela cintilante
1234748 os aforismos devem ser cumeeiras e aqueles a quem se fala devem ser homens altos e robustos

1234770 o homem do conhecimento n o s deve poder amar seus inimigos deve tamb m poder odiar seus amigos
1234771 o homem n o vive para o prazer apenas o ingl s
1234772 o esfor o dos fil sofos tende a compreender o que os contempor neos se contentam em viver
1234773 o homem procura um princ pio em nome do qual possa desprezar o homem inventa outro mundo para poder caluniar e sujar este de facto s capta o nada e faz desse nada um deus uma verdade chamados a julgar e condenar esta exist ncia

1234784 quando o reconhecimento de muitos por um nico afasta qualquer pudor nasce assim a fama
1234785 entre os ricos a liberdade uma esp cie de timidez
1234786 odeio as almas estreitas sem b lsamo e sem veneno feitas sem nada de bondade e sem nada de maldade
1234787 a vaidade alheia s nos antip tica quando vai de encontro a nossa
1234788 nunca odiamos aos que desprezamos odiamos aos que nos parecem iguais ou superiores a n s
1234789 as explica es m sticas s o consideradas profundas na verdade falta lhes ainda muito para que sejam superficiais

1234795 o riso um prazer com a mis ria alheia mas que se toma com uma boa consci ncia

1234813 voc diz que acredita na necessidade da religi o seja sincero voc acredita mesmo na necessidade da pol tica
1234814 o puro esp rito uma pura estupidez retire o sistema nervoso e os sentidos o chamado envolt rio mortal e o resto um erro de c lculo isso tudo
1234815 enquanto o padre esse negador caluniador e envenenador da vida por profiss o for aceito como uma variedade de homem superior n o poder haver resposta pergunta que a verdade a verdade j foi posta de cabe a para baixo quando o advogado do nada foi confundido com o representante da verdade

1234845 they told her that the best thing she could do for al qaeda was to start popping out little jihadists
1234846 she was furious she knows more about this stuff than pretty much anyone in the organization
1234847 in the area where she was sequestered they put their weapons down while trying to talk to her and she seized a weapon and began to shoot
1234848 our officer returned fire she was shot in the stomach but continued to struggle
1234849 we thought she was dead until her brother in houston got a visit from the fbi the other day and said she is alive
1234850 white earth lost all but 800 and some acres of land out of over 850 000 acres of original land on the reservation
1234851 our land here was swindled or stolen or taken away illegally
1234852 to do any less than a per capita distribution would be a second injustice to white earth
1234853 we are 52 percent of the minnesota chippewa tribe and we only have two votes on the tribal executive committee with the other five tribes with two votes each as well that in itself is not one person one vote representation
1234854 the basis for that belief is that the tribe settled the nelson act claims based on the notion that each of the bands would participate equally in the burden as well as in the reward
1234855 if you have two senior members like us on opposite sides the reaction around here is to do nothing you know
1234856 so unless this gets worked out somehow or another i think were just going to be in limbo here
1234857 its not helpful for us to be divided by money thats not our normal inclination from 100 years ago
1234858 i would like to think theres a remedy and my believe has always been the same reasonable people equally informed seldom disagree but you know youre talking about 27 million

1234863 a deep spirituality centered in bible study worship and prayer
1234864 is more about the christian way of life than it is about a rigid and polemicized systems of belief
1234865 once you throw off biblical doctrine what do you have to guide you this is to me a reflection of what satan did with eve in the garden this is genesis 3 1 yea hath god said in other words if you undermine what god had said then what have you got
1234866 well youve got proverbs 14 12 theres a way that seems right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death or destruction

1234870 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1234871 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1234872 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1234873 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1234874 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1234875 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1234876 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man

1234879 hoy estamos dando un paso cualitativo en la lucha contra la nefasta ley del issste y contra la aplicaci n del pacto firmado por elba esther gordillo y felipe calder n la alianza por la calidad de la educaci n y creemos que ha llegado el momento de aplicar nuevas estrategias y no frenar los mecanismos que nos garanticen la abrogaci n total de la ley y de la alianza
1234880 concretamos un paso m s para enfrentar la avanzada privatizadora sobre pemex y la creciente militarizaci n del pa s lo que demanda la preparaci n de un paro nacional tarea a la que regresaremos en todas las regiones donde hay presencia de la cnte
1234881 se analiz levantar el plantonissste para dar paso a nuevas estrategias que nos permitan dar pasos cualitativos sin dejar de tener como eje central la abrogaci n total de su criminal ley pero al mismo tiempo ser capaces de enfrentar otro atentado como el que pretenden aplicar con su alianza
1234882 nunca en los 65 a os de existencia del snte hab a sido tan denigrante el papel de gente como elba esther gordillo quien pretende atribuirse el derecho exclusivo de definir el final del mismo gremio y la desaparici n total de los derechos de los trabajadores
1234883 no ha sido ratificada como presidenta del snte y que est violando los propios estatutos que aprob en complicidad con el gobierno federal por lo que se encuentra fuera de cualquier norma estatutaria vigente y no cuenta con la representatividad del magisterio
1234884 rechazan su nefasta ley del issste su alianza perversa y la privatizaci n de pemex vamos con todo a preparar la huelga nacional para frenar cualquier intento de lesionar los derechos del pueblo de m xico

1234887 the older i get the smarter i get realizing how stupid i really am
1234888 the best people working for organizations are like volunteers since they could probably find good jobs in any number of groups they choose to work somewhere for reasons less tangible than salary or position
1234889 these are the results after interviewing or using this survey for hundreds of thousands of workers
1234890 just increase our knowledge base or pursue an area of interest
1234891 treat all workers as if the are volunteers because they are
1234892 i have 1000 i can afford this ill have time to save up again
1234893 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1234894 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1234895 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1234896 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1234897 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live
1234898 we do not believe that this was a random attack
1234899 we think that this was deliberate action perpetrated against him for a reason but a motive is still a little bit unclear
1234900 you usually hear noise back and forth and kids walking through you know young adults and stuff but nothing
1234901 i think that the trends were seeing show that there are people in oakland who are lacking hope who dont see a way out for their lives other than to commit some crimes
1234902 i think definitely theres a relationship between the situation with the economy especially in places like oakland that have very serious levels of unemployment and the incidence of crime i dont think theres any question about that
1234903 theyre just a bunch of stupid lazy expletive that wont go get a job
1234904 but i dont know how to reuse a toilet paper tube
1234905 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1234906 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1234907 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1234908 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1234909 baby im not asking you to suck my dick im just asking you to hold it a little
1234910 i have the materials and equipment i need to do my job

1234912 encryption is widely used to prevent unauthorized access to data and information systems and digital ip against piracy and theft
1234913 however one critical point of failure in such systems is the instance at which the key is revealed and used this point is identifiable through signature patterns and cryptographic routines once found they direct an attacker straight to where the keys will typically be constructed in memory subsequently fatal exploits can be created and used
1234914 were pleased to bring the latest in key hiding and protection technology to the market with transformit in response to market demand for stronger information security
1234915 in conjunction with our guardit family of products transformit enhances our proven ability to protect and harden applications against the growing range of attack vectors arxan security solutions now provide protection against key exploits that can result in system wide compromise and data leakage
1234916 a blog i would drag kicking and screaming into prominence if i could
1234917 i just come here when i need to shout at my monitor for a while
1234918 one finger on the pulse of the enemy another on the trigger
1234919 the world wont end with a bang itll end with a twitter
1234920 the difficulties right now are very deep and im hoping we can get past them
1234921 a tax increase will worsen an already languishing economy housing values are plummeting jobs are at risk and everything costs more for the average californian
1234922 i cannot envision any republican legislator supporting such a proposal
1234923 its not our idea so its up to the governor
1234924 you will get pushback no matter what you do because its a crisis situation
1234925 some people will push back if you use the lottery and other people will push back if we do the borrowing and other people will push back big time if you raise taxes
1234926 we fundamentally do not believe in taxes and wont go there
1234927 weve not seen any language that would indicate they are serious about budget reform
1234928 with significant budget reform with that i think everything needs to be on the table
1234929 for a situation that will be resolved in the next two or three weeks
1234930 im not married not yet 30 and or i have no kids is any of this prosper thing going to apply to me

1234942 ok as you like the manager will be with you soon you can take a seat wherever you like
1234943 what am i going to have to score on this
1234944 if you score 130 that means youre a genius but anything over 110 is very good
1234945 124 you have a lot of questions just score over 110 and you have a chance you can always take it over again if you get lower
1234946 we are looking at countries like bangladesh nepal india and maldives this year we should probably be in bangladesh
1234947 we are looking at a fully fledged company in bangladesh maybe with the same standards as in sri lanka with more than 500 million rupees investment
1234948 we have got more than 40 percent growth rate year on year and we have moved from conventional printing to data printing data printing is very new to sri lanka
1234949 severe drought in australia coupled with the removal of subsidies for milk in europe have made prices in the world market go up
1234950 but the root of the problem dates back to the iraq conflict when excess stocks were sent as aid
1234951 lots of excess milk was also sent as aid during the tsunami this ran down stocks later europe took off the 250 us dollar per tonne subsidy they were paying
1234952 but it may even take up to a year for the market to stabilize
1234953 australia exported a lot of the milch cows to china when the drought started to get bad so the cattle stock has also depleted
1234954 what we need is a mechanism where prices can be adjusted up and down i would want the importers to bring down the prices when international prices come down
1234955 as a government we cannot control the price of premium brands i asked them to introduce a budget pack with minimal packaging to protect the poor man
1234956 in just 10 years the hsbc brand has become a very powerful asset our focus on emerging markets will be underpinned by the strength of the brand
1234957 many customers across all our business lines are increasingly looking for services and solutions with an international dimension
1234958 it is not enough that we have high gdp gross domestic product growth but people must feel tangible benefits
1234959 either i was completely turned around before or i am now
1234960 to provide both the financial support and the volunteer efforts needed for the passage of proposition 8
1234961 i slipped away last night took me away from sight and the place i know all crushed upon my skin this mess i put you in and the punch i thrown it was a strange reaction for someone like you to remain on side and in a chain reaction i was down and calling for a place to hide

1234966 in my mind the significance of this is that the real estate may slow down in a slow motion fashion also
1234967 rising unemployment with not enough growth to accomodate those workers coming into the labor force
1234968 sold down the river by our own government for the sake of the chinese
1234969 somebody has to be in charge and that somebody is
1234970 when i grow up ill get to scream and yell at everyone and treat people the way i want to because thats what men get to do
1234971 the only way to control woman is to abuse them

1234973 somebodys got to take care of them if my father hadnt left things would have been different but she has never gotten over that so i have to help what gripes me is that she wont learn even the simple stuff like handling her own finances im always having to go there and make sure the electricity doesnt get turned off or the bank calls me and says shes bouncing checks again and then i have to go down there and take care of it
1234974 she was able to force herself down on to the floor and not be cooperative grabbing on to the detective a taser was dry stunned onto her arm to control her hand movement then she was cuffed
1234975 she was scared because the person identified themselves as a police officer but shes been robbed before by someone using the same technique
1234976 shes blind and they pulled her off her futon handcuffed her and tased her because he said she swung at him she cant see
1234977 im very frustrated and upset dayton police need to implement a sensitivity program
1234978 i was almost in tears because i know the lady and i look out for her because shes blind
1234979 she does not have to open her door it was a voluntary thing for her to open her door
1234980 weve set up a payment schedule but he didnt make his first payment on schedule

1234983 as you get older it is harder to have heroes but is is sort of necessary
1234984 at one time it the priesthood was considered prestigious but now it is not considered prestigious at all
1234985 if you are educated you do something more secular it is considered to be a sign of less educated less sophisticated so not many educated people are interested in becoming priests
1234986 as per shastras the eclipse would spoil food items so we did not prepare prasadam
1234987 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
1234988 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1234989 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1234990 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received
1234991 it does not preclude the applicants from reapplying for visas in the future
1234992 information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the united states
1234993 thank you for your care packages filled with coffee for the soldiers
1234994 to make it clear we the federal government are interested in the immobilizing security bracelet and look forward to receiving a written proposal

1234996 our scores went up last year but the way the ratings are done school districts are rated on their one lowest indicator and thats not fair to schools
1234997 thats not the way business evaluates or just about any place in the world evaluates but thats the way schools in texas are valued
1234998 what you do there is review the areas on which you need improvement
1234999 next school year well have more of a focus on math and science that doesnt leave out language arts and social studies we want to maintain the scores we have and improve the rest moving forward

1235006 we will also be the first state in india to put nri representatives from countries with a large goan expatriate population on a high powered committee to address their grievances this committee headed by me will have high ranking state officials including district collectors
1235007 to reconnect second and third generation goans abroad with their roots the state government has launched a programme called know goa
1235008 under this programme we will invite 15 youngsters in the age group of 18 to 26 who have distinguished themselves academically or professionally to visit goa for 15 days as guests of the state we will pay all their expenses
1235009 as part of this study we will visit people in their homes to know how many of their family members live abroad and how much money they send back home we have also asked the reserve bank of india to help us know how much remittances are coming into the state

1235021 we are looking hard at whether we can form an investment banking jv in china

1235023 i hate to admit it but i am not the best parent in my family
1235024 it is true your children learn not only from what you say but from what you do
1235025 whenever they do anything that youre proud of in your life youll be able to look back on the things that you taught them both through your words and through your deeds
1235026 fathers who have attained success in their chosen fields and have found the time to be role models in raising their children
1235027 obama when will your documents and records be made available
1235028 we are upbeat about the prospects of blocks owned by the company but we have to do our due diligence to decide whether if its worth that much money
1235029 its just an ordinary transaction we have lots of targets for acquisition in recent years the aim is to boost our upstream business for long term growth
1235030 thats just off the top of my head and not any official list i probably forgot a big one or two
1235031 from the representations and interpretations of scientific literature offered by dr paul cameron
1235032 consistently misinterpreted and misrepresented research on sexuality homosexuality and lesbianism
1235033 es ist einfach seine unertr gliche arroganz sein auftreten als graf rotz die ihm nun zum verh ngnis wurde
1235034 was sie verlangen ist ein maulkorb f r jeden fall selbst f r den fall dass irgendeine spd f hrung mit der linkspartei pds zusammengeht das mache ich auf keinen fall mit
1235035 dass irgendwann einigen nicht mehr klar ist dass es um das ringen um positionen geht und nicht um innerparteiliche streitereien und dass es im zweifelsfall um das ringen mit dem politischen gegner geht und nicht mit dem politischen freund

1235038 historically michigan has had a slight democratic edge but most polls show it to be a lot tighter than normal
1235039 12 is high compared to where it was in 2004 and 2000 just about at this juncture of the campaign where you had 6 8 as i recall
1235040 we have a new face on the scene with obama a lot of people feel they dont know him very well and they really want to get to know him hes reaching out in those areas
1235041 12 is high compared to where it was in 2004 and 2000 just about at this juncture of the campaign where you had 6 8 as i recall
1235042 if we instituted drastic conservation measures all at once people would complain and push back but if we rachet things up slowly slowly perhaps we can get everything we want without anyone noticing or reacting
1235043 if the frog gets used to the changes it will not try to leave
1235044 tried to provide context to imply that serbia was not solely to blame
1235045 choice of phrasing did not do justice to the complex and controversial nature of the issues

1235058 barack obama called on the united states to end its dependence on oil from the middle east and venezuela within 10 years
1235059 in the united states it was estimated that it cost as much to electrify a railroad as it cost to build it in the first place overhead lines and third rails require greater clearances and the right of way must be better separated to protect the public from electrocution as well as from trains which approach much more quietly than diesels or steam for most large systems the cost of electrifying the whole system is impractical and generally only some divisions are electrified in the united states only certain dense urban areas and some mountainous areas were electrified and the latter have all been discontinued the junction between electrified and unelectrified territory is the locale of engine changes for example amtrak trains had extended stops in new haven connecticut as diesel and electric locomotives were swapped a delay which contributed to the electrification of the remaining segment of the northeast corridor in 2000 9 in north america the flexibility of diesel locomotives and the relative low cost of their infrastructure has led them to prevail except where legal or other operational constraints dictate the use of electricity an example of the latter is the use of electric locomotives by amtrak and commuter railroads in the northeast

1235063 well im not sure which they were but there was quite a few
1235064 the moonbats have already entered into an agreement to not throw urine and poop
1235065 is applaud and yell congratulations when my son got his diploma the next thing i know is that im making a mad dash for the mens restroom but it was too late somebody is going to pay for my cleaning bill
1235066 i am going to sue the denver police and the public schools brooks brothers suits arent cheap
1235067 i had to suffer the humiliation and indignity of defecating on my self for mutter the words you go girl when they handed my daughter the diploma i will never forget that horrible night the public schools and the denver police ruined a perfectly good graduation those pigs
1235068 things work far better with the defecator it was amusing to see the shock and awe on the faces of the out of control parents as they grabbed their shorts while running
1235069 he nor anyone on his staff had anything to do with the
1235070 i think that as much fun as ill have using this on glenn spagnuolo and re create 68 at the convention i can think of five members of the supreme court id like to use it on right now those communists
1235071 global spotlight could draw tens of thousands of demonstrators including self described anarchists who the police fear will infiltrate peaceful protest groups to disrupt the weeklong event

1235075 los israel s est n aterrados porque en el 2020 los palestinos podr an ser mayor a y elegir al alcalde
1235076 me agarraron y me sacaron fuera de la tienda a empujones me esposaron por la espalda y me metieron en el coche
1235077 prefer morir en aquella celda que ser trasladada en un coche policial ir esposada a un hospital
1235078 no tengo nada contra ella pero no puedo perdonar a los que me humillaron
1235079 a mi t a le iban a sacar un esp ritu que supuestamente ten a para eso trajeron a un se or de la guajira y a las once de la noche comenzaron a hacerle oraciones pero mi t o luis dec a frases como la sangre de cristo tiene poder y tambi n la insultaba l estaba como loco comenz a darle patadas a mi t a en todo el cuerpo y en la cara le met a las manos en sus partes ntimas y sacaba materia fecal le dec a que el esp ritu se le hab a subido en el abdomen a ella y la desnud completamente nos mand a ba arnos bajo la lluvia y utilizaba aceites
1235080 nos enfrentamos a un macabro suceso como es la muerte de una persona de una forma violenta al parecer por intentar sacarle unos supuestos esp ritus que ten a la v ctima por estos hechos fueron capturados en flagrancia los se ores luis mercado polo guillermo barrios guill n y rosa lina polo
1235081 me declaro culpable en la ley terrenal pero en la ley divina no porque hice la voluntad del se or yo a mi hermana no le hice nada se lo hice al demonio ella est sana a los tres d as de bautizado dios me dijo t eres el hombre para que abras el coraz n vete y m tete al horno un hombre vicario con 21 hijos los ojos que saqu no son los de mi hermanita los ojos de mi hermana est n sanos ella estaba pose da por 3 mil 600 demonios que se llaman legi n y el se or jesucristo me eligi porque soy el hombre que no le tiene miedo al enemigo
1235082 i think we all knew that there are so many and they are playing so well and consistently and working so hard
1235083 now we can see that the asian tour is becoming very strong the top players are coming to the states and they can also win in the states before it was a different story
1235084 so the rest of us just need to prepare and continue working hard with so many more good players around
1235085 se ri pak she was my hero because of watching golf

1235089 nosotros ramos ilegales y son m s culpables ellos que nosotros porque ellos representaban al estado y estaban obligados a proteger a esas comunidades y nos utilizaban a nosotros para combatir a la guerrilla nosotros cometimos muchos homicidios y tenemos que responder pero ellos tambi n deben responder
1235090 murieron m s inocentes que culpables pero as es la guerra
1235091 im only going to cater to my own style of usage
1235092 well leave each of the councils to come to grips with this issue in their own way
1235093 some may go down the path of mandatory desexing but its very important we identify cats and have them registered and ensure that if they are found they are returned to their rightful owners
1235094 the important thing to come out of the trial besides council having the opportunity to do this is well collect a database on the issue
1235095 we cannot guarantee that grocery prices will come down because the biggest impact on grocery prices is those international factors as the report outlines
1235096 we need to look at the causes as to why it is that children are perhaps missing out on growing up as a child the appropriate amount of leisure or indeed if its schooling thats particularly serious
1235097 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1235098 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1235099 this is a 22 hectare site of which at least 11 is public open space
1235100 its concrete and bitumen now and has been for nearly 100 years
1235101 this is going to be one of the great sites of sydney
1235102 last week the prime minister said he wanted sydney to be the asia pacific finance hub
1235103 thats only going to happen if we deliver barangaroo and if weve got sufficient office space in this city to house these new finance workers
1235104 if that was to be approved it would be all delivered in the southern commercial precinct
1235105 the southern commercial precinct is already approved with existing building envelopes and the 120 000 square metres would be delivered within those building envelopes so the overshadowing and the wind effectuation is being taken into account
1235106 you read the hqcc report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1235107 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1235108 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1235109 if you see harm being done whether youre a doctor or a nurse or a bureaucrat youve got to report it
1235110 change is a weird thing we always know its coming but we never seem to be ready for it
1235111 the rudd government needs to get on their bike and get on with unit pricing
1235112 theyve had already seven months and if theyre going to deliver on lower grocery prices unit pricing has to come first
1235113 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined
1235114 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1235115 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and metcash pay suppliers are reflected in movements in shelf prices over time
1235116 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1235117 competition between retailers is however sufficient to ensure that coles and woolworths cannot simply retain all of the benefits of the lower wholesale prices they extract at least some of the benefits flow to consumers in the form of lower retail prices
1235118 telebranchen har generelt det problem at det totale marked slet ikke vokser og mobilmarkedet kun langsomt der er tilmed prispres p tale delen s de leder desperat efter nye v kstomr der
1235119 mobilt bredb nd er den helt store v kstmotor i branchen i jeblikket hvis man ser p hvor mange penge selskaberne bruger p reklame for det mobile bredb nd er det tydeligt at det er det omr de de s tter deres lid til fremover
1235120 det bliver interessant at se om mobilt bredb nd faktisk begynder at kannibalisere p fastnetbredb nd vi har jo set der er flere og flere der v lger at droppe deres fastnettelefon for at g over til mobiltelefon

1235126 there wasnt much of a choice once they told me the seriousness i couldnt risk being confined to a wheelchair just to play a 16th year

1235132 ive got lizard pie and some rough ale will that do
1235133 i wont soil it or anything i wont leave any unsightly smears its just that i have a slight problem in my underpants i think theres a couple of minute life forms in there and id rather like to set them free
1235134 you do have one i suppose you might know it as the room of many tinkles
1235135 we have to get out of here theres a danger so great that its palpable
1235136 rootley you are young and nimble brother alfonso you are vast and so physically imposing that you could probably club them into submission with your willy and i am trained in all sorts of fisticuffs and wear the shield of righteousness about me they are armed with nothing more terrifying than cudgels i say we fight them
1235137 what 112 do you want if its non reproductive sexual intercourse i should warn you that im probably really awful at it there must be so many local maidens who do it all the time in any case theres still a load of leaf litter down there you might catch something nasty
1235138 wendy nuthatch i live in belchers pond i have three brothers all from the same litter their names are cuthbert captain thrudsday and the 113 unstoppable gherkin
1235139 youre not worth enough to finance a complete redecoration but i should be able to fix the door and replace a few chairs
1235140 just as long as i dont have to eat any more custard
1235141 my hard work and attention during the few hours paid off
1235142 i was earning a good salary but the desire to prove to myself that i can be somebody one day was haunting me so i grabbed the opportunity
1235143 i was able to make it because my boss and superiors were very understanding
1235144 im really excited and thrilled to have qualified for college i just wish to graduate and go back to work
1235145 everything here is so good compared to those things that we received during our school days earlier
1235146 we really should have drank more in vegas as if every sip we made 1000
1235147 karachi holds great significance for the taliban movement and the taliban aim to establish themselves in the port city to end vulgarity in the city
1235148 talibans presence in karachi will make it safe and bring peace to the city

1235156 she always is going to quit she has a pleasant disposition and shes kind of funny
1235157 its just a delightful song and dance extravaganza set in the roaring 20s
1235158 boy has met girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back in the end is the substance of the plot
1235159 eagle basically said theres a part i want you to play i said what ive never done this before bob
1235160 they were also trying to promote reagle players so i agreed to do that because its summertime and my schedule is more open
1235161 ive always thought she had a real good sense of wit thats kind of what this role is
1235162 ive known her since she was in high school i knew her as a member of the school committee and as a city councilor it just seemed like it was a neat role for her most of the lines are short but shes in almost every single scene
1235163 usually my characters usually are fast talking people this character is a very naive slow talking good man sometimes thats the hardest kind of role to play
1235164 certainly the most rewarding part is being out there with such a great cast
1235165 this is perhaps the best casting ive seen in the last 10 years
1235166 i think one of the most interesting parts is an actor gets to separate reality from fantasy
1235167 this has been a suspension of reality a suspension from waltham government management mccarthy and i dont even talk about that
1235168 saturday and sunday it was a 12 hour rehearsal and then i go in between my mayor duties yesterday i have off
1235169 ive made most of the practices but sometimes i cant because of my schedule here
1235170 for someone thats never done a show before shes extraordinary already
1235171 what shes done is remarkable and extraordinary and to never be in a play with lines and be able to do what shes done is just great
1235172 we particularly wanted to have shows this year that appealed to families
1235173 it was first produced in 1925 and it had a broadway revival in 1971
1235174 the interesting thing is the original producer of the show harry frazee owned the boston red sox and at the same time was a broadway producer of
1235175 hes particularly disliked because he sold babe ruth to the yankees to finance the show
1235176 im always in the audience i go to see the reagle players often
1235177 i never realized how much work it is to put on a production we only see the end product the people have been great the performers have been great i cant believe im doing it
1235178 city councilors should not be put in this situation to pick and chose which streets get done
1235179 april 1 to june 18 thats the reason no other

1235182 mrs dorothy slamin hill started the band with a collection of high school students and the band just grew from there
1235183 i love playing the music i love playing for people
1235184 since i was 9 years old i played trumpets i was an italian bugler in the army at fort monmouth n j theyre doing very good right now the band does about 20 parades and about six to 10 concerts a year
1235185 i happened to be passing by the common one evening in waltham and the band was performing in concert
1235186 i went on several trips out of state and i went to russia
1235187 sometimes we carried the banner most of the time we were marching out in front of the band
1235188 the waltham community has been very supportive to us over the years
1235189 they come out to our concerts and they support our fundraisers i frequently run into waltham people who themselves take pride in the band its a good feeling all around

1235211 the nitty gritty the wedding party four friends and two spankings
1235212 no the wedding was going to be in september but aunt amber and paul decided to go with june instead
1235213 highly offended by pauls behavior at mcgeerys thought a bare bottomed spanking would give him something to think about
1235214 but my propane tank was empty an i had to go out and get it filled
1235215 paul talked me into table dancing and i dont know i just did i was up on tinas coffee table dancing when she returned
1235216 he paul kicked my jesus statue and broke the head off i gave them both a good spanking side by side they ate their dinner standing at the table with their red bottoms facing the window
1235217 one spanking lead to the initiating of another one on and on
1235218 shannon ambers sister was getting a real kick out of spanking amber let me tell you it was a complete hoot seeing that

1235237 the real question for todays broadband networks is not whether they need to be managed but rather how
1235238 unmanaged networks result in serious degradation of service availability and quality for all users
1235239 it will also means that customers will be paying more for less as providers are forced to continually build out their networks to stay ahead of the massive bandwidth consumption growth
1235240 the us is lucky in that its first absinthes are high quality products distilled from whole herbs
1235241 in the european market 80 to 90 percent is industrial junk
1235242 today on the open spot market a gigabyte of mlc nand flash memory is about one third the price of a gigabyte of slc nand therefore a 64gb c200 laptop drive will be about one third the price of a 64gb p200 enterprise drive
1235243 we are convinced that on the very low end and on the very high end ssd will penetrate the notebook netbook markets but the mainstream notebook will remain hdd for the foreseeable future
1235244 progress in general on ssd adoption has been slower then we would of all preferred or predicted and the truth is wider adoption for ssd will probably take a bit longer
1235245 ssds age gracefully they degrade gracefully we can predict this based on your usage model how much longer that drive will last
1235246 typical raw nand write endurance is ten thousand cycles for mlc while slc is typically a hundred thousand cycles
1235247 the typical notebook user only writes two to four gigabytes per day even if you look at 40 or 60 gigabytes a day you still dont need the 10 000 cycles of mlc in five years
1235248 one of the things that ssd manufacturers have been slow to learn is that you cant just take a compact flash controller throw some nand on there and call it an ssd
1235249 the application of storing data on a notebook and certainly on the enterprise is far different than that controller was designed to support
1235250 weve got a lot of processing power in this controller weve got a very large dram buffer attached to this controller so having that dram buffer both allows us to increase the performance of the drive in addition to minimizing the wear
1235251 a year ago the board and investors made it very clear they felt that green design was the right direction for the corporation to take
1235252 we just touched the surface of the potential on the web
1235253 now we need to turn up the volume and to get more people involved explore what the future could look like and inspire us to do it
1235254 we are trying to make peoples interaction with the technology more natural and more physical
1235255 some of these things are right around the corner and some will take another 10 years to unfold
1235256 traditionally you would have to submit code but now you can just bring an idea even a sketch on a piece of paper
1235257 they are trying to show that they are taking the leadership of the designers and they are looking to innovate in the areas where there is still room for innovation
1235258 it has been a very static area there is not a lot more that you can do in terms of the functionality but there is always something that can be done about the look and feel of the browser and thats where the public is always happy to see changes
1235259 were very strict were probably the strictest among the web sites we dont encourage racy bikini content on our web site
1235260 this year you can see the industry has shaped up and realize you have to be very strict and careful
1235261 there are obvious ones we simply do not let them go up
1235262 its simple if these things get shown then the site will get shut down we make sure there are no such things
1235263 many of the web 2 0 sites have their own self censorship polices and built in systems to comply with government regulations
1235264 but i think this compromise costs them it is a tricky method to help businesses find their way to survive in china
1235265 its not just energy there are a host of markets from fuels to electricity to storage to efficiency to water treatment
1235266 keep going from up here we may be able to see which way to get home
1235267 the evil monster minds will pwn the universe though as long as the lightening league can it will do its best to thwart them at every turn
1235268 in addition to trialling different methods of encouraging identification and desexing they will also collect baseline data to monitor the numbers of levels of animals being euthanased
1235269 we must ensure that american companies operating in repressive regimes protect fundamental human rights
1235270 transparency about speech restrictions and to carefully implemented protections for user data
1235271 you could not see such things happen before in china because of the controlled media
1235272 you can see grassroots based technology helping people become empowered
1235273 if something happened in the world and there are 10 sources of information on this event even if i block nine you can get one thats enough for you you dont need the other nine resources once you get that information you can forward that to others
1235274 i dont think it will work to block or filter something
1235275 it was completely different from what i learned in school
1235276 its hard to believe the first time you see a different edition of history at first i felt its unbelievable then i felt angry because i was deceived for such a long time
1235277 it is not like i want to knock down the government or rise in rebellion against government officials
1235278 it is just a shame that there are many good tools and information that we cannot access and use

1235280 hello to all of the 80s children and fans out there my name is magnolia simms and i am definitely a child of the eighties a huge fan of smurfwreck i wanted to provide a girls view many thanks to shawn for letting me provide my memories and point of view my mind is completely spinning with so many ideas to write about first so many lovely and interesting memories i think ill start off about something that ive recently come back across and decided to regain my collection of furrever friends were made by kenner in the later half of the 80s they are small plush kitties with velcro attachable tails unfortunately they were only made for a short time and only six produced the six were bushytail pink honeytail yellow powdertail white snowytail blue posietail purple rosietail white w pink splotches amp peach tail they each came with two tails but you could buy attachable tails called tail toppers separately different color tails had different colored ribbons bows w elastic on them these were such neat toys when i was a little girl i had posietail and a couple of the tail toppers added to her i would use her as a scarf in the wintertime other times i would have her tossed over one shoulder like an old fashioned movie star with a fur i loved that she was not only a toy but a friend and a fashion accessory there wasnt anywhere that i wouldnt wear my furrever friend at times when she wasnt being worn i would wrap her tail around her in a circle as if she was in a little bed or all curled up i came across what i believe to have been a mail order item called a tail salon i received it from an old kenner employee who acquired old stock it was in a plastic clear package or bag and has a violet colored attachable tail ribbons bows and pillow type thing kenner also made little clip on kitties called clip n tail they were a firm plastic with fuzzy tails that were about six inches or so long they also made six different ones that im aware of there have been rumors that in the 1988 kenner catalog they showed six non kitty furrever friends including a fox raccoon and mink also a carrying case i am trying to find a copy of that catalog or pictures from it to prove the rumor so right now im in the middle of regaining some of my childhood im searching for these furrever friends and accessories to add to my collection and to share with a new generation until next time remember your heart can still be in the 80s even living in the present

1235284 hey welcome to prison and im so glad youre going to be my bunk mate
1235285 in a softening economy people are going to be very hesitant about price increases and things like that so thats given us enough room to cut and weve got more room out there
1235286 the combination of the credit crunch consecutive official and market based interest rate increases and high petrol prices are hitting services sales hard while weak readings for new orders inventories and employment paint a less than rosy outlook for the sector in the months ahead
1235287 action cards were somewhat hard for me to find and i only found the packs in one little mom and pop store in los angeles i grew up in texas and i used to visit l a when i was a kid back in the summer of 85 and 86 that store had the packs for 1 each and they came with eight cards
1235288 as a little bonus each pack had a small sticker that featured the box art of one transformer character alongside their tech spec motto
1235289 and 11 decepticons i never knew about the eleventh decepticon skywarp until three years ago when i started doing research online as the rarest sticker in the set he is extremely hard to find
1235290 the second set is crazy rare and most transformers fans are unaware of its existence which is odd because it was part of one of the most popular transformers promotions ever back when cookie crisp did their mail away jazz promotion each cereal box also included a little square lenticular transformer sticker the exact number of stickers in this set is unknown to this day i know because ive asked many of my friends who are way more into transformers than me and ive even been able to contact some hardcore mega collectors who could be considered true experts in the field and nobody is sure how many stickers there were in this set
1235291 so far ive been able to confirm the existence of 14 in this set astrotrain beachcomber blitzwing galvatron megatron mixmaster omega supreme perceptor skywarp slag snarl soundwave swoop ultra magnus
1235292 this is by no means a complete list but it reflects everything ive been able to find out about this set so far ive also talked to one person i consider a sticker authority and they put the number in the set at 22 further broken down into 6 released in the us with a copyright stamping of 1985 8 released in canada with a copyright stamping of 1985 and 8 released in canada with a copyright stamping of 1986 i havent been able to confirm the accuracy of this estimate and my research isnt complete enough to know for sure whether certain characters were canadian exclusive or if the us got them too without the canadian copyright

1235297 the banks forecast remains that inflation will fall below three per cent during 2010
1235298 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1235299 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1235300 these are dreadful numbers and continue to show domestic demand is falling away the rba would have taken this into consideration today we expect taking into light these numbers and the retail sales data last week for the rba to look at easing rates some time this year
1235301 the combination of tight financial conditions high petrol prices and low confidence is weighing heavily

1235307 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1235308 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1235309 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1235433 oh woe was me poor me i had a hard life
1235434 i have no complaints no regrets where ive been and what ive done its been a fun career
1235435 my thought was rehab for another week or two because ive been a guy that plays through pain and fights through injuries when they told me i was done it was pretty hard for the first day and a half
1235436 he had a way to put a smile on my face and kind of get me out of bad moods
1235437 when i look back after im done its players like chris gray that make it absolutely worth it to do this to coach hes that good a guy
1235438 its sad because chris means a lot to this team hes one of the better linemen ive played in my career and im not just saying that
1235439 hoss thats what we call him big hoss i dont know how many years hes been in the league and hes still going
1235440 chris gray might not always get his man the way its drawn up but he almost always finds a way to get his man
1235441 i think he would have retired earlier but i promised him he wouldnt have as many reps wouldnt have to practice as hard
1235442 every year somebody would get hurt and hed have more reps than anyone

1235455 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1235456 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires

1235479 its not all on me i just happen to be the trigger man its not like im going to go into a game thinking i have to throw this many touchdown passes and for this many yards you cant think like that
1235480 there was some fierce competition in the spring from mitch and aaron corp a redshirt freshman it was fun and were all great friends about it some people dont understand that but its true when were in our quarterback room were all trying to win were all trying to beat whatever defense were up against
1235481 more than anything those three games i played last year confirmed to me that this is a game i love and this is what i was born to do i couldnt wait to play

1235483 weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning
1235484 casting all your cares on him for he cares for you
1235485 he is despised and rejected by man a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we did not esteem him surely he has born our griefs and carried our sorrows
1235486 sorrow is better than laughter for by a sad countenance the heart is made better
1235487 for we do not sorrow as those who have no hope
1235488 whatever happens my dear brothers and sisters rejoice in the lord
1235489 always be joyful never stop praying be thankful in all circumstances for this is gods will for you who belong to christ jesus
1235490 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of god

1235498 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1235499 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1235500 do we have a cultural issue on that absolutely not
1235501 we have a playing group that lives every day disciplined and focussed on winning a premiership
1235502 we are effectively removing all fuel surcharges and taking on fuel price risk through this time
1235503 this is the beginning of a big change in mobile computing
1235504 we would have gotten drowned out with all the noise
1235505 we just thought a boom was going to happen and it really didnt
1235506 we didnt feel it was gaining the traction that we wanted it to
1235507 encouraged or forced to buy their next vehicle instead of lease it
1235508 i like the fact that every two years you get a new car and you dont have to pay anything to return it
1235509 i cant drive a car for six or seven years i just cant do that
1235510 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1235511 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1235512 two or three months ago these developments would have prompted a buying frenzy
1235513 however relatively minor supply side events can be easily absorbed within an environment of surplus product supplies and declining demand
1235514 it seems like a combination of people discounting the threat and how quickly it looks like its going to disappear
1235515 currently there are no plans to shut down the refinery
1235516 if its only a couple of days well be ok
1235517 if we start going to five or six days well be impacted
1235518 a number of potential companies have been unwilling to invest the time and resources necessary to participate due to uncertainties concerning the projects longevity
1235519 we intend this extension to reassure trucking companies that they will have sufficient time to realize a return on their investment and we anticipate additional participation with this extra time
1235520 the administration has shown time and again that when it comes to this program they are willing to run roughshod over congress and the american public
1235521 this dispute is about the administrations effort to allow long haul mexican trucks into this country in a way that i believe compromises safety on american roads

1235535 in de beginfase had ik het nochtans moeilijk onvoldoende gerecupereerd van de ronde van denemarken waarvan ik pas gisteravond laat terugkeerde maar ik ben tevreden
1235536 i will give you a reform administration that will put politics aside to work for all americans i pledge to turn the page on 16 years of often petty and mean spirited partisanship so we can tackle the big challenges we face so i pledge that neither i nor my vice president will seek re election neither i nor my vice president will spend a day an hour a minute campaigning or raising money not for ourselves nor for anyone else there will be no political office in my white house there will be no place for a dick morris or with all due respect a karl rove

1235542 i witnessed it growing up in the 60s during the riots id be in the car with my father and siblings and if he saw someone being beaten up he got out and intervened
1235543 another time a man had been beaten at brighton and california avenues he was bloody and my father jumped out put him in the car with us and took him to allegheny general we were just kids we were frightened but we saw him functioning this way and seeing him like that influenced me
1235544 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1235545 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1235546 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1235547 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1235548 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1235549 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1235550 ausdr cklich begr t der fahrgastverband pro bahn jedoch dass die deutsche bahn ag erstmals offiziell ank ndigt die h lfte der heute rund 180r intercity z ge durch neue intercity fahrzeuge ersetzen zu wollen die aktuelle gesch ftspolitik der db dr ngt aber den eindruck auf dass diese z ge bevorzugt im auslandsverkehr eingesetzt werden sollen anders k nnen wir nicht erkl ren dass die db bereits im dezember dieses jahres erneut inl ndische intercity verbindungen und schw cher nachgefragte ice verbindungen streichen will
1235551 man muss diese ma nahmen mit der lupe in den unterlagen der db suchen
1235552 oft erfahren fahrg ste erst aus dem abfahrtsplan dass ihr zug nicht mehr f hrt
1235553 halle und magdeburg sind am wochenende bis zu 18 stunden lang nicht mit einem fernzug erreichbar von hannover nach emden fahren t glich nur noch drei intercity z ge nach trier vor 13 uhr nur noch einer auf linien auf denen die db nicht einmal konkurrenz durch vergleichbare regionalz ge hat wie zwischen erfurt und d sseldorf streicht die db bei jedem fahrplanwechsel ein weiteres zugpaar
1235554 deshalb hat der fahrgastverband pro bahn bereits gespr che mit dem db vorstand aufgenommen die auch konstruktiv verlaufen die db muss ein konzept finden wie fernverkehrsz ge mit hundert oder hundertf nfzig reisenden noch angeboten werden k nnen bis jetzt reagiert die db nur mit zugstreichungen mit der jetzt angek ndigten bestellung von langen intercity wagenz gen ist das problem nicht zu l sen
1235555 linien nach amsterdam warschau krakau prag wien graz und verona brauchen dringend moderne fahrzeuge und bringen mehr einnahmen als inlandsverbindungen
1235556 ice z ge hat die db bereits systematisch aus dem inlandsverkehr abgezogen ice z ge die fr her zwischen d sseldorf und erfurt fuhren verkehren jetzt nach wien und diesel ice die f r die verbindung n rnberg dresden gebaut wurden fahren jetzt nach kopenhagen wenn ab dezember mehr intercity z ge nach amsterdam fahren verliert die universit tsstadt m nster gleichzeitig die direktverbindung nach berlin wir begr en jede verbesserung des auslandsverkehrs und die zusammenarbeit mit den bahnen der nachbarl nder aber das darf nicht zu lasten der innerdeutschen verbindungen gehen
1235557 die deutsche bahn ag ist nicht dem gemeinwohl verpflichtet sondern der rendite das ist ihr auftrag seit der bahnreform 1994 und es ist der db auch nicht vorzuwerfen dass sie danach handelt
1235558 an vielen stellen des bundesgebiets k mpfen st dte und regionen um den erhalt ihrer fernverkehrsverbindungen meistens ohne erfolg wenn die db ein glaubw rdiger partner der reisenden und der regionen sein will dann muss sie als erstes die angek ndigten zugstreichungen zur cknehmen und mit anderen strategien als der ausd nnung des fahrplans auf die anforderungen des marktes reagieren 100 und mehr reisende in einem zug sind etwas anderes als keine nachfrage
1235559 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
1235560 it looks as though the game has come too quickly for him
1235561 the evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs and lower asset values has restrained demand
1235562 he went swimming a couple of times then he went to find out how deep it was
1235563 he said he found a rock and he was standing on it and a couple of minutes later he was floating in the water and he said help im drowning
1235564 i knew terry was a very good boy and hell be sorely missed by the whole community
1235565 i grew up around the river the rivers dangerous we got a swimming pool
1235566 if theres not adults the kids shouldnt be in there
1235567 he always had a smile on his face but you could see the glint of the devil in him
1235568 the last conversation he had with his grandmother was going to the festival
1235569 come over here give me a hug i love you see why we want you to listen see why
1235570 your cousins gone it couldve been you it couldve been any of these boys
1235571 the department store segment is not going to get better
1235572 theyve got to get the back to school merchandise on track fast
1235573 boscovs to its credit was a very solidly run company
1235574 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1235575 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1235576 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1235577 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1235578 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1235579 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1235580 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1235581 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1235582 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1235583 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1235584 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1235585 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1235586 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1235587 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1235588 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1235589 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1235590 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1235591 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1235592 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1235593 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1235594 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1235595 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1235596 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1235597 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1235598 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1235599 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1235600 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1235601 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1235602 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1235603 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1235604 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1235605 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1235606 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1235607 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1235608 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1235609 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1235610 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1235611 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1235612 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1235613 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1235614 who are open to doing something on the production side
1235615 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1235616 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1235617 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1235618 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1235619 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1235620 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1235621 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1235622 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1235623 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1235624 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1235625 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1235626 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1235627 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1235628 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1235629 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1235630 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1235631 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1235632 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1235633 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1235634 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1235635 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1235636 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1235637 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1235638 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1235639 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1235640 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1235641 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1235642 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1235643 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1235644 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1235645 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1235646 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1235647 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1235648 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor

1235704 well see what the tests reveal i dont think its serious i dont think hell be shut down a long time

1235707 i knew it was gone right when it came off the bat he threw a fastball and i put a good swing on it

1235815 when the military says robot they mean everything from self driving trucks up to what you would conventionally think of as a robot you would more accurately call them autonomous systems rather than robots
1235816 its a chain of command thing you dont want to give autonomy to a weapons delivery system you want to have a human hit the button you dont want the robot to make the wrong decision you want to have a human to make all of the important decisions
1235817 its oftentimes like the difference between the adverb and noun you can act intelligently or you can be intelligent im much more interested in the adverb for my robots
1235818 when i envision the future of robots i always think of the jetsons george jetson never sat down at a computer to task rosie to clean the house somehow they had this local exchange of information so what weve been working on is how we can use the local environment rather than a computer as a tasking medium to the robot
1235819 we forget that when were controlling robots in the lab its really pretty safe and no ones trying to kill us but if you are in a war zone and youre hunched over a laptop thats not a good place to be you want to be able to use your eyes in one place and use your hand to control the robot without tying up all of your attention

1235825 to me it all indicates that the person experimented with the ways to dry the spores and produced small batches some of them not so successfully he later used to fill up different envelopes
1235826 the spores are naturally clumpy as i understand he just over baked the first batches
1235827 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1235828 the investigators looked around they decided they had to find somebody they went after all of them but he looked the most susceptible to pressure
1235829 it is like prisoners of war if they are harassed enough they will be driven to do anything but i dont believe he would have done what they say he did

1235838 the question is whether both are really trying to make serious long term solutions or if theyre just using this to get votes
1235839 it raises taxes on oil coal and natural gas its the trifecta of bad energy policy
1235840 i dont think its a good idea because of the effects on the stock market

1235866 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course

1235868 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts
1235869 it was a point in my life where i was thinking either aspergers was going to define me or i was going to be able to work around it

1235874 he was face to face with the true meaning of work hadibut as in had he but realized work was invented to take care of drudgery hadibut it wasnt that work
1235875 work was invented to channel drudgery to put all the shit in the same place and keep it away from the fun stuff
1235876 people who dont work run the risk of having disorder run rampant and flood over its levees and stink up their whole lives that was rogers situation exactly
1235877 or maybe not exactly maybe there was one other element one thing more that work took care of that roger was missing you could take a more positive view of work you could say that work is what connects us to the rest of the world because work is the way we marry the world pretty much for better or worse work is most of how we enter the earth aside from our families and a novelist who doesnt have work whose time is his own to spend as he wishes why he or she may find his or her writing getting more and more ingrown less and less connected to how most people spend most of their time
1235878 and now for it to come to this is very very disappointing

1235886 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1235887 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1235888 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1235889 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors

1236102 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1236103 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1236104 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there

1236134 i would say we have a 1 a and a 1 b with turner and steffy then no 2 is portis by no means am i saying hes out of the hunt but there is a difference between those two guys and him in understanding how to run the offense
1236135 offensively the big question is at quarterback and who will be that quarterback
1236136 we may play multiple quarterbacks i dont know its an area that if we can get the production we expect we have a chance to have a good offense
1236137 i definitely think everyone can contribute in a different area but were all competing to be the quarterback not one of the quarterbacks
1236138 it was a crazy time there was a lot of excitement basically i just never looked back
1236139 after that it was kind of my job i still feel like its my job that if i play my game ill be all right but ive got two quarterbacks behind me fighting for the job well see what happens
1236140 i started no three and ended three maybe this year ill start first and end first only time will tell
1236141 i like being on top i do feel like i should be on top after last season but its a competition
1236142 ive never seen it before but it could happen that would be something else whoever can help this team win
1236143 it would definitely give the defense something more to prepare for during the week
1236144 it has been kind of stiff we just thought wed do things as soon as we can if there is a problem
1236145 i hope everybody would realize that i dont think that we can just take the week off and that gosh we got it made now everybody
1236146 that was a start its going to get tougher and tougher down the road
1236147 the quarterbacks were trying to throw on rhythm the receivers were trying to get to their spots with efficiency running hard i thought the efforts were good
1236148 i thought colt brennan was the least of the quarterbacks who got the tempo up
1236149 he would come up a little bit too slow for me i thought todd did a wonderful job pressing the tempo i thought jason was steady i want him to go even faster
1236150 it was like having a home game there was a lot of burgundy
1236151 we wanted to see if he could handle a whole game see how he would react i thought he did really well there were no shanks

1236171 it always is a big challenge to make sure the post olympic legacy will be used
1236172 i do think there are some opportunities that havent been used and i dont know if and when they will be
1236173 i would like to see it as an olympic park where people would use it
1236174 we in athens dont have a large park or one like chicagos millennium park
1236175 hope and pray the necessary actions will be taken to make the most out of these venues
1236176 other venues have remained in the ownership of the state and have not been properly maintained or utilized

1236183 one problem of course is that they dont correct astigmatism
1236184 i would love to buy a pair just because they are neat and to support a good cause maybe they could do a buy one for 100 and five people in a developing country will get glasses kind of promotion
1236185 wouldnt it be great to discover that the chief problem in a lot of the more war torn parts of the world was that people were just really grouchy over not being able to see clearly day in and day out and eventually this irritant caused them to snap
1236186 well you could probably make this work in 1908 using glass and vegetable oil the thing thats really lacking is the plastic film
1236187 there is nothing in this that inherently limits it to ugly glasses

1236189 we were told she was in shock we went to our local hospital wrexham maelor a e because we were concerned
1236190 we thought she was showing signs of someone who had had a stroke because she had a droopy mouth but we didnt realise a child could have a stroke
1236191 i found the stroke association on the internet and they have been absolutely brilliant with us but i dont feel that we should have been in that position where we have had to find that out for ourselves
1236192 its incredible we have seen such an improvement in such a short time
1236193 the child i came home with was not our daughter as far as i was concerned shed died in that hospital and they had sent us home with a stranger how she has pulled through i dont know

1236227 recently you posted an early picture of dana point if you look at the right side you can just barely make out the old richfield oil company tower that stood on p c h for many years on the sides facing north and south the company printed the word richfield in about five foot high block letters just below the richfield sign was the word service printed horizontally the tower was quite a landmark but at night that thing was spectacular blue neon outlined each letter and the supports of the tower it was so bright you could see it long before you got to the gas station even boats and ships could see it out at sea when richfield merged with atlantic oil to form arco the tower remained for several years although the original station had been enlarged and was now an arco station i was wondering if you might know where i might get a picture of it

1236232 oh gosh i know the ozoids are writhing even as i write this
1236233 i switched to cnn and was pleasantly surprised by obamas plan okay i take that back i was more than pleasantly surprised i was excited and inspired by the ideas that obama spoke about this morning in the birthplace of the auto industry and though i know that this speech was tailor made for michigan and designed to strengthen his poll numbers i believe that this energy plan is the only way forward for our nation and that if obama is serious and dedicated to these issues we may have a solution not only to climate change but to the ailing economy the things that we need to do to stall the oncoming danger of climate change are the very things that obama outlined in his speech we must invest heavily in alternative energy if we dont come up with the capital to take the risk out of these start up industries they will fail we need investment tax credits for solar energy and wind power without them there are major solar projects that will move to europe and the wind farms will not get built here but move to germany our auto industry is near bankruptcy ford and gm have reported the lowest sales in nearly 30 years

1236247 it has been confirmed by the fbi that aafia siddiqui is alive
1236248 she is injured but alive and she is in afghanistan

1236254 during the conversation the freeze for freeze issue will not be discussed like the last talks in geneva they will only discuss the common points of the two packages
1236255 every time that us authorities accused aafia of something we showed it was false
1236256 they accused her of brokering a diamond ring for giving the proceeds to al qaeda they said she was in liberia when she did this we showed she was here in boston running a play group with her sister
1236257 they said she was involved in the production of neuro chemical to be used by terrorists in the us we showed that she was not
1236258 when ask for evidence they never gave us any evidence
1236259 i have verified that he is an fbi agent and on friday morning he called me back and verified what he had told mohammed siddiqui

1236299 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1236300 for fear it will harm pollards own good and israels efforts to assist him
1236301 the state is throwing sand in the publics eyes and is shamelessly lying to the court when it claims it financially supports pollard and his wife the state cannot go on deceiving the public by making it believe that it does anything for pollard not only did the state abandon pollard for 23 years it also has the audacity to lie about it if the state ever gave one shekel to pollard or his wife let it prove it we know the truth and it will come to light in the courtroom

1236318 its a great loss for our family its also a loss for the country
1236319 he was always really happy he returned this is his home
1236320 he was a writer first and his resistance came from that
1236321 he criticized the soviet union not as a westerner but as a russian with deep orthodox values
1236322 he was trying to find a third way for russia
1236323 for me he opened my eyes to a new side of life that i had never heard about
1236324 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
1236325 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1236326 the entire thorny path of his life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism

1236342 the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain
1236343 so when sen mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis
1236344 its important to remember that hes been part of that failure
1236345 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1236346 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1236347 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1236348 i am confident that the air quality will not pose major problems to athletes and visitors here

1236355 for all of richard jordan gatlings cool headed technical finesse and businessmans brio he actually came up with his gun he claimed for the most tender hearted of reasons as a way of saving lives it occurred to me he wrote to a friend in 1877 that if i could invent a machine a gun which could by rapidity of fire enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred that it would to a great extent supersede the necessity of large armies and consequently exposure to battle and disease be greatly diminished as disingenuous and self serving as that sentiment sounds it ended up being quite correct innovations in arms steadily reduced the relative lethality of battles not to mention the cost of waging war throughout the twentieth century
1236356 men women and children were like stalks of wheat beneath a scythe
1236357 the gatling gun is a weapon of death but its story is not altogether grim for it is also the story of a nation on the rise and of a man who by inventing a new kind of machine helped propel it in that upward trajectory it is the story of a country just at the moment when its destiny begins to stir and of an individual whose career was hitched to that amazing creative and economic boom it is the story of one genius who helped push america to the top a man of decency and vision and ambition a man who held dozens of patents for a variety of life enhancing gadgets but who died disillusioned his name attached in the popular mind not to plows or bicycles or flush toilets or dry cleaning machines all of which he improved but to a gun a utilitarian device whose use came down to a chilling simplicity death
1236358 was no crackpot eccentric but a respected and socially connected businessman married to the daughter of a prominent indianapolis physician
1236359 difficult to reconcile the man who created the gatling gun with the loyal husband and gentle father to reconcile the canny competitive arms merchant with the decent peace loving citizen
1236360 a new variety of plow a cotton cultivator a washer to tighten gears more effectively
1236361 nine patents for agricultural implements his inventions include a hemp brake a rotary plow a lath making machine a gearing machine and a steam driven marine ram
1236362 fed by a gravity driven hopper the seeds dropped one by one into the furrow gatling couldnt get that process out of his mind its rotating simplicity its smooth mechanical perfection
1236363 gatling had everything he needed the basic mechanical design embodied in his seed planter the moral imperative supplied by the memory of the dead and ailing soldiers as they arrived at the indianapolis train station and the commercial impulse which arose as a possibly awkward but completely predictable consequence of the realization that this might well be a drawn out expensive affair it might last years not months despite all the breezy hypothesizing at the outset and long wars meant large profits for gunmakers
1236364 for a thousand dollars apiece with his own money after the ordnance department had turned down his request for funds
1236365 the only place in which a gatling gun was destined to make an appreciable difference during the civil war wasnt on a battlefield at all it didnt come in the midst of a struggle between competing armies and it would set the tone for the weapons dark reputation later in the century for its grim identification with the forces of oppression and exploitation
1236366 the story foretells the way gatlings guns would be deployed after the war as menacing symbols as icons of sheer destructive ferocity even if they just sat there
1236367 gatling guns were purchased by police departments state militias and factory owners
1236368 tools of domination and intimidation both at home and abroad
1236369 gatling guns became the weapon of choice for british forces determined to enforce colonial rule in africa
1236370 no no no his head was too full of all the things he wanted to build things he thought he could sell thereby building a great fortune he was a restless young man he was brimming with energy and purpose and hope he had caught his countrys peculiar fever there was no cure
1236371 richard gatling and his brothers had followed different rivers as they moved beyond their youth into the world at large but everything eventually would come back to one river the river of the past and it ran as it always does from darkness into light and then into darkness again
1236372 proposed agreement for cooperation in research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy
1236373 get as soon as possible 23 000 megawatts of electricity from nuclear power stations
1236374 irans much publicized nuclear power intentions are entirely in the planning stage
1236375 we believe irans true intent is to develop the capability to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons
1236376 using both the plutonium route supported ultimately by a heavy water research reactor and the highly enriched uranium route supported by a gas centrifuge enrichment plant
1236377 tehrans construction of a gas centrifuge based uranium enrichment facility
1236378 tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons
1236379 absence of confidence pdf that irans nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes
1236380 all we can do to save ourselves in crisis and to grow our business is to make sure that every contract we get we execute flawlessly
1236381 it seemed to me that they had a crisis communications problem without an evident crisis communications strategy they just became radioactive
1236382 theres a real possibility that if blackwater exits the business that some u s officials will receive inferior protection in war zones and deaths will result
1236383 in the military services theres a sentiment that we can do whatever we want because no one serious is looking over our shoulder
1236384 dod acquisition and contracting community continues to face the stress of managing the increasing defense budget with a smaller and less capable workforce
1236385 i cant stress enough what an incredibly open and transparent and rigorous first selection we have gone through
1236386 we have been extremely open and transparent we have had a very thorough review of what were doing weve got it nailed and i dont see any relationship to what has gone on in the past at all
1236387 significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between boeing and northrop
1236388 could refuel all current air force fixed wing tanker compatible receiving aircraft in accordance with current air force procedures as required by the solicitation
1236389 weve not seen a document as scorching as this from an independent nonpolitical agency
1236390 they are essentially saying there is either incompetency in the air force or there was political interference that led them to bend over backwards to benefit one competitor because they feared the power of the purse strings either way the air force procurement system has gone horribly horribly wrong
1236391 it appears that the air force was at minimum trying to overcompensate because of the perception they were too cozy with boeing
1236392 take what the air force has been saying publicly the last four or five months and contrast that with what the gao found and theres almost complete discord
1236393 dss management in place during the transfer of the personnel security investigation function to opm created a lack of accountability for assets posing an undue risk for military civilian and contractor employees who were investigated for security clearances between 1997 and 2005
1236394 escalate the issue to the highest level possible in the government and within his own company
1236395 he did not delete findings from the report and change the draft audit opinion to adequate
1236396 some dcaa supervisors were cutting corners and pressuring their subordinates to give more favorable audits to contractors than the auditors felt the contractors deserved
1236397 this shows a blatant disregard for the safeguards that are supposed to be in place to ensure that contractors charge the government no more than a fair and reasonable price
1236398 will determine what if any of the next appropriate steps will be we have faith in our auditors they are held to high standards
1236399 behold human beings living in a underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have in front of them over which they show the puppets to them i said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images

1236401 we spent many tens of billions of dollars during the apollo era to purchase a commanding lead in space over all nations on earth
1236402 weve been living off the fruit of that purchase for 40 years and have not chosen to invest at a level that would preserve that commanding lead
1236403 why should taxpayers foot the bill to prop up those former giants when the company ceos rake in a bundle and continue to do so
1236404 its privatized profits and socialized risk everyone knows im a strong supporter of freedom and free enterprise but this is ridiculous the lack of accountability and responsibility is astounding
1236405 their work is to crack down crimes and make us safe it is our duty to cooperate with them
1236406 you can not tell us what to do and we can not be taken for granted
1236407 in general americans tend to overestimate the influence china has over north korea
1236408 the idea that the chinese would turn their backs on the north koreans is clearly wrong
1236409 doing just what they have to do and no more
1236410 without risk that the military first policy or regime stability would be undermined by foreign aid policies of other countries
1236411 as an authoritarian regime that reformed they understand what kim jong il is most concerned with survival
1236412 for the chinese stability and the avoidance of war are the top priorities
1236413 from that point of view the north koreans are a huge problem for them because pyongyang could trigger a war on its own
1236414 the chinese are most concerned about the collapse of north korea leading to chaos on the border
1236415 china conceives itself to have the right to make an authoritative interpretation of the principle for intervention
1236416 china now places more value on national interest over alliances blinded by ideology
1236417 mccain likes to say he would rather lose an election than lose a war to this i guess his campaign is now awkwardly adding that he would rather lose an election than have terrorists succeed in another attack the sad part is that now we are having this conversation we can look forward to days of cable news chatter over the issue and meta chatter about who benefits from the chatter is it a dark atwaterian rovian ploy or another embarrassing mccain campaign stumble
1236418 my hope and expectation is that in the years ahead more african americans will staff the armed forces at the highest levels
1236419 we must make sure the american military continues to be a great engine of progress and equality
1236420 they no longer cared whether i was black or white immigrant kid or not
1236421 the only thing my commanders ever told me from 1958 for the rest of my career is can you perform and thats all we have ever asked for
1236422 when you remove the dust you will find a diamond
1236423 iraqis feel sensitive to the presence of foreign troops so of course people will deal differently with iraqi forces

1236430 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks

1236433 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1236434 this is a project that has had significant scrutiny by all the neighbors businesses and residents
1236435 we feel that we have been up front in getting their input
1236436 bob used to be pretty aggressive in his patrol we had a lot of weeds and bushes we didnt send any letters didnt call anybody
1236437 id like to end my stay with the city by saying im from batavia and im proud of it
1236438 where we can gain the advantage is if we resolve the problem first
1236439 if you have an employee who spends 22 minutes getting to a meeting youre paying for those 22 minutes
1236440 anything that moves traffic from highways to arterials is not going to work in this region
1236441 the main objective is to better understand the magnitude of the problem and where its occurring
1236442 the region that solves congestion problems first will have the competitive advantage
1236443 the thing i hate is having a runner on third with less than two outs and not bringing him in
1236444 its an easy rbi but i put together some other good at bats
1236445 guys are beginning to pick it up after the break
1236446 we know theyre not going to hand us the division
1236447 all in all it was kind of ugly in the first inning im human i cant go out there and put up zeros inning after inning
1236448 weve said a lot this year that weve got to pitch better
1236449 once that starts happening there are some really good things on the horizon we know we can score we just let people score too many against us
1236450 his stuff was pretty good but maybe it wasnt the command we were used to seeing
1236451 i was trying to find a way to get on base
1236452 they were playing me way back at third base and that gave me the opportunity to get on
1236453 we were fortunate to get as many runs as we did off dan tonight
1236454 it doesnt happen often so when it does you hope you can shut the other team down
1236455 he was all over he was flirting with a lot of trouble every inning and just couldnt get anything going
1236456 we dont know at this point if it is a self inflicted wound or if by chance this person was shot
1236457 she had told me that her husband had beat her she was severely beaten she was in shock and was hysterical
1236458 it has been discussed but i cant say i was a witness to it
1236459 the information she was giving to 911 it didnt sound like she had any idea that her husband had been short or hurt or anything
1236460 it sounded like her husband had severely beaten her and she wanted him out of the house right now
1236461 she was beaten pretty badly she was beaten very badly
1236462 the left side of her face was swollen the were gouges in her face
1236463 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1236464 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1236465 do we have a cultural issue on that absolutely not
1236466 we have a playing group that lives every day disciplined and focussed on winning a premiership
1236467 people who dont have anything to hide are usually easy to serve
1236468 weve spent a lot of time and effort and a lot of long nights dealing with trying to find out where he is
1236469 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1236470 to be a good christian is to wear the happy face all the time
1236471 but christ healed me of this and the lord took care of that
1236472 christians have never dealt well with the inner darkness of the redeemed
1236473 i have much more to say to you more than you can now bear

1236534 is this appropriate holding my daughter on the couch even though shes butt naked
1236535 dylan kissed me 10 times in a row that lady over there is giving me a dirty look
1236536 our work as a prime contractor has provided significant value to the air force and other government agencies
1236537 we are proud of our track record and work closely with government officials to both meet the needs of the warfighter and comply with the rules and requirements of the contracting process
1236538 routinely violated rules designed to protect u s government interests
1236539 i wouldnt even be able to stand next to her
1236540 most of the innings i felt i had to battle quite a bit they put me to the test petty good
1236541 today is the day when my dream is coming true
1236542 at last i get to finalize the last chapter of my case
1236543 it really feels strange to think that i will see my father for the first time in my life
1236544 i cannot imagine what my father looks like now i will probably be speechless when i see him
1236545 one of the things that we want the workers to know is that yes 2011 may be a few years away however lets start the planning process now lets start the conversations whether you know what you are going to do definitively or not
1236546 its a shock that is certainly true but we think it is a manageable shock
1236547 you know law enforcement is a profession that is very unique
1236548 we owe a lasting debt to those who sacrifice their lives serving or protecting our communities
1236549 it tells us that the community cares about the job we do
1236550 continuing to operate their business as they have will generate a level of growth that will get us the increase in value were hoping to achieve
1236551 this was opportunity driven this is our ninth investment in a government services firm so this isnt a sea change for us
1236552 i think our focus in our transactions is ultimately on the sectors of government services that we find most attractive information technology security intelligence
1236553 my message to the staff is you will see no changes
1236554 this isnt even our problem we do not produce cocaine here but it is destroying our future
1236555 johnson now has a hard act to follow but he comes in as having proven himself at dominion power and as the top leader at the navy one of gds biggest customers
1236556 he created a multimillion dollar it segment from nothing and added eight different models of the gulfstream
1236557 hell be remembered as the one who really built general dynamics into what it is today
1236558 plus there is great outcry from some in the media claiming we are turning over the air force to the french and giving europe a gazillion jobs too nothing could be further from the truth
1236559 this is the public relations equivalent of air cover you saturate debate with your rhetoric so people start talking about your message and stop talking about mccain its a classic third party technique
1236560 the question is what is lobbying and what is campaign intervention
1236561 the difficult issue that arises with these kinds of relationships especially in election years is whether a candidate for public office is benefiting improperly from an organizations activity
1236562 you can screw up a lot of things in the airline industry but you have to have fleet simplification
1236563 and by having a consistent manufacturer and supplier it gives you that opportunity
1236564 in a network of this size you really do need to be able to optimize the airplane to the route
1236565 they will have higher operating costs not lower operating costs
1236566 the combined airline will have a fleet that contains every airplane that has ever been manufactured that is one of the realities the more types of airplanes you have the higher your costs
1236567 we didnt have any losses on contracts no delivery misses
1236568 the technical milestones were accomplished on track all of the things you look at from a report card perspective we did
1236569 we do everything from floor waxing to repairing vehicles to accounting to logistics operations to running grocery stores
1236570 about 3 billion more than germany spends on its entire defense budget
1236571 when you get to this level pretty much everything that walks through your door is going to be a problem
1236572 so what you have to have is a mind set to be a problem solver and figure out a corrective action plan
1236573 we look at our numbers and say were not doing too hot today or what are we doing about this problem that is emerging
1236574 it drives me a bit crazy when people say the departments books are all messed up and we dont know what the heck is going on
1236575 so at least we are trying to change the culture and we think weve made some good progress
1236576 i was aware of the fact that he was going to organize something for some saic employees who wanted to be supportive
1236577 individuals dont lose their ability to talk to their friends and colleagues at work including asking them to vote for a favorite candidate
1236578 but the more broadly hes soliciting people that maybe he knows only slightly and if hes clearly using a corporate list i think that is a fact that shows this isnt his personal political activity
1236579 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema

1236617 there are two brothers one of them stays in his cell quietly fasting for six days at a time and imposing on himself a good deal of discipline and the other serves the sick which one of them is more acceptable to god
1236618 if i pray to god that all people might be inspired because of me i would find myself repenting at the door of every house i would rather pray that my heart be pure toward everybody
1236619 no i am the same inside as i am outside

1236623 the recent lift in agricultural prices will give the nation a step up on the medal podium and assist the rebalancing process the economy is embarking on as growth swings from the spending to the earning sectors
1236624 those are two of the areas that we want to try to build from our existing base of business
1236625 its part of a broader trend for government outsourcing increasingly its difficult for the government to recruit and retain the kind of people that do this work its just an inevitability theyre going to be relying more on outside companies
1236626 it was an unexpected move on the part of dyncorp that appeared fairly abrupt
1236627 lanese had brought with him a level of street savvy that had given investors some degree of confidence and dyncorp had captured some very nice business wins under his leadership
1236628 a guy like bill is somebody who could be with the company for 20 years who could build us into a world class operation
1236629 while religious affiliation should certainly not be a determining factor dod has a responsibility to closely scrutinize any company under consideration before contracts are awarded
1236630 i am concerned that such scrutiny did not occur in this case and that funds from this company may have been used to support the flds churchs activities
1236631 our contracts are based on competition in the business world and the business goes and pays its costs and its labor and works hard for the money
1236632 if they choose us its because we make good parts on time
1236633 we are the worlds largest and most complex organization with a budget of nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars
1236634 there are more government contractors than federal employees in the 11th district
1236635 i voted against the surge but its low hanging fruit to go after a contractor in a war zone some of these contractors are heroes we have more contractors in iraq than soldiers
1236636 everybody has to make a decision about what kinds of companies theyre going to invest in what kind of companies theyre going to have stock in
1236637 the hypocrisy i think is the thing that is the most troublesome
1236638 im not trying to make the world easier for my employer
1236639 im trying to lay out a principled position irrespective of what my employer might do i dont support war profiteering and i dont support large noncompetitive contracts i dont think theyre healthy i dont think they help the system if that happens to hurt my employers so be it
1236640 gerry connolly works as part of saics community relations team in this role he is not involved in saics work for government or commercial clients

1236643 possibly the most uniquely canadian book ive seen in several years is habeeb salloums arab cooking on a saskatchewan homestead recipes and recollections from the canadian plains research centre at the university of regina salloums parents emigrated to canada from syria in the early 1920s and settled in saskatchewan he grew up as a prairie farm kid joined the rcaf for world war ii then worked for the federal government for thirty six years before retiring to a third career as a freelance historian writer and on the evidence presented in the book a food lover as cookbooks go this is the real deal for people who like middle eastern cuisine but it is a lot more than merely a cookbook it is also a fine piece of cultural history written by a man about equally rooted in arab and canadian culture in agricultural and nutritional science and most firmly in saskatchewans history of rural immigration it is therefore a useful book on several grounds
1236644 with their food syrian immigrants were 100 years ahead of their time he says he sent in the unsolicited cookbook manuscript to the university of reginas canadian plains research center and crossed his fingers if it had been a straight up cookbook we wouldnt have published it its the recollection part that interested us

1236646 i reached for the arm that had the gun and a shot went off i dont know how it transpired
1236647 i wasnt sure if i got shot he got shot or who got shot
1236648 my son doesnt have a hot temper ive always instilled in him that trouble is easy to get into and hard to get out of
1236649 when i arrived on the scene we knew there was a suspect that was todd dolin

1236655 the santoku b ch or japan its unshouldered blade which is typically between five and eight inches long has a flat edge and a sheepsfoot blade which curves in an angle approaching 60 degrees at the point the top of the santokus handle is in line with the top of the blade giving the chefs fingers plenty of room underneath the word santoku loosely translates as three good things or three uses a reference to the knifes multipurpose utility slicing dicing and mincing the santokus blade and handle are carefully designed to work in harmony by matching the blades width weight to the weight of blade tang and handle and the original japanese santoku is an especially well balanced knife
1236656 marshmallows kit fresh marshmallows are the best and when you make your own you can eat them as fresh as fresh can be the world of vegan cuisine is littered with the shattered corpses of those who tried to veganise marshmallows aint that the truth bcg just replace the gelatine blerrgh with agar not so simple now angel food takes the angst out of the situation with our new make your own vegan marshmallows kit it contains all the specialist ingredients for making about 50 good sized drool worthy marshies plus the recipe of course you just need to add sugar water syrup vanilla essence and starch or coconut and youre away the kits are only available by mail order and online purchase and yes we ship world wide
1236657 my son mack and i have actually toasted the marshies on a beach over a tiny little fire tucked into a rock shelf they were more delicate than i remember standard marshies being when toasted but they did crust on the outside and melt in the middle
1236658 sausage slices and brown briefly add the remaining ingredients and simmer for about 10 minutes or until the flavors are mixed
1236659 it makes sense the long slow rise does over hours what intensive kneading does in minutes it brings the gluten molecules into side by side alignment to maximize their opportunity to bind to each other and produce a strong elastic network the wetness of the dough is an important piece of this because the gluten molecules are more mobile in a high proportion of water and so can move into alignment easier and faster than if the dough were stiff

1236661 one persons life is just a drop in the bucket
1236662 we supply the flying fleet the 17 000 planes that use our parts
1236663 we also make all the components pilots monitor touch and turn
1236664 on fighters and bombers we provide stealth materials that can withstand extremes in temperature
1236665 the real key is the increasing age of the worldwide aviation fleet esterline is positioned to benefit since it supplies so many parts
1236666 our development program is at the heart of what occurs here where we are in the business of engaging the brains of our workforce
1236667 because of how we involve and motivate people we have a continual flow of new products

1236670 the fact is the american gi today doesnt have the best weapon and they ought to
1236671 theres not a weapon out there thats significantly better than the m4

1236675 the savings and vehicles not lost because of reduced violence
1236676 while the u s military considered aligning with iraqi tribes soon after the war began
1236677 marrying women to strangers let alone foreigners is just not done
1236678 theres a lot of distrust in the government for the sunnis
1236679 the potential for infiltration by insurgents the possibility of distortions in the local economy if salaries are not carefully managed and the need for a comprehensive plan to transition sons of iraq to sustainable forms of employment in the iraqi security forces or in the private sector
1236680 thats why they are putting so much effort into targeting awakening members
1236681 it is safe to say that sons of iraq members have been targeted for attacks because of their effectiveness in providing security for their areas of responsibility
1236682 the sunnis want to resume their place where they hold the preponderance of power and to do that they have to fight to get it the shia conversely want to crush them
1236683 the reactor which was being built was not very far from being operational and needed to be hit
1236684 we judged that these interactions were probably nuclear related because of who it was we were seeing in those interactions
1236685 we assessed the cooperation involved work sites probably within syria but again we didnt know exactly where
1236686 if this company conducts business with syria the terms of transactions would abide by and would be within the legal framework of the international community
1236687 it is best when first combined with dry ingredients before adding liquid it will begin to swell or thicken as soon as it is added to water milk or juices it will impart a smooth short texture when fully hydrated reaching its full thickness within 5 10 minutes without requiring any cooking instant clearjel can be used in cooking as well the viscosity will increase slightly upon heating it has excellent heat and acid resistance and can be used in acid containing foods and in those applications where heating is required it has good cold temperature storage stability making it particularly well suited for refrigerated and frozen foods

1236708 gluey potatoes are a result of starch granules that swell with water and then burst during cooking releasing a gel that turns potatoes sticky cooking the potatoes with their skins on protects the starch granules reducing the gumminess to give peeled potatoes the same protection they were avoiding the need to peel freshly cooked hot potatoes before mashing bcg we made two alterations to our usual technique steaming rather than boiling the potatoes exposes the potato pieces to less water reducing the chance of the granules swelling to the point of bursting some granules however will inevitably burst rinsing the potatoes midway through cooking removes the resultant gel as a bonus we found that this method requires less butter and dairy to achieve the same richness as conventional mashed potatoes

1236710 she reminded the rank and file here not only do we matter but were an equal branch of government and she reminded the president were no longer a cheap date
1236711 shes got a hot hand right now we want to make sure she keeps that momentum going
1236712 i think that the president has finally realized that the leverage has changed
1236713 that is the question who has the leverage i think the president realizes now that we do
1236714 the iraqi government has been grotesquely irresponsible with the money we have given them

1236725 it didnt have a typical plot or really any plot at all we had a great story and it was well structured but not much of a plot by hollywood standards

1236727 arent exactly losers but men who missed the brass ring for one reason or another some for lack of talent others for some deep seated character flaw they hang on searching for what ron shelton calls the defining moment that justifies a lifetime of chasing a dream

1236730 stand up paddling a variation of surfing in which you stand on a board and propel with a paddle almost like a kayak
1236731 to change ocean recreation much as snowboards changed the ski slopes
1236732 one of the best big wave surfers ever having taken on waves up to 80 feet high
1236733 rather than springing up on a board and being propelled at high speed behind a breaking wave stand up paddling is more akin to standing on a kayak it can be enjoyed without mastering the hardest part of surfing popping up from a prone position and actually catching the wave
1236734 you get yahoos who think they can act like one of the guys
1236735 surfing was never a team sport now its the herd

1236762 i want to see jellyfish make it because im bored with what alternative rock has become dreary dull dim witted and way too inbred jellyfish flogs a different set of influences and for that alone its refreshing in an era of pop underachievers these dandies are ambitious and accomplished beyond the fun of hearing my early teen record collection shoved through a cuisinart i get off on the urgency of jellyfish these iconoclasts sing and play with tuneful desperation as if theyll burst into flames if they dont get that forgotten move riff just right
1236763 they were a great band one of the best ive ever seen

1236767 one could sniff and dismiss jellyfishs bellybutton as ahem derivative just another album in the fab four through squeeze through crowded house milieu but its not
1236768 all of those influences and more are plainly evident but these songs are so melodically delightful the sweet and sour vocal harmonies so tangy the arrangements so artfully crafted that bellybutton adds up to exalted pop no matter if some of it strikes as a tad familiar
1236769 the sticky type of soluble fiber found in oats barley and beans and certain vegetables such as okra and eggplant viscous fibers help binding the cholesterol in your digestive tract and sweep it out of your body in another word soluble fiber act as a sponge absorbing cholesterol and carrying it out of your system people at less developed countries such as china are less prone to having high blood cholesterol because their diet are high on viscous fiber
1236770 its essentially a sponge ready to absorb anything and its packed with water this one two punch transforms the eggplant into oil soaked mush before it has a chance to caramelize
1236771 the solution first we needed to dehydrate the eggplant but the traditional salting method didnt sufficiently dry it out combining salting and microwaving did work after we put a few disposable coffee filters under the eggplant to keep it from poaching in its leached out liquid the eggplant now reduced to a third its original size could be saut ed in a much smaller amount of oil 1 tablespoon vs nearly 1 2 cup the eggplant plumped up nicely when added back to the other vegetables to stew absorbing these other flavors instead of just oil

1236778 the argument for going to war with iraq was based on intelligence that we now know was inaccurate the information the american people were hearing from the president and that i was being given by our intelligence community wasnt the whole story had i known this at the time i never would have voted for this war
1236779 and the same polls that youre talking about if you look at the general election match ups show very clearly that im the strongest democrat to beat the republicans in the general election
1236780 the polls do seem to suggest a structural advantage for democrat candidates against republicans at this early stage
1236781 but there are no consistent reliable data showing edwards with a better chance than other democrats
1236782 the idea of setting up a public plan to compete with private plans has been thoroughly discredited
1236783 no matter what regulations are established private plans will continue to select the healthy especially the healthy workforce and their healthy families the private plans cover the majority of us who are healthy and cost very little while as taxpayers we pay most of the costs for health care for those with medical needs

1236788 and as the incandescent light bulbs the electrician installed in our fixtures burn out we are replacing them with fluorescent bulbs i cannot tell without checking which of our bulbs are still incandescent and which are now and will continue to be fluorescent switching is a little bit of a bite because the bulbs are more expensive

1236790 i wasnt praying i wasnt seeking his advice and counsel i wasnt always looking to him saying as i pray to do his will and not my own i became more interested in my own desires and will than his will

1236795 hedge funds are investment pools that are relatively unconstrained in what they do they are relatively unregulated for now charge very high fees will not necessarily give you your money back when you want it and will generally not tell you what they do they are supposed to make money all the time and when they fail at this their investors redeem and go to someone else who has recently been making money
1236796 lt gen douglas lutes recent statement that the bush administration is considering a draft reveals the true danger of the administrations breathtaking failures in iraq and around the world
1236797 president bush is floating the idea of a draft that would send more young americans to iraq
1236798 one of the things we ought to be thinking about is some level of mandatory service to our country so that everybody in america not just the poor kids who get sent to war are serving this country we have people from all walks of life in america who are serving including reservists and national guard what we want to do is to have all americans to have a chance to serve their country
1236799 i did and i came after after the time that they were actually drafting from the lottery
1236800 while they were on the ground fighting they lobbied the congress to cut their combat pay this is the height of hypocrisy

1236802 no me parece bien que la gente se entretenga a costa del sufrimiento de estos animales que en la mayor a de los casos viven en p simas condiciones los circos y espect culos pueden ser igualmente atractivos sin necesidad de tener animales que viven hacinados y alejados de su h bitat natural y que en muchos casos son maltratados

1236809 we feel that we got our work in in terms of innings pitched with the pitchers
1236810 ive answered a few questions where are guys going to play or how our lineup is going to look weve still got a lot of time to be sitting back these guys are ready theyre ready to play so from that standpoint being healthy is our main issue
1236811 thats what you want to do in baseball get on them early and force the issue and make them have to play catch up
1236812 hopefully well continue to do that i think weve got a good group of guys to do either or
1236813 i dont know if i would use the phrase higher
1236814 we will be going into these games doing things different in terms of pre games preparation from those we have in the past
1236815 we started earlier with a number of new olympic preparation programs that really are built on our learning from turin and our learning from otp
1236816 there have been individuals throughout history alex baumann is a great example victor davis is a great example greg joy is a great example lots of people have been that outspoken about wanting to win in the past
1236817 i think the biggest problem if there is a problem with speaking out like that is that canadians think its a strong stance
1236818 often people say yeah i want to win a medal because they think its bad to say i want to win theres nothing wrong with that thats what competition is all about
1236819 we will get the medals that we get and people will prepare with the resources that we have
1236820 we can say i only believe in gold im here for gold none of that matters if you prepared properly and you execute properly and your potential is to win you will win it wont depend on whether you said you were going to do your best or promised gold
1236821 weve had unfortunately a lot of injuries in the last two years

1236830 i want to explain something i am not afraid of anything i was willing to die for this democracy and for justice that is why i respect it today so i expect those in it the judiciary to respect my rights but let me not go on because i dont want to be accused of threatening them
1236831 we shall not be intimidated by anyone we have rights the president zuma is entitled to go to court to defend those rights
1236832 justice does not start when one appears before a judge it starts with how one is investigated and whether ones rights have been abused
1236833 the anc president has been persecuted by the media and tried in the court of public opinion for well over seven years we want the charges dropped in 2006 they were chucked out of this very court now the npa has come up with new charges one which includes issues of taxation yet the south african revenue service is not even the complainant the other charge relates to racketeering which involves jacob zumas daughter having a r10 car wash lets face it the npa has tried to use public opinion against jacob zuma
1236834 some in the npa used to drop off information at media houses about the investigation into the anc president

1236845 i had never done drugs didnt have any tattoos and i had no symptoms other than being tired but tests showed i was one step short of having cirrhosis of the liver i decided to get treated right away
1236846 it did nothing except to make me sick every weekend for nearly a year
1236847 its a huge relief i thought i was going to have to live with this for the rest of my life maybe get a liver transplant i only wish the drug had been available sooner
1236848 there are a lot of people out there for whom the standard treatments arent working
1236849 we are emotional people and all these ads play on that nerve sometimes they go the extra mile of using a quranic verse
1236850 my appearance is the most important thing in my life
1236851 the patients i examined used creams that allegedly treat hair loss they did not witness any progress though there was no harm done
1236852 we dont have to wait till the damage is done
1236853 the medicine was neither registered in the ministry of health nor sold in the pharmacies so we closed his facility
1236854 the consumer must be aware before using any medicine and the media should refrain from advertising any bogus products regardless of the profit
1236855 they should help increase the awareness of the consumer rather than opening the door for frauds
1236856 most of the influence occurs among low income social classes well off and highly educated people go to famous doctors and buy expensive products
1236857 we cant take action unless a complaint is filed by the consumer
1236858 in that case she took us to the beauty centre and we took the owner to the prosecutor generals office
1236859 people escape conventional medicine because they believe that these phony medicines have no side effects because the advertiser claims it is 100 per cent herbal
1236860 patients with chronic diseases are hopeless and are eager for anything with a radical effect
1236861 in the rural parts of egypt many people tend to rely on these kinds of so called medicines
1236862 these things are serious because they use hormones and since the bottle usually doesnt have a leaflet we dont know the sources or the ingredients
1236863 housewives are a main target for advertisers especially in less privileged societies where morning tv is the favoured by advertisers
1236864 it raises the issue how much of how we feel how much of who we are as people is dictated in terms of our immune system
1236865 a little depressed behavior is a survival mechanism in that sense
1236866 one of my most positive patients had been battling cancer for years yet four weeks into the cytokine therapy she was distraught
1236867 she told me i love my husband and my children but i dont want to be around them
1236868 depression was the first sign we had that an animal was sick
1236869 people would call in and say that the dog is sleeping more than usual they give the dog its favorite treat and it only nibbles at it and then drops it or theyd say the cat looks scruffy
1236870 while in the cave the organism rests but keeps one eye open
1236871 its a good thing if youre running from a tiger
1236872 youd want to rev up your immune system to prepare for an injury
1236873 the fact that stress can activate the innate immune response has been a major breakthrough
1236874 among other things we see a drop in levels of serotonin the feel good chemical
1236875 would provoke a high rate of side effects mainly gastrointestinal pain and possibly bleeding
1236876 the further upstream you go towards the cytokines the more far reaching the effects on the body if you move downstream to block cells that are activated by the inflammation you may have a drug that is less toxic
1236877 the evidence is clear at this point that inflammation events can lead to a depressed mood
1236878 ideally there could be a drug where one size fits all but that doesnt seem to be the case
1236879 we want to bring to peoples attention the interaction between factors
1236880 people who dont respond to those therapies seem to have increased levels of inflammatory markers
1236881 from inflammation to sickness and depression when the immune system subjugates the brain
1236882 the evidence is clear at this point that inflammation events can lead to a depressed mood the issue is how often this is the case
1236883 you know what secret agents do when they come into your house at night this is what happens you got up for a midnight snack and youre getting milk out of the fridge for some reason when men get up in the middle of the night theyre always wearing a robe and pajamas and then they go to the kitchen and they get milk and someone shoots them in the neck with one of those darts
1236884 so i think this is kind of the beginning of the end
1236885 there are currently eight not counting you on the short list who call and email me several times a day ann renee sally julia leslie marta shannon and how many licks your the only one i actually have asked out and have seen i stick to only one person at a time and lucky you your it right now

1236887 top of the day old chum howz life treating you
1236888 there are two great days in a persons life the day we are born amp the day we find out why
1236889 pray that your loneliness may spur you into finding something to live for great enough to die for
1236890 to fear love is to fear life amp those who fear life are already three parts dead
1236891 theres no hum drum in him nor any shilly shally
1236892 next when we are describing a shape or sound or tin dont state the matter plainly but put it in a hint and learn to look at all things with a sort of mental squint
1236893 for instance if i wished sir of mutton pies to tell should i say dreams of fleecy flocks pent in a wheaten cell
1236894 then fourthly there are epithets that suit with any word as well asharveys reading sauce with fish or flesh or bird of these wild lonely weary strange are much to be preferred

1236907 he said would it be acceptable for me to be buried next to bill
1236908 they practiced medicine the same way their interests were the same their politics were the same they agreed on everything
1236909 the doctor told my son get the family together they thought i was a goner
1236910 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1236911 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
1236912 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
1236913 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
1236914 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
1236915 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
1236916 between cash and firm commitments were several million past that
1236917 this long primary campaign was very difficult and about a month ago month and a half ago we finally got a candidate so its night and day
1236918 we dont have all the money yet so were still raising money but we are in terms of firm commitments that were sure of were well past our original contract obligation
1236919 partly to make this a great convention that really reflects well on the city
1236920 theres no place in the constitution where it says the federal government should be involved in the education of children
1236921 i really think that i dont trust the federal government in this role
1236922 id like to see no child left behind ultimately repealed
1236923 the federal government which cant balance its own budget has no business teaching high school students math
1236924 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters and make them look as if they are somehow criminal or somehow going to engage in some kind of gross conduct
1236925 our intent for this bill is not about suppressing or chilling first amendment rights
1236926 the only feces that im concerned about is the expletive that comes out of his mouth
1236927 were a law abiding group and if a bottle of urine is going to be illegal we need to turn it in somewhere
1236928 i think some people are just going to talk about how foolish the ordinance is and i think some people will want to have like a symbolic showing of how foolish it is
1236929 the ordinance would make it illegal to carry items such as chains padlocks and noxious substances such as buckets of urine and so called feces bombs if the intent is to use them to obstruct streets sidewalks buildings or emergency equipment or hinder crowd control measures
1236930 ok sir place the mt dew on the ground and take 2 steps back sir please step away from the dew

1236975 youve got to do it yourself to get the experience
1236976 the bad guys are still out there and i have to prepare them to be in that mental state of mind
1236977 i want to complete that mission and come home with me and my men
1236978 to me its just more of an honor to go
1236979 this is my second family this is what we do
1236980 i always wanted to do it i wanted that experience
1236981 i just wanted to say i was an active participant in the freedoms me and my family enjoy
1236982 we are very proud of them but youre scared youre nervous you worry about them every day
1236983 what have you been doing whatever is tell me your secret
1236984 um i broke up with my boyfriend and have been subsisting on brie and sparks and ive gone dancing seven hours a week
1236985 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1236986 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1236987 obviously any programme to improve services is welcome because they have got an awful lot of work to do
1236988 among commuters and other rail users there is a loss of confidence in network rail to deliver we are going to have to wait and see and hope that they can deliver on these plans
1236989 for me this highlights the fact that if you set your sites high and really want to achieve your goal any obstacle can be overcome
1236990 everybody that sat around the table really really wanted it to happen irrespective of their politics or their position and that was crucial suffolk homes
1236991 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1236992 playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on me but its nothing to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1236993 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1236994 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time
1236995 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed
1236996 my mum found out and it was only then that i thought this is it now im at a crossroads in my life where i can either continue in this spiral or i can get out
1236997 i had family problems and was in trouble with the police i didnt go to school for six or seven months and when i was there i messed around
1236998 then i got expelled from college for causing trouble in the class when i started working things were different i was talking to people all day and found it really stimulating
1236999 when i was in the gym people came to me for advice
1237000 i wanted to take on more responsibilities but the fact i didnt have an education got in the way
1237001 this is a one team approach to policing in manchester where councillors fire services police and many other organisations come together to make the streets and the city a safer place
1237002 the focus is on reducing crime and the fear of crime and to do that we need to be in contact with communities
1237003 this hasnt just come out of thin air it has come from lots of people working together and playing their part
1237004 its about people retaking ownership of their communities people can come to us and voice their concerns over crime and behaviour in their communities
1237005 anti social behaviour is a big problem and it can ruin peoples quality of life
1237006 its important to keep ahead of the game and make sure young people dont get lured into the trap of gang culture and the habit of carrying knives for protection or whatever reason
1237007 ive travelled in parts of europe where graffiti is an accepted art form we can learn from that because we still treat graffiti artists the same as paedophiles and murderers and send them to jail
1237008 so many people helped me and now i want to help others
1237009 the other work ive been doing with the workshops has been amazing you see quiet uncomfortable kids really get with it after 30 minutes and forget other problems for a couple of hours
1237010 its about getting them to be creative and using graffiti in a positive way ive not done any graffiti crime for two years and now im trying to put a positive spin on a negative situation
1237011 if you were like that when we were together this shit would have never happened
1237012 youve got to have a friend even the worst of man has friends even the hangman has friends
1237013 were gonna make it alone we dont need anyone lord knows we dont need you
1237014 the east of england co operative society already provides the breast screening service with sites at felixstowe leiston and stowmarket and has been extremely helpful by coming to our aid again
1237015 by providing us with parking space and services in framlingham women will not have to travel to woodbridge or leiston for this important and potentially life saving service
1237016 the future of the service which helps around 500 women each year was under threat until the co operative society came forward
1237017 the service remains very grateful for english heritages support for the last 19 years
1237018 following a public appeal for help the service received more than 20 offers of alternative sites and although most of these proved unsuitable it was heartened by the support of the community
1237019 we do need affordable homes for those young people who want to live here and stay in this area but certainly not 1 700 new houses
1237020 i think we have a duty to preserve this land for future generations to enjoy
1237021 there are huge benefits from swallowing hard and looking at the bigger picture
1237022 the danger with small amounts here there and everywhere is that you build ever more remote from existing shops and town with less chance to get significant sums of money to solve some of the problems and create a new and better place
1237023 there is a good case for doing the difficult thing in the short term for the long term quality you create
1237024 i am very keen on a fully designed development on one site with the infrastructure provided as i do believe that is the best way forward for the future population of felixstowe
1237025 that figure set by the government is a minimum figure it is not a ceiling which should not be exceeded
1237026 we have got to identify a 15 year supply of land which is ready for this development
1237027 there is not enough brownfield sites we cannot be speculative we must show that land has been identified and is available for the homes which need to be built
1237028 these standards are very bad which is why the nut will not accept that it is reasonable and fair on our children to allow such things to happen
1237029 nobody should be allowed to teach in classrooms without appropriate training and qualifications
1237030 our policy is that every class and every lesson should be taught by a qualified teacher assisted by a properly trained and qualified teaching assistant
1237031 they are being exploited once they are there you can ask them to do other duties a teacher needs to do and that is clearly not fair
1237032 i think it is wrong that teachers are substituted with non qualified teachers but it is currently symptomatic of a problem with the education system as a whole
1237033 councils are awarded for not spending money and so are schools and recruitment is one area that may be cut back
1237034 childrens education is definitely suffering because an instructor has to learn how to teach on the job unless they are taken away for a few weeks on a course kids will get a second rate education
1237035 i knew i was not giving as full an education to them as a qualified teacher would but if i left they would have just replaced me with another instructor and i didnt feel bad because at least i knew i was trying my hardest
1237036 i got the impression that details of how i was getting on were trickled back through to management but i was rarely approached and received no offers of training
1237037 the few times i felt appreciated it came from other members of low level staff or people who helped me out because they wanted to not because it was their job without these handful of people i would not have lasted a month
1237038 all school staff employed to have regular responsibility for a class in a school will need to satisfy the headteacher that they can provide a suitably stimulating and rigorous experience for their pupils
1237039 those staff without graduate teacher status are appropriately supervised and supported with planning and preparation all schools are inspected by ofsted
1237040 schools may well employ instructors in areas of teaching where recruitment is problematic this is a national situation
1237041 oh god its martha time so you have to stop so i can go to work school

1237055 i am one of those people who is prepared to die for the liberation of this country for justice in this country for the judiciary of this country which i so much respect
1237056 i hope those in the judiciary will also respect it if they want us to respect it they must also respect it
1237057 the anc now has to show that they respect the constitution and the law they have to stop trying to delay this trial
1237058 they have to stop attacking the constitutional court and the constitution and understand that without the rule of law we are nothing
1237059 mr zuma must face his day in court and stop trying to suppress the evidence
1237060 hipster the dead end of western civilization is the new cover story from adbusters if youre not familiar adbusters is a fun angry starbucks hating publication whose credo states that weve all been brainwashed by advertising and mass media into an orgy of overconsumption that lets the american empire destroy the rest of the world to feed our fat faces i buy it at whole foods

1237072 during the beijing olympic games one large scale cultural event would be held each day at tiananmen square

1237080 nous nous attendons ce que les prix poursuivent leur baisse
1237081 it was a little sore on the outside of the ankle but i was able to run a little better than i was when i pinch hit
1237082 if needed in an emergency i think i could play i just told labossiere the head athletic trainer it was sore on the outside and he said thats a good thing
1237083 he thought it was more straight ahead on my ankle instead of my outside when i was running thats how i felt
1237084 i had hoped hed be back but hes not there yet
1237085 we had hoped on that friday that hed actually get out to play and he just didnt feel 100 percent so well keep going day by day with him
1237086 thats the plant foot for him when he hits its the front foot so thats the one you plant and you hit off of that front side a little bit and then thats your first step that right ankle when you steal base so its a little bit difficult i know you got to be close to 100 percent hopefully hell get that way before this road trip is over for sure in the next two or three days we can run him out there
1237087 i just got a bruised thigh a deep thigh bruise or whatever its just a football injury
1237088 id have to move hunter to center if something happened
1237089 you can go with lance in right or newhan or go with ty those are the three options we have i would be ok with one of those guys going out there
1237090 it kind of limits me sometimes defensively because i cant make a defensive move maybe in the late innings with lee
1237091 although carlos has played awfully well i mean he really has it seems like hes been much more aggressive in the outfield playing that wall and digging balls out of that corner hes done a real good job
1237092 if it doesnt get any better here pretty soon yeah well have to do something
1237093 because it does kind of limit you what you can do i was almost the other day tempted to use newhan hes played a little bit in the outfield it even crossed my mind to use lance
1237094 it would be a little bit unfair to put him out there after not playing all year in the outfield i even thought about ty a couple of times because tys played left and right heck he hasnt played the outfield this year it ties your hands up a little bit so hopefully the next two or three days hell be fine
1237095 sometimes you have this feeling that a matchup kind of suits one or the other a little bit
1237096 my plan had been to hit blum because hes so good against this guy dempster but ty swung it so good yesterday this things kind of bases a little bit on merit on our guys swinging so i got to get him an opportunity to swing

1237113 these are things that we can build on to make an olympic bid successful

1237302 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
1237303 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
1237304 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
1237305 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
1237306 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
1237307 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
1237308 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
1237309 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
1237310 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
1237311 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
1237312 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
1237313 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
1237314 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
1237315 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
1237316 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
1237317 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
1237318 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
1237319 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
1237320 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
1237321 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

1237328 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1237329 since speaker pelosi has decided not to keep the house in session to allow this vote to take place we urge you to use the power vested in you by the constitution to convene an immediate energy special session of congress
1237330 when confronted with a misguided democrat majority party and speaker pelosi who ignored the will of the people and adjourned the house for a five week vacation without addressing the most important issue of our day the rising price of gasoline we felt it important to organize a number of our colleagues to commit to take advantage of their right and speak for five minutes on this injustice
1237331 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1237336 accessmyhealth org is a great opportunity for washingtonians to learn about the benefits of having their health information online in a very secure manner and to inform us of what they would find worthwhile
1237337 the evergreen state is taking a leadership role to learn from the prospective users of online health records be they patients doctors or consumers that are ready to take charge of their own health
1237338 we encourage anyone in the state of washington to take our online surveys
1237339 weve got the questions and washingtonians have the answers the state legislature and the health care authority are providing strong vision and creating opportunities to test the promise of personalized online health records but to do it well we have to find out what privacy and security measures are important to washingtonians how will doctors and patients benefit from such access

1237343 the fbi removed computer records from the c burr artz library this week a library official confirmed saturday darrell batson director of frederick county public libraries said two fbi employees came to the downtown frederick library either wednesday or thursday the agents removed two public computers from the librarys second floor they told him they were taking the units back to their office in washington d c batson said batson expected the computers would be returned early this week he said debbie weierman spokeswoman for the fbis washington field office would not comment saturday on whether the agency had removed records from the library this was the third time in his 10 years with fcpl that the fbi has come to the library seeking records batson said it was the first time they came without a court order the librarys procedure for such requests usually requires a court order however after the agent described the case and the situation he was persuaded to give them access batson said
1237344 without a court order neither the fbi nor local law enforcement has authority to compel cooperation with an investigation or require answers to questions other than the name and address of the person speaking to the agent or officer if the agent or officer persists or makes an appeal to patriotism the library director should explain that as good citizens the library staff will not respond to informal requests for confidential information in conformity with professional ethics first amendment freedoms and state law if the agent or officer presents a search warrant or other judicial process the library director should immediately call the librarys counsel and ask for assistance
1237345 these kinds of things happen in other parts of the world too and of course it will naturally have a psychological effect on tourists
1237346 but i think this is an individual incident at the same time there has been no fundamental change to the fact that we are basically a safe travel destination
1237347 i believe that through stepping up our work we can get the message across once again that china is safe and good value
1237348 we must release news in a timely way to ensure people know the real situation
1237349 there has definitely been an increase in the volume of harassment and now weve seen an increase in the stakes of the violence that theyre willing to spread in the name of this cause
1237350 but as far as who did it and whether theyre the same people thats something that only time and investigation will determine
1237351 we do have some viable leads that were working on
1237352 one cannot claim to be an animal protection advocate and threaten violence against other people even if we disagree with what they are doing
1237353 this behavior is antithetical to the core principles of the humane movement
1237354 if animal abusers arent going to stop perpetrating these types of atrocities they ought to be stopped using whatever means necessary what were starting to see is the implementation of that type of strategy
1237355 its change its pressure to make you clear my dear
1237356 youre right the problem is not that axes exist but perhaps we
1237357 there is no better evidence that individual privacy simply does not exist in googles world than by the chilling amount of detailed visual information google now collects on all of us information that any internet user can now compile in a dossier in less than 30 minutes
1237358 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice there isnt any privacy get over it
1237359 perhaps in googles world privacy does not exist but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
1237360 we just touched the surface of the potential on the web
1237361 now we need to turn up the volume and to get more people involved explore what the future could look like and inspire us to do it
1237362 we are trying to make peoples interaction with the technology more natural and more physical
1237363 some of these things are right around the corner and some will take another 10 years to unfold
1237364 traditionally you would have to submit code but now you can just bring an idea even a sketch on a piece of paper
1237365 they are trying to show that they are taking the leadership of the designers and they are looking to innovate in the areas where there is still room for innovation
1237366 it has been a very static area there is not a lot more that you can do in terms of the functionality but there is always something that can be done about the look and feel of the browser and thats where the public is always happy to see changes

1237398 if you look at the month on month change this would be a more modest increase in the annual inflation rate compared with the big jumps in previous months

1237402 new catalyst marks major step in the march toward hydrogen fuel
1237403 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1237404 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1237405 developed an unprecedented process that will allow the suns energy to be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases
1237406 combined with another catalyst such as platinum that can produce hydrogen gas from water
1237407 in a revolutionary leap that could transform solar power from a marginal boutique alternative into a mainstream energy source
1237408 mit researchers have overcome a major barrier to large scale solar power storing energy for use when the sun doesnt shine
1237409 within 10 years homeowners will be able to power their homes in daylight through photovoltaic cells while using excess solar energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen to power their own household fuel cell
1237410 the cpi m party office is a favourite haunt for drug addicts alcoholics sex workers and a hideout for criminals since there is no place to accommodate natural calamity victims the ngo will use it for the purpose
1237411 after receiving several complaints about the activities taking place in that office we checked the municipal records and found out that the construction had no valid documents neither had any rent been paid therefore i as vice chairman of the municipality have issued a notification to the ic sadar police station who would forward it to the district magistrate and the superintendent of police the darjeeling municipality chairman has been notified too
1237412 if the administration does not grant permission we would file a mass petition before the district magistrate and other concerned authorities
1237413 the building is a government property and though no rent was being paid the party was contemplating on taking it on lease

1237425 hello all this is a little story i came up from based on some actual insomnia induced hallucinations
1237426 we applied with the games organizers to order an extra long bed after the good luck beijing test events in april
1237427 back then all the clinical beds here were just 2 1 meters long and were very uncomfortable for the patients
1237428 of course we hope no one gets injured and all the athletes play well at the games
1237429 the combination of limos transparent governance model balanced development model and extensive mobile industry heritage sets it apart and has garnered strong industry support and engagement
1237430 this next wave of limo handsets points to the innovation that will flow as the industry coalesces on the limo platform
1237431 limo was founded on the notion that fragmentation of the mobile industry among dozens of proprietary closed operating systems was inhibiting innovation
1237432 with such a variety of industry players cost effectively adopting the limo platform for non differentiating handset middleware more development resources are being devoted to enhancing the consumer experience this new wave of limo handsets serves as proof
1237433 the opening of our beijing office and the appointment of shan further underlines our deep commitment to china and the chinese market we welcome shan to the firm and we look forward to working together
1237434 we see tremendous opportunities both in china and to partner with chinese companies outside of china the opening of our beijing office and the appointment of shan gives us another great resource to take advantage of those opportunities
1237435 i am very excited about joining blackstone as its chief representative in beijing i look forward to working with the blackstone china team to channel the global reach and resources of blackstones alternative asset and advisory platform and increase its presence in the china markets
1237436 3pl central really understands my needs as a 3pl and has developed the exact 3pl wms functionality necessary to support my food related inventory management system needs
1237437 and with the billing wizard they help make sure we dont miss any billable events
1237438 were excited about the new variable unit of measure capabilities for our existing and future customers
1237439 the way weve implemented the feature goes well beyond just catch weight and supports our 3pl customers diverse vendor needs so they can grow their businesses
1237440 increased end user awareness and ongoing advances in technology are helping shape better products and services
1237441 bluecat networks enterprise class proteus ipam solution represents a significant advance in secure reliable and scalable network appliances by making it simple for administrators to integrate ip inventory tracking and allocation with dns and dhcp management
1237442 utilizing bluecat networks ipam solution administrators can design networks with a simple conceptual view then deploy and manage them across the organization and when managing dns and dhcp proteus acts as
1237443 as these awards go to the best technology products every year bluecat networks is honored that proteus has won the network products guide reader trust award
1237444 bluecat networks customers recognize that the uptime of a network is critical to business and this award from the knowledgeable readership reaffirms that bluecat networks is meeting this need by providing the best products and services available
1237445 after all if devices cannot obtain a valid ip address and if networks are not readily accessible it will not only result in poor network performance and productivity but also more significantly with a negative impact on profitability and customer relationships no ip means no network which means no business
1237446 the acquisition of acclamation systems is another step towards solidifying ebixs position as a leading global powerhouse of insurance automation and expertise it will also mark ebixs entry into the fast growing health benefits and claims processing sector of the insurance industry
1237447 ebix is already a leading player in the life insurance exchange markets because the life and health markets go hand in hand with a large number of health carriers selling life insurance products and vice versa we believe that this acquisition will open cross selling opportunities for us on many fronts also we intend to deploy benefits and claims services across international markets using our existing presence in 50 plus countries
1237448 we are pleased that the acquisition provides us with a cohesive management team under the leadership of jim senge and an employee base that has delivered consistently and brings specialized health and claims expertise to ebix
1237449 on the economic front we are excited about this acquisition on many accounts firstly it brings a revenue base to the company that is 60 recurring secondly it is a business that is likely to be accretive to ebix earnings per share eps in the near and long term future
1237450 ebix is an acknowledged leader in the insurance automation space and will provide acclamation with access to the resources and relationships in the health benefits sector that are needed to take the next great leap forward
1237451 they provide a natural home for acclamation and were excited that our current and future clients will benefit from all that ebix brings to the table
1237452 when you dont understand what the issues are and who the personalities are the best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut
1237453 he liked the area the hospital the staff and is quite comfortable in coming back here and working in the area
1237454 western health will have a second ob gyn for our hospital in the next few months and dr parsons will be well advised to keep his comments to himself and stay out of the business of passing comments that concern the people of bay st george
1237455 the encryption with skype telephone software creates grave difficulties for us
1237456 we cant decipher it thats why were talking about source telecommunication surveillance that is getting to the source before encryption or after its been decrypted
1237457 there are no discussions with skype i dont think that would help
1237458 i dont think that any provider would go for that
1237459 the combination of limos transparent governance model balanced development model and extensive mobile industry heritage sets it apart
1237460 we want to make this the most widely used operating system on the planet
1237461 you need to let the accc set the pricing its not for us or telstra to set the price
1237462 this scenario guarantees nobody will build this network or if they did build it nobody could afford to reinvest in upgrading or maintaining it
1237463 you want a utility return but you need good return to reinvest in the network
1237464 this broadband network is far more important than people realise youre not going to have any service based businesses being competitive unless you have fast broadband
1237465 thats why pricing is important because broadband at high uptake and ease of use is essential
1237466 the tour is bigger than anything the band have done before
1237467 they will be on the road for more than a year possibly pushing 18 months
1237468 the dates could easily run into three figures and will take them around the world
1237469 it is on the kind of scale you would expect from the roliing stones the fellas who have hatched the plan are very proud and excited
1237470 the first few weeks i felt for him because hes got to drum like four people
1237471 hes gotta play like our old drummers tony mccarroll alan white and zak starkey and of course himself
1237472 to play drums in oasis is deceptively difficult you cant play like the whos keith moon particularly on the older stuff because it wasnt about drums
1237473 on lyla and tracks like that you can pretend to be moon
1237474 but the older stuff youve got to pretend youre tony mccarroll
1237475 anything thats a card or that size we send in an express envelope that way it doesnt get opened or lost
1237476 i think there were four that were lost one to calgary two to edmonton and one to bragg creek alta to me the common denominator is corner brook
1237477 using express post is what weve had to do to make sure grandchildren get their birthday card or whatever
1237478 the kicker for me was when i put one in a brown manila envelope and it still didnt get there
1237479 thats when i started sending it express post and its been getting there ever since
1237480 we do encourage our customers to report immediately any issue or if they have any doubts to our customer service if we dont know about it theres nothing we can do
1237481 this is unfortunate because over 96 per cent of the time we do deliver all the mail that is put into our network which is one of the best performances in the country in atlantic canada were one of the best
1237482 its very good the weathers co operating and weve got 10 very enthusiastic people here who come from varying backgrounds
1237483 the project is worthy of the people here and the city
1237484 i think its going to be very picturesque and relate to the location a boat to signify cooks expedition here commemorate him and make it a fairly interesting place for tourists to come
1237485 i think the biggest mistake people make is people try to build a wall thats too thin or just skimping on the amount of stone
1237486 stone will stay up for you as long as its got other stones to lean against and youve got enough mass there
1237487 its the same thing with a retaining wall people lean stones against a hill and think its retaining but its not
1237488 the stones are being held up by the hill and not vice versa people are not thinking about what they need to do which is building a wall like a dam dams have mass they have enough material to hold back a great amount of water if youre building a retaining wall you need mass
1237489 ive never worked with stone like this but i like to work with stone in my artwork
1237490 ive got a big interest in working with nature in nature artistically and this is a good opportunity to understand the craft
1237491 it works well for us because were getting this built here
1237492 were paying for the materials and the instruction is a separate issue between john and kenny
1237493 wrote researchers eric horvitz of microsoft and jure leskovec of in a paper that was presented earlier this year at the www 2008 conference in beijing
1237494 we might say that via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people
1237495 according to moses when he said whats your name dude god said i am who i am or i will be who i will be
1237496 but thats kind of wordy so im just going for i am who i am as my full legal name
1237497 it has been a while since i let yall know whats
1237498 she might not know who i am but i know who she is shes the woman i made a promise to until death do us part
1237499 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1237500 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1237501 lost touch with his own family let alone the people of the district
1237502 i think just about anybody would have to have more integrity than my brother
1237503 hey jose im tired of this calender crap we been at it for 500 years lets just quit
1237504 you know what miguel youre right i just saw the chiefs daughter in her new outfit for the alter sacrifice lets go chase her around
1237505 hey miguel you put one more date on this calender wheel and im gonna break your knee caps because youre doing this instead of tryin to get the pesos you owe me
1237506 oh yeah i also hold the patent on google earth
1237507 this will probably be the nicest apartment you live in for the next ten years
1237508 for one hour you could pretend that you too were russian
1237509 now were paying for what we did to our brother we saw how terrified he was when he was begging us for mercy we wouldnt listen to him and now were the ones in trouble
1237510 i kid both my senpai and i had a blast singing it xd well at least i did and no we did not end up like
1237511 going through my head in many parts of the game i did realize how it mustve been difficult to balance a script between realistic and cheesy and i did like how the lines were mostly tongue in cheek anyways xd so was the whole of
1237512 be careful what you do to jacob whether good or bad
1237513 help marketers buy across search display local mobile and video inventory all from a single integrated interface
1237514 it might be naive of me but perversely i think i might have more chance in europe than i do in my own country
1237515 ive lost two jobs because of this my bosses just didnt want to be associated with the publicity
1237516 right now id be quite glad of a two year delay
1237517 its better than being handed over to us marshals and being put on a plane straight away
1237518 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1237519 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1237520 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1237521 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1237522 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1237523 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1237524 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1237525 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1237526 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet

1237531 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1237532 you know that pile of papers in your office we look through that for things that seem important or things that seem interesting and we try to fix them
1237533 so what do you do if you cant figure out the solution
1237534 i think ill phone and see what they are doing
1237535 i think ill phone real estate investing and see what they are doing
1237536 i think ill phone dog training and see what they are doing
1237537 we particularly regret to report the loss in the affected accounts of approximately 10 of the messages received between july 16 and july 18
1237538 how can we share these with everyone on the network
1237539 what happened in the brewers game prince fielder just went after manny parra in the dugout i though youd know what happened
1237540 theyll show it the next prince comes to the plate
1237541 well it would be nice to see a highlight of that incident
1237542 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1237543 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1237544 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
1237545 there is a whole confluence of government policies tax spending regulatory and administrative that have subsidized sprawl
1237546 i told you so you should have waited till the bugs were ironed out
1237547 unless someone can look into an iphone and read the exif data directly off the image that is stored on the phone then we dont know if the issue is image capture iphoto changing the tags or if the phone writes them incorrectly personally i rekon it is the way the camera application uses the location services
1237548 what were trying to get the court to say is that for the duration of a contract the telephone company should not be able to unilaterally modify the conditions of the contract
1237549 as a show of respect for the all those who have suffered at the hands religious zealots around the world and throughout history
1237550 my strengths are that im a pretty good pass blocker
1237551 i can run block too but i like to pass block better im pretty big so i can drive people off the line
1237552 he had an awesome year for us even though he missed four games
1237553 im a man that made a mistake i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself and not do it in a spiteful way but do it with the labor and the sound mind that god gives me
1237554 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i havent really forgiven myself
1237555 i have a big responsibility to a lot of people and i know i disappointed a lot of people
1237556 but i will not allow this moment in the book of life to define me
1237557 this is the moment i decided to put myself in by my actions im going to take it like a man and take this opportunity to let god break me humble me and continuously let me move forward and be the person i can truly be im a god fearing man no matter what people may think or say its an opportunity for me to stand tall and take my punishment im going to take it with god at my side and not me standing up trying to stand up being something that im not
1237558 i think the one thing that weve learned is how you travel
1237559 unfortunately we arent at the point now where we can fly to tallahassee so the trip to tallahassee will be tough because it takes us out of our routine
1237560 in the meac you have to learn to play for four quarters
1237561 no disrespect in the ciaa but you could get up big on some teams and kind of coast you cant do that in this league
1237562 the wear and tear of practicing on the new field would kill the grass
1237563 i think matt had some other issues off the field
1237564 coming into camp last year he had just lost his best friend in a drowning and i dont think he ever got over it it might have been too soon for him to ease into a program
1237565 its been a while since weve been this young blount said
1237566 motorola is the pioneer in mobile devices and im honored to become co ceo of this company and ceo of the mobile devices business
1237567 i welcome the opportunity to lead this company into the future while working to create a successful independent mobile devices company that will continue to innovate and grow for years to come
1237568 its right on the beach so we got pictures on the beach
1237569 but the ceremony was in the hotel so that the grandmothers wouldnt complain about sand
1237570 they bust on me but i bust on them right back its that love love relationship its fine
1237571 i kind of have my life going the way i want it to be
1237572 on the field i dont think a lot would bother me much so im just really concentrated on making that kick and doing well on the field to promote myself and my family so maybe we can try that next step
1237573 but if not thats not a big deal ill find some classifieds somewhere and get the highlighter
1237574 i met her going into the summer of my high school senior year
1237575 actually her mom was my science teacher in the ninth grade
1237576 im trying to do the best in both worlds there
1237577 i think this is the offseason i worked the hardest in last season i came off surgery this time last year was the first time i was able to do either kicking or punting and the year before that i just kind of nonchalanted it
1237578 but this season i think im really ready for it and just more excited than anything
1237579 they remember the ones you miss and its always what have you done for me lately
1237580 its fine with me i just keep on trucking and do what i know how to do and if they remember me fine if they dont its not that big a deal
1237581 the deal is some weeks it might be the tires and some weeks it might be the weather or fuel mileage everyone is in the same boat
1237582 last week the tire problems at indianapolis was something nobody wanted to have to deal with but we did this week it was a whole new different type of stresses but thats just racing
1237583 we talked about what we would do if the rain were to clear up and they got the track dried and thats what we ended up doing
1237584 and then it started raining harder and carl is on the pit box with me and were arguing at that point about why we did what we did
1237585 the argument came when it started raining real hard and we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming in to pit
1237586 i wasnt aware about the shouting match but the crew chief is empowered in our world to make the final decision the driver knows more about whats going on right in front of him as it relates to who has gone down pit road and who didnt go but bob made a courageous call
1237587 the hard part was to run fast enough to stay in front of jimmie and slow enough to save fuel
1237588 you just have to lift early 100 or 200 yards earlier in each corner than youre used to
1237589 we have a proud history in racing with 54 continuous years of nascar involvement and have enjoyed worldwide success in all forms of racing but all should be assured that no one was more disappointed than we were with the events in indianapolis
1237590 we are the first to admit that we missed the mark with the combination for this race there are many reasons but they are only important today from the perspective that we learn from those issues and move forward successfully
1237591 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1237592 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1237593 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1237594 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1237595 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1237596 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1237597 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1237598 today is the day when my dream is coming true
1237599 at last i get to finalize the last chapter of my case
1237600 it really feels strange to think that i will see my father for the first time in my life
1237601 i cannot imagine what my father looks like now i will probably be speechless when i see him
1237602 even as we keep working globally we need to do much more to fight aids at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1237603 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1237604 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1237605 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
1237606 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
1237607 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
1237608 hes got some stiffness and well just see what it is i didnt think it was anything serious just because the velocity was still there
1237609 its in the deltoid below my shoulder strength is fine velocity is fine
1237610 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1237611 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1237612 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1237613 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1237614 a major concern that i have is the quarterback position because we have to solidify a guy there
1237615 and we think we have enough talent to solidify that spot we dont have a monte purvis right now but we have the talent to make it work
1237616 we are going to be a fairly young football team up front on defense
1237617 quintin jones and kevin dorsey return but we lost william hayes who was a big part of the defense we lost keith newton and those guys made a big impact for us
1237618 with hayes he made plays that the average guy just doesnt make and that is why hes at the next level
1237619 we are going to miss him and he was actually the one guy that offenses had to run away from
1237620 if williams is the best one of what we have then hell play
1237621 the guy that gives us the best chance to win is the guy we are going to play with and i dont care what year he is in our program
1237622 the thing ive always said since ive been here is the key to success of the program is if you can keep the quarterback in your program for four years
1237623 you dont realize how good monte was until you see him on film
1237624 monte made so many plays and i look back on film now and i think did i miss that play
1237625 the bottom line is we can sit here and talk about who we think can be the guy but you never know until camp starts and you see the chemistry with how it works with each one of them
1237626 for me personally when a kid walks into a huddle i can almost tell who those 10 guys like as their quarterback i can tell how the quarterback is going to approach the huddle and those are the telltale signs that you look for
1237627 its fun to see and develop a kid at that position and see him improve each day one thing we try and teach is dont make the same mistake twice
1237628 it doesnt matter if youre joe the milkman or whoever
1237629 regardless of whether you go to the super bowl or not youve got to learn from your mistakes youll get punished for them
1237630 everyday i go out and plan to start the race im getting more and more confident because every day you run more on it and it gets stronger
1237631 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1237632 this is something i think that has brought this team closer together
1237633 as far as holding the team back i dont feel like it will do so i think its only going to make us better and bring us closer as a team and work toward the ultimate goal of winning the trophy this year
1237634 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong it was an asinine decision
1237635 for me to be a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1237636 trials and tribulations only make you stronger as a man for me and steve im sure he regrets his actions he took but i would be less of a man if i dont forgive him i go to bible study just like he does every week for me to not be able to forgive him im just wasting my time going to bible study
1237637 theres a lot of things that have been brewing for four years now
1237638 i cant possibly tell you what the issues are in this one conversation what has happened in four years the good thing is we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without having any other type of altercations like weve had in the past were bigger than that sometimes when emotions get involved you do stupid things thats what humans do
1237639 were still waiting for the doctors to give us the timetable on when to get the procedure done
1237640 there are a lot of guys in this league that could not have done the things that luc has done for him to show up at fan fest was huge for us i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal were all behind luc 100 percent and were behind steve too hes still one of us
1237641 when i came over to the stadium i wasnt coming to get a warm welcome
1237642 i was really just coming over to be part of the team and not separate myself from the team but lo and behold it was very overwhelming how they responded to me you can view things as a gift or a curse and i look at this as a gift we have a team that i think has what it takes to win a super bowl this year
1237643 i think hes got a chance to be a high school all america
1237644 hes not as big obviously as hickson and hes not a post player
1237645 hes more of a power forward who has really good shooting range and can play on the wing i think he can have at least equal if not more immediate impart for the wolfpack as hickson did
1237646 i was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on
1237647 it was a lot of fun it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe
1237648 it made it hard to see at the end it was raining so hard and everything was getting so wet the guys said there was an inch of water in the right side of the car laying on the floorboard so we were going to start having electrical problems
1237649 they couldnt keep the race going it was too wet
1237650 i commend nascar for making the call to stop that race because it was getting dangerous out there
1237651 i learned i dont want to race in the rain in nascar again its really tricky
1237652 maybe if there is inclement weather again down the road nascar wont be so frightened to put us out there on wets because we got a race in everyone was safe and it was a decent show i guess the tires held up and the cars held up
1237653 i think all the drivers kept on the track for the most part and we got a race in which is important i think to nascars credit for not running rain races very often they did a pretty good job
1237654 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
1237655 as long as you could see where you were going
1237656 the driving is ok as long as you can get the water off your windshield if you have a wiper youre all right
1237657 when it started raining hard again i had some oil on the window and just couldnt get rid of it the only thing i could use to drive was the edge of the track i couldnt see a thing when everybody stopped i just ran into the back of them
1237658 pit stops in the rain thats something no ones ever even done in their life around here its something i know ive never even thought about
1237659 i just dont understand why we go past halfway in the rain i think if youre halfway youve got to stop it and we went until there were 26 laps to go its pouring rain and were racing
1237660 i hit a lapped car with no brake lights i have no idea who it was i couldnt see five feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution somebody stopped i locked up all four and boom
1237661 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
1237662 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those
1237663 i have to be honest i had a lot of fun this is pretty cool the first points race in the rain but when drivers are saying enough is enough we need to heed that caution and we did not
1237664 my dad made me realize what things are really worth
1237665 just coming to america there are so many things it makes me really appreciate
1237666 i used that to kind of motivate myself and see how hard people work and how proud people are to represent their country
1237667 from that point on i was like man i want to go to the olympics
1237668 the best thing that could happen for me is winning the gold for the united states
1237669 being an american is not something im going to take lightly when i took that oath i meant every piece of it
1237670 this is very special running tonight now im part of the usa going to beijing im very excited
1237671 i have different roots leo has different roots bernard has different roots but now our roots are in america and this is where we all come together and say hey lets all go out there and represent our country
1237672 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1237673 he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1237674 an effective command system has been established and we have strengthened cooperation in security work including information exchange and the combat against terrorism with other countries especially those which hosted the games before
1237675 to ensure the security and safety of everyone at the games
1237676 it is also our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the chinese people to share the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future
1237677 in the last three decades of reform and opening up china has made not only rapid economic development and social progress but also great achievements in sport
1237678 our romanian drilling campaign this year of four wells back to back has got off to the perfect start with the first two establishing commercial gas and expected to be on production during the fourth quarter of this year
1237679 la red de transporte de toda la regi n debe construir un denso ambiente de transporte y producci n seguros

1237684 con tratamiento ortop dico y de rehabilitaci n se estima que el tiempo de baja ser aproximadamente de 3 meses
1237685 no me ven mi sonrisa habla por s sola hay buenas noticias
1237686 nous sommes plein de larmes que personne ne vienne nous secouer
1237687 je navais pas les dipl mes n cessaires pour entreprendre un assaut sans ordonnance javais peur de vous faire mal peur de vous d brancher peur davoir peur il y a encore des choses quon ne fait pas lh pital
1237688 im considered to be a short guy but hey it doesnt matter leverage is leverage
1237689 go out and get your pads under the other guy get position and get the job done this is a low mans game height really doesnt matter
1237690 olin really reminds me of my dad a tough nosed guy a disciplinarian who leads by example
1237691 hes been a great coach and im just humbled to be learning from him everything he says to me i just soak it up
1237692 i think youve got to be serious about your job
1237693 i dont think i have a right or a privilege yet to be joking around or goofing off i have one year in the league a blip compared to some of these guys who have seven or 11
1237694 they are a hard working group on the offensive line quick studies and perfectionists i have to bring more positives than negatives they have so many years under their belt i just have to be as good as they want me to be
1237695 this is obviously a competition so you want to play your best and put your best foot forward in these two preseason games three however many
1237696 judging by the zip and accuracy of his passes so far nobody reported to camp more serious about improving than rex grossman some of his throws make ones thrown by truck drivers
1237697 no reason to support tell it to one who uses windows and it will be treason
1237698 i got caught in an awkward tackle from a kick off and they the medical staff tell me i must have got a shot in the right spot at the right time and with the right force because its chipped away a bit of the bone
1237699 personally i think the start of the competition is great without all the all blacks i think its a lot fairer and theres not so much of a division between the super 14 sides and the other ones
1237700 with the super 14 its at the start of the year and by the time you get towards the end of the npc you know youve got four to six weeks off coming up
1237701 were still up for this but it is hard to keep performing at that level for that long thats something weve touched on and the coaches rob penney and john haggart have been really helpful in terms of training and training loads and trying to add more variety and keep the fun levels up
1237702 thats the big thing if you keep doing the same old same old from december through to october it starts to get very very tedious but i have to say there is a fair bit of resolve in this team to at least go one better than last year and make the final
1237703 auckland will be there or thereabouts even though theyve lost a few players but id say wellington would be the favourites at this stage
1237704 im contracted until the end of next year but there are out clauses in that contract
1237705 i reckon john oneill deserves the credit for all of this
1237706 it just builds pressure and can affect the decision making of the opposition and i think there was possibly elements in terms they became a little bit individual and coughed up ball as a result
1237707 we were able to target the ball carrier but i suspect we have probably created a rod for our backs for next week
1237708 he hasnt even got a first down let him pick up a third and 1
1237709 hes probably been getting more reps than anybody at the 1s adrian peterson would get the first couple then matt would get the second half
1237710 matts done an excellent job hes a good football player hes smart he can make people miss he loves the game and thats not to put anybody down we know what a p brings matt has some special qualities about him and were hoping he can put them on the field for real
1237711 going into the game obviously im going to get some reps with the 1s
1237712 im the rookie coming in so of course they want to see what i can do in a game situation
1237713 i know its a preseason game and were going to keep it pretty basic but i dont want to make any mental errors
1237714 i dont want to fumble the ball or miss a block
1237715 ive heard about that since high school and i really dont pay attention to it
1237716 i really dont call it an upright running style because when i see a defender coming im not going to stand straight up i dont really care when they say that
1237717 theres a lot of guys who have made it throughout the league who have had what some would term an upright running style
1237718 and there are times when you can tell hes running a little high but you know what one good hit will take care of all that
1237719 let me meet him tomorrow and let us see how the discussion goes
1237720 we dont want to see the coalition breaking up the promises should be fulfilled so that democracy is strengthened and the dictator is punished
1237721 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behaviour and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1237722 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1237723 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
1237724 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1237725 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1237726 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
1237727 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
1237728 for example parents could sit with their child on an ordinary train first then sit with them somewhere dark then perhaps have games where people jump out and say boo gradual ways to decrease fear
1237729 it makes me a little nervous and the wind out here is really strong
1237730 but i just have to keep getting repetition at it
1237731 you know you dropped one but there are five more that will come at you so you have to catch those
1237732 hes making progress hes working on it every day hopefully he will be all right for next week
1237733 we thought he was struggling with the speed of the game the pace of the game was probably the quickest you will ever see guys who have not played at that level for a while find that tough
1237734 we have henry the enemy is sic deans hes a south islander for gods sake anyway
1237735 i guess it was difficult but i think well still remain really good friends
1237736 everyones made such a huge sacrifice theyve put in just as much effort i really do feel for all of them that missed out
1237737 we had new zealand under 18 trials the end of 2006 the under 21s were training next to us and there was an injury
1237738 they said they were going to pick one of us to go to the youth olympics in sydney a couple of days later they picked me
1237739 shes a pretty exciting player and had to be to bump lotte harrison out of her position
1237740 it was pretty tough if it was a world cup where teams carry 18 not 16 players they would have made it together
1237741 we found her a lot more prominent she was linking far more frequently than lotte
1237742 gemma hasnt had the exposure lottes got but she gave us a little bit of a new dimension and in the screens and presses we use she gives us a lot of energy and power
1237743 i tried really hard but i was a bit overwhelmed by the other girls in the team and i didnt think i had a huge shot
1237744 when we went to the olympic venue i took it in but i had a real quiet approach as i thought maybe i wouldnt be lucky enough to play here
1237745 im so lucky to be in this position at such a young age but theres still so much to learn
1237746 id just played nhl for two years and theyre all names i would look up to and now im playing alongside them
1237747 theyre always helping me along the way telling me which positions i have to be in
1237748 we hope to surprise the world with an excellent performance
1237749 in a lot better frame of mind than three weeks ago
1237750 polands a good motivational tool were learning from the positive stuff there but dont want to experience it again
1237751 its a matter of remembering what weve done what were capable of
1237752 initially it was one step forward two steps back but things have got progressively better
1237753 were not doing anything different than at any other time were always trying to improve technically to get faster in the boat
1237754 were lucky to have new zealand crews to gauge ourselves against
1237755 we have good days and bad days but the good days mean something when youre competing with the rest of the crews
1237756 on some days recentiy i wish we could race in beijing tomorrow
1237757 the chinese government has put in place a system to spy on and gather information about every guest at hotels where olympic visitors are staying
1237758 several international hotel chains have confirmed the existence of this order
1237759 in order to ensure the smooth opening of olympic in beijing and the expo in shanghai in 2010 safeguard the security of internet network and the information thereon in the hotels it is required that your company install and run the security management system
1237760 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1237761 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1237762 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 percent of chd
1237763 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30
1237764 why not nip things in the bud such early signs of heart disease should be taken as seriously as early signs of cancer or diabetes
1237765 our sympathy goes to them we always told people to buy tickets from the official supplier
1237766 it was an operation to retrieve stolen goods and the police came under fire
1237767 teaching is a noble profession we are analysing feedback received from teachers and their organisations in this regard what i can tell at this time is that we could propose certain measures to ensure that their problems are sorted out and more people take an interest in joining the profession
1237768 we will take a minimum of another three months to compile and study the data then the report would be submitted
1237769 developing cold feet before joining the sector owing to the poor package
1237770 there are only six people on this committee it is obvious that we will take time to complete our study but our recommendations will be helpful to the teaching fraternity
1237771 the committee hopes that the states will be convinced to think more positively in their own interest for sparing adequate resources for higher education
1237772 pay revision is but an inescapable and most crucial step towards attracting and retaining the talented people to the teaching profession none of the states can afford to lag behind anymore
1237773 technically nifty futures have now reached a zone infested with resistance in the 4440 4500 region above which it is likely to move up to 4550 and 4600 it must move above the 4500 region decisively on closing basis to signal fresh momentum though its immediate support is around the 4400 region the strong support which is expected to hold on dips is at 4340 region below which it may again slide to 4300 4250 region a decisive breach of 4160 will signal bearishness at this juncture markets are likely to open on a weak note on bearish global cues and then chart their own course as the day progresses volatility may remain high as markets seek fresh trend so make the best of it
1237774 we are preparing to bring prius into the indian market though we have not set any timeline yet
1237775 in the run up we have to develop skills to service it and make spare parts available across the country
1237776 in the long run it is economical with higher mileage and lower maintenance cost we are confident of its acceptability in the indian market as it runs both on electricity and fuel
1237777 we are aware that honda is launching its hybrid variant in the indian market soon despite high import tariff we can also do it with due preparation as i said earlier we have to gear up to service such a premium car by training our personnel and stocking enough spare parts with the dealer network
1237778 though we entered the indian market over a decade ago we chose to be in niche and premium segments as a marketing strategy we first introduced qualis which was a run away success in the multi utility segment
1237779 we launched innova by discontinuing qualis and yet maintained market leadership in the segment in the second hand or used car market toyota brands commands highest price even today because of their value and durability
1237780 with the indian economy poised to grow over eight nine percent we see immense potential to grow thanks to increasing purchasing power higher aspirations among the generation next better road connectivity and migrant driven urbanization
1237781 im not at my best at the moment and im not afraid to say it
1237782 no not at all it would be a wonderful dream to win another medal for my country i havent lost the confidence that i can repeat what i did before
1237783 hes the defending champion if he doesnt get one any more i dont know who will get one
1237784 ive been through this many times before though on a smaller scale
1237785 but im fine just getting on with my training and the problem will be solved by winning one two or three important games
1237786 if i win a tournament ill be back up to 80th and everything will be forgotten
1237787 im under a lot of pressure but there are players who perhaps are under more pressure than me for example roger federer who is nearly 27 and for whom this will be the last olympic games where he is at his peak
1237788 there are other players who will be at their last olympics and need this title to make their careers more important
1237789 its not a problem fernando and i have known each other since we were 10
1237790 when we played at athens we didnt arrive with too many games under our belts
1237791 if you sign a five year contract and youre in year one you see the deal through you honour it
1237792 you just dont walk away in the first year or if youre not happy you ask for a release you can always get one if both sides agree sometimes people have genuinely got a reason to leave ive never seen a problem that cant be ironed out by sitting around a table
1237793 if they dont do anything they will open the doors for others to do it it sets a precedent
1237794 but hes walked out on his clubmates so how would his kiwis team mates feel you want guys beside you in your national team jersey who you would want to go in the trenches with
1237795 but hes shown disrespect to everyone id say hes got some real poor advice from somewhere
1237796 proceedings will seek to restrain sonny bill williams from playing anywhere in the world other than in accordance with the contract with the bulldogs
1237797 the consequences of breaching an injunction when put in place are that he is liable to contempt of court proceedings that can involve everything from arrest to seizure of assets
1237798 the club is entitled to take on whatever player they see fit
1237799 our jurisdiction is a player must make sure he is fit to play international rugby
1237800 what if we could go through red lights and steal cars
1237801 i dont know how long youve been part of youtube but there used to be a time during the golden age
1237802 where the community was on fire and users knew each other by name and shared feelings and opinions it was great
1237803 there was just a core group of people who were doing vlogs
1237804 we want to make sure that the natural beauty which brought people to the cape in the first place would continue to exist

1237806 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mer rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation

1237808 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away
1237809 that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour 2 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts 3 but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men 7 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day 8 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing than any should perish but that all should come to repentance 9 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up

1237816 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1237817 what their bid is about is 2 8 billion more over three years the whole education budget is 2 billion so it is totally unaffordable it is sort of magic pudding meets wizard of oz

1237824 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club

1237830 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1237831 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

1237899 the last few weeks have been mentally draining with my rehab for my ankle and then with the pressures of the semi finals and trying to make the final
1237900 i havent thought too far ahead of the next game and thats the grand final
1237901 the grand final is a totally different ball game and its a clean slate for both teams
1237902 we were expecting each end to be a little bit different but i think theyve come together well
1237903 the consistency in the umpiring has been a bonus in the semi finals
1237904 theyve got a dynamic shooting circle with catherine cox and susan pratley so its our job to stop them
1237905 weve been concentrating on doing our job and doing what we do best
1237906 weve got on top before but we just havent been able to put that throttle down
1237907 ive had three games now to build confidence and get out there and see what i can do
1237908 it was well received by our submissions staff but ive decided not to purchase it because im a humbug like that
1237909 he was able to manipulate this passage and the young believe consented to having sex with him
1237910 sometimes because i am very shy when i meet a director and they are shy too we just sort of sit there i remember when i met ang lee and we were left alone i was so shy and he was so shy neither of us said anything to each other for about 20 minutes
1237911 very shy really shy i even had a stutter as a kid which i slowly got over but i still regress into that shyness so i dont like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself i dont like going to a party by myself
1237912 the fear of being in public places which led to anxiety or panic attacks
1237913 most of us are shy to some degree but acute shyness is one of the most under recognised mental health problems of the modern age say some
1237914 was first recognised as a mental health condition in 1980 and some professionals believe its one of the most under recognised and under treated mental health problems of the modern age
1237915 brad thorns been playing rugby for a while now and hes been cited once in his career and hes had two yellow cards in recent times
1237916 but i dont think that necessitates him having a discipline problem
1237917 he plays a physical game and tonight he just got a guy step back inside him probably one of the best guys at stepping in giteau and he reacted to that and got him across the shoulders
1237918 i dont think we can panic and say we have got a discipline problem
1237919 i understand it was blood there was a fair amount of discussion around it
1237920 its been a little bit nostalgic particularly the first time back on the lake
1237921 our first session was in singles and theres a couple of bridges you have to row under to get into and out of the course and the last time i was under one of them i was going out for the final and the other one i had a gold medal around my neck
1237922 it was quite a strange feeling but its just great being back here its a superb training venue and the weathers been kind to us
1237923 ive been given this chance to do it again and its a privilege its so much fun to be racing again going to another games winning theyre all the things i loved about the sport and i missed a lot
1237924 the ultimate test is what youre doing on the water and i was very pleased with my singles speed during the summer ive got a lot of confidence from that and i couldnt have had a better olympics preparation than i had in the summer
1237925 it was first class got me so well prepared with that intensity and that volume its what you need in olympic year that sort of commitment i feel physically in as good a shape as i ever have been
1237926 we scull the same and we have the same strengths and weaknesses mentally we approach things the same
1237927 its been good getting to know the guy youre rowing with and i just get more and more confidence in him all the time and hopefully the same goes for him
1237928 in the single you tend to get one or two at the top of the food chain and the bigger the boat the more you get crews in a line
1237929 in our race we feel theres eight crews going for six spots in the final those eight crews all have pretty good speed in the single i felt i could have a bad day and still make the final

1237935 it was extremely frustrating we were creating a lot of line breaks and opportunities but through handling errors we were not able to convert
1237936 you cant win test matches through so many dropped balls and things like that
1237937 you cant put it down to the weather or anything like that its just basic skills or lack of thats not really acceptable at this level
1237938 it would have changed the game in terms of where you can and cannot attack from
1237939 a lot of us know robbie quite well and know what he wants to do
1237940 we wanted to cover that i thought the back three were outstanding and really made them come up and give a pretty good chase line and they did that
1237941 it was one of those ones where could pick and choose maybe a bit more when to run it and when we dont run it
1237942 i regret that it now appears bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time
1237943 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
1237944 we are going to do our best to facilitate the foreign media to do their reporting work through the internet
1237945 i would remind you that falun gong is an evil fake religion which has been banned by the chinese government
1237946 we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more sceptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
1237947 in this short a time frame even if you took all the personal cars off the highway you might see another 10 per cent improvement but it would be small
1237948 the best thing that could happen during the games is to have it rain every night
1237949 yes not many people here doesnt look crowded we picked a great day to come

1237957 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1237958 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1237959 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1237960 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

1237964 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1237965 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1237966 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1237967 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1237968 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1237969 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1237970 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1237971 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1237972 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1237973 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1237974 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1237975 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1237976 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1237977 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1237978 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1237979 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1237980 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1237981 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1237982 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1237983 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1237984 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1237985 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1237986 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1237987 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1237988 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1237989 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1237990 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1237991 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1237992 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1237993 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1237994 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1237995 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1237996 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1237997 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1237998 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1237999 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1238000 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1238001 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1238002 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1238003 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1238004 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1238005 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1238006 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1238007 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1238008 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1238009 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1238010 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1238011 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1238012 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1238013 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1238014 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1238015 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1238016 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1238017 its rate of elimination of toxic waste products which decreases the demands placed on the kidneys
1238018 increases your breathing and your body temperature thus aiding in your internal cleansing
1238019 is a way of life based upon living in harmony with nature through a balanced whole foods diet an active lifestyle and respect for the natural environment
1238020 background tv is a disruptive and distracting influence our evidence is that tv keeps the children from sustaining their attention at a time when developmentally theyre beginning to organize their attention skills and sequencing behaviors
1238021 parents think it background tv doesnt matter because the programs arent directed at children but just because a child isnt paying active attention doesnt mean it doesnt have a disruptive effect
1238022 childrens play episodes were shorter about half as long if the tv was on compared to when it wasnt and children were more likely to move from toy to toy during the time tv was on
1238023 the kids look normal they dont look distressed or distracted
1238024 all of the concerns we have with children watching programming for children still apply to secondhand viewing it distracts from the work of childhood from play
1238025 so if i see your gate down next sunday afternoon im going to get a drill and stick a goddamn bolt in it and lock you down for the next week right

1238037 there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes
1238038 pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children take time to get medical checkups take your spouse out to dinner play another 18 there will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand
1238039 in a worst case scenario porrettas actions could have caused a train to crash
1238040 there are safety procedures to follow when removing redundant track from beside the railway line which porretta did not follow
1238041 a piece of rail track could have struck a passing train and caused a serious rail incident fortunately this did not happen
1238042 we hope that it sends out a strong message that this type of crime will not be tolerated
1238043 the fact that this man has received a substantial prison sentence should serve as a warning to any thieves who steal from the railway infrastructure
1238044 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1238045 further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry

1238049 i think barack obama will make a good choice for his vice presidential candidate and its not going to be me
1238050 we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas but
1238051 we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres of federal land they currently have access to but havent touched
1238052 is the first step in a long expensive process that may lead to exploration activity
1238053 it might take four to six years to begin production
1238054 if i can be in the last place he was of course id be there
1238055 i love you and i will miss you you will stay in our prayers and thank you for all your smiles
1238056 you see the pictures in the news and you think she was in there at one point this was the final place they were having a good time
1238057 i know any age is a terrible age to leave this world but 18 its a terrible tragedy
1238058 very confident that eventually hopefully soon we should be able to return
1238059 eventually all the stake holders will be familiar with the provisions
1238060 they will understand that it is for the good of all for the peace stability and development of the region
1238061 no sovereignty is given here this is for the benefit of mindanao and the country
1238062 i have full faith and trust in the court and they will find a way to decide in the shortest possible time
1238063 there ought not to be violence in any instance or in any area
1238064 the milf fired about a dozen mortars toward army positions
1238065 we returned mortar fire but there were no reports of casualties
1238066 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1238067 gorilla meat chimpanzee meat and meat of other apes fetches a higher price than beef chicken or fish
1238068 if you took all the individuals of the top 25 most endangered species and assigned each of them a seat they probably wouldnt fill a football stadium
1238069 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat

1238099 this matter is in the hands of the lawyers so it is inappropriate to make any comment at this stage what we can say though is that for some time ryanair has enjoyed substantial discounts in charges for using stansted airport
1238100 since april 1 2007 this arrangement no longer applies but our charges remain within the limit we are allowed to charge by our regulator the civil aviation authority caa

1238110 weve received a tremendous amount of positive feedback on ienvision
1238111 but we also received requests for simple ways to try the product out often in just one category we think the envi apps will be a great way for people to get to know the ienvision family

1238114 you could think of ron wayne kind of like the fifth beatle
1238115 he had a strong association with steve jobs and steve wozniak in the beginning but was not a participant in their future success
1238116 we are very happy to be able to share his story he represents a bit of history that very few people witnessed and most never knew
1238117 the addition of ron wayne to the film was simple

1238127 it is pleasing to see us scoring plenty of goals and the lads are enjoying their football
1238128 we started sloppily though and were second best for the first 20 minutes bradford worked very hard and we conceded a poor goal from our point of view
1238129 we got back into the game when christopher scored a good goal after a right wing cross from david amoo
1238130 we passed the ball better in the second half and we were much sharper
1238131 everyone has to realise that we arent the best in the world
1238132 we have got to work hard for what we get its going to be the same this year if we want to be successful again then weve got to work hard for it
1238133 ability wise spurs were better every time we got the ball we gave it away they didnt so if you are chasing it for 70 odd minutes its going to be difficult
1238134 its hard were not in the same league as spurs in regards to spending it is frustrating from our point of view

1238150 we looked at the hymns themselves to see if either the sound of the hymns or words from the chorus could help them name that hymn
1238151 the response was very positive they thought it was a great game and they told me i should consider expanding it by adding more hymns
1238152 our branch president is so smart he can name many of the hymns in one note

1238155 the case for democracy the power of freedom to overcome tyranny and terror
1238156 the players have surprised me in one aspect they are very professional
1238157 it was really good i was hoping to come on but did not really expect to
1238158 the manager told me to get on and i was really excited the conditions were difficult after my first sprint after i came on i was dripping wet with sweat
1238159 it was hard but great to play against a la liga team a great experience
1238160 i am very happy to be at the club it is a very good thing for me
1238161 the manager told me he was happy with me against doncaster and i was happy to sign for newcastle he said he wanted to put me in the team in the future but he also said if i am ready to play now i will play the best players will play
1238162 everybody has helped me settle in and feel good at newcastle i know it is a very very big club with a very big history some big players have played for this club and its like a dream for me here
1238163 i know i have to work hard to take this chance
1238164 im pleasantly surprised to see curtis back so quickly i couldnt have seen it when he picked up the injury he has confounded people by his quick return
1238165 hes done amazingly well but hes still well short of what i would call serious match practice
1238166 the young players were fantastic and young rafael the right back was a sensation for me
1238167 i thought it was a real eye opener for us he hadnt played for a year but hes played a full 90 minutes today his brother fabio has played 45 minutes and hes also done well so were really pleased by their contribution
1238168 playing at emirates stadium and giving all my heart to arsenal makes me feel very happy
1238169 ive been able to see in the last few weeks the passion that surrounds the club its a family
1238170 im delighted and hopeful this will be a good season ive been able to get to know my team mates during the preparation
1238171 besides i love the way arsenal play and the team spirit as well all the young players appreciate each other and you can feel it on the pitch
1238172 surely this was a one off milan with only one of seven attackers available but this does not justify the result which does alarm us
1238173 tomorrow morning i will meet with coach carlo ancelotti and i will have a report from the doctor or the fitness trainer to clarify the situation i was shocked by the result because milan is the most well known club throughout the world and a world champion we cannot have these results publicised around the world but i am convinced that we are strong partly because just a few days ago we won the trofeo tim against inter and juventus
1238174 im pretty good and the hamstrings coming good but with the travel factor it just didnt make sense to try to get up and play
1238175 the focus has always been round 1 against sydney and thats what im aiming for
1238176 it is tempting to play because it is a cup and we want to win it but this gives me a few extra days to get treatment and get maximum strength under my belt for the first game
1238177 the investigating agencies did not do their job so we inquired into the matter and gathered documentary evidence in the case
1238178 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
1238179 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1238180 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1238181 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
1238182 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
1238183 for example parents could sit with their child on an ordinary train first then sit with them somewhere dark then perhaps have games where people jump out and say boo gradual ways to decrease fear

1238188 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we
1238189 the question is who ought to make that decision the congress or the commanders and as you know my position is clear im a commander guy

1238222 the australian reinvigoration of the industry has not really been successful weve been trying to re mine old deposits
1238223 this industry is dependent on new discoveries and new mines coming on stream and at the moment its not happening
1238224 its very very tough in places like south africa and australia to bring costs down because youre fighting a losing battle given the maturity of the belt that youre mining
1238225 without wanting to just preach our story i think youve got to go to new jurisdictions

1238255 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1238256 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1238257 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1238258 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1238259 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception

1238276 i did make it clear to the team that i wouldnt be coming back this season after the olympics
1238277 i want them to be able to get a team together and didnt want to leave any doors open
1238278 i wanted to make sure they had their opportunity to get a full strength team and not wait for anyone
1238279 its disappointing but it gave me the opportunity to prepare for this major event
1238280 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1238281 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1238282 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1238283 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1238284 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1238285 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1238286 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1238287 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1238288 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1238289 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1238290 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1238291 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1238292 lucs a standup guy and i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal
1238293 and were behind steve hes still one of ours i have a daughter and if she does something that i dont like of course im going to be mad but at the end of the day shes still my daughter and im still going to love her hes still part of this team and hes still our family so were still behind him
1238294 they cannot change their own rules thats an old rule in the ca regardless if the ponente is transferred to another division or not the case will always be with him unless he inhibits himself since roxas was transferred to the 8th division ultimately those that belong to the said division would be deliberating the case so justice sabio was really out of the picture

1238297 the state lake improvement fund bill was passed so that tax monies from boat fuel could be used for safety improvements on the lakes for better law enforcement and boating access these safety improvements now cannot be made and we are forced to move the money to the general fund for other uses

1238329 men der snyder statistikken lidt for hvis man kigger p hvad det er for en type sommerhuse der er blevet handlet s er det typisk de meget billige i prisklassen fra 600 000 kroner til en million kroner og det p virker s den gennemsnitlige kvadratmeterpris men hvis man kigger p sommerhuse der koster over en million kroner s er de meget vanskelige at s lge der er faktisk ingen eftersp rgsel

1238356 she then reapplied in 1997 again claiming to be a u s citizen and was again given a voter card which was again cancelled records show she was able to vote at least four times in general and primary elections
1238357 elections decided by one two or just a handful of votes
1238358 from a relatively small universe of individuals legal immigrants who seek to become citizens these numbers do not tell us how many illegal immigrants have regis tered and voted
1238359 any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate for the office of president vice president presidential elector
1238360 in order to register to vote or to vote in any federal state or local election including an initiative recall or referendum
1238361 are you a citizen of the united states of america
1238362 provide the appli cant with an opportunity to complete the form in a timely manner to allow for the completion of the registration form
1238363 im much better mum still a little bit sick but much better
1238364 sorry sweetie but if youre sick you have to stay in bed amp rest it really is the best thing unless of course you are feeling better amp want to get dressed amp go to school
1238365 we make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give
1238366 losing someone you love is difficult enough but losing someone to an unwarranted horrific act of violence is beyond words
1238367 over the next few years we dealt with our grief while working very hard to find the killer family and friends joined us in passing out thousands of fliers a reward was offered billboards were posted across the area detectives with the knox county sheriffs department worked extremely hard to solve the crime and all the while sheriff tim hutchison refused to accept outside assistance from the tbi and other outlets that could have in our honest opinion helped immensely
1238368 once tim hutchison was replaced by j j jones we were hopeful that the new sheriff would be more willing to accept the assistance of outside resources
1238369 he was not instead we felt that sheriff jones was continuing along the same path as mr hutchison even still we were not deterred in our effort to find justice for our daughter we stayed true to our mission of keeping johnias case in the public eye in hopes that someone would finally come forward with the information we were so desperately seeking and thankfully that day finally arrived
1238370 though this is still a very difficult and heartbreaking time in our lives the only thing i can now do is try to help others
1238371 losing someone you love is beyond words and thats something that you cannot change but if you ever lose someone to a violent crime you shouldnt have to struggle with a system that should be working with and not against you you do have a say in changing the system
1238372 being sheriff should not be about politics being sheriff should be about doing everything in your power to ensure the safety and harmony of the community the sheriff should be accountable to the citizens who have entrusted them with this very important position
1238373 this is why i am supporting randy tyree in the race for knox county sheriff while i dont live in knoxville i still have family there and i believe its time for a change
1238374 two detectives were assigned full time to the johnia berry case they had no other duties for three years except to solve this case i told joan berry it would be solved and it was as i sympathize with the berry family over the loss of their daughter this is just another desperate attempt by tyree to gain free media time
1238375 this is parsing words out of campaign appearances to an unreasonable degree
1238376 he has certainly im sure said things in town halls
1238377 with the acquisition of incando we now have the back end tools to engage consumers viewers and marketers in a multi branded multimedia online universe with compelling personalized experiences
1238378 everythings going to turn out okay i always say the lord doesnt give you more than you can handle
1238379 the engine nearly cuts out then goes back to normal then nearly cuts out then goes back to normal
1238380 hey happy birthday let me speak to to your wife
1238381 the art of living does not consist in preserving and clinging to a particular mode of happiness but in allowing happiness to change its form without being disappointed by the change happiness like a child must be allowed to grow up
1238382 is this black and white photo that of a sufi saint or a religious guru
1238383 no nor are they related to me these people made an impact on my life i am grateful to them
1238384 the man in the blue suit is bharat ratna jrd tata amp the black and white photo is of jamsetji tata
1238385 the great tatas have always been pioneers they are the people who started the basic infrastructure industries in india such as iron and steel chemicals textiles amp locomotives they have cared for higher education in india since 1900 and they were responsible for the establishment of the indian institute of science fortunately i study there but i am surprised how a company such as telco is discriminating on the basis of gender
1238386 do you know why we said lady candidates need not apply
1238387 but you must start somewhere otherwise no woman will ever be able to work in your factories
1238388 jeh thats what his close associates called him this young woman is an engineer and that too a postgraduate she is the first woman to work on the telco shop floor

1238393 it was nice hearing about jeh from you the sad part is that hes not alive to see you today

1238398 mereka menunaikan nadzar dan takut akan suatu hari yang azabnya merata dimana mana
1238399 kalau seandainya sakit saya disembuhkan allah maka saya akan bersedekah
1238400 kalau si fulan datang dengan keadaan begini maka saya akan begini
1238401 tidak datang nazar itu atas anak cucu adam dengan sesuatu yang belum saya takdirkan dengan arti lain nazar itu tidak akan merubah qadha dan qadhar allah seperti hadits rasulullah
1238402 nazar itu ada 2 apabila nazar itu benar untuk allah maka kafarahnya wajib ditunaikan tapi jika nazar itu untuk syaithan seperti mengandung kesyirikan bidah dan sebagainya maka tidak boleh dikerjakan dan diwajibkan atasnya kafaratul yamin dijelaskan oleh syaikh salim al hilali dalam kitab beliau bahjah
1238403 apa apa yang tidak pernah mendatangi saya sebelumnya kata rasulullah dari lafaz yang lain jangan kamu bernazar karena sesungguhnya nazar itu tidak akan mempengaruhi qadha dan qadhar allah sedikitpun dan sesungguhnya nazar itu tidak akan keluar kecuali dari orang yang bakhil
1238404 larangan ini misalnya seseorang mengatakan jka saya sembuh maka saya akan bersedekah
1238405 tidak keluar dari orang yang bakhil apa apa dimana orang bakhil itu tidak mengeluarkannya

1238410 blind faith in the hands of a publisher is a bad thing
1238411 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1238412 we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we really need to look at this strategically
1238413 refinement of his policy on the use of the strategic petroleum reserve
1238414 household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1238415 what women and girls in canada need are prevention and education programs specific for women and girls female condoms and more research for microbicides
1238416 our objective should be to stop this virus and the best way to do so is with a vaccine
1238417 we need to get away from this home run mentality to research science is incremental
1238418 vaccine research is no longer a mom and pop shop it requires international consortia and a global strategic plan
1238419 microbicide development is a series of barriers no pun intended
1238420 we need a microbicide that is not coitally dependent we need to get protection away from the sex act like weve done with oral contraception for women
1238421 women are disproportionately infected with hiv thats because women still have to ask permission to protect themselves against hiv
1238422 may be extremely valuable and significantly increase stockholder value as a separate business
1238423 i feel like mr icahn is hoping bristol would rather pay up for imclone than get into some sort of legal battle over who has rights to 11f8 assuming it could turn out to be a next generation erbitux
1238424 in many ways were just too fixated on the near term gyrations which are impossible to explain
1238425 theres no question theres been a price response its just what is the permanence of that price response
1238426 the pullback does not seem to have been sufficient yet to cause people to change a lot of their expectations as to what the future will hold
1238427 a good bellwether is how seriously policy makers are taking this issue and that does not seem to have diminished
1238428 if oil prices drop youre going to see the industrialization in developing countries rev up
1238429 id almost say it will go back to 140 but the question is when in the broader picture its really important to recognize that the softening in demand is the result of the business cycle
1238430 he said there is a drug problem that stops everything nobody can trust
1238431 for example if we ask for a visa to take our fruit to europe that will be one of the issues
1238432 i dont want to make a comment on that you know you heard thats the way it was these are all political issues none of these issues are legal drugs these are accusations these are perceptions theres no proof for the last seven years
1238433 they say the russian president says to build a wall around afghanistan to stop drugs
1238434 you know the people who are sitting in that room had family members killed by the russians and they had wounds on their bodies from the russian times
1238435 they didnt take it well the elders the members of the provincial shura council they were very unhappy about this they didnt like the russian example
1238436 he mr karzai perceives that there are certain people he cannot crack down on and that it is better to tolerate a certain level of corruption than to take an aggressive stand and lose power
1238437 he has decided not to lose power trying to do things that might fail disastrously
1238438 we dont want any residents who might be eligible to miss out on valuable disaster assistance that could help them get back on their feet
1238439 if disaster affected texans are in doubt they should apply for assistance and fema will determine their eligibility

1238501 he thought he was becoming physically weak and since he was a technical expert he would lose his job if he lost his job he felt there would be no reason to live
1238502 he skipped work for a few days and rejoined a couple of days back after much persuasion from his colleagues and family members

1238504 i had a hard time with it a lot of depression i sat around waiting for life to stop for me
1238505 i cant pick things up off the ground anymore so she is there for me to do that
1238506 we are not really asking them to think like a human we are only asking them not to think like a dog to have the natural instincts of chasing someone
1238507 probably the number one reason i have heard is that they dont want to take the dog away from someone they think would need the dog more which is not the case
1238508 thats exactly what happens when we get filled up with emotion we cant handle
1238509 kids teenagers everyone impacted those who were really close to these individuals they need that stability
1238510 were going to do what we have to do to meet your needs

1238520 their deposits will continue to remain insured by the fdic
1238521 there really is no need for customers to do anything they should look at it as business as usual and as just a change of ownership
1238522 we think its a good news story for the depositors of the bank not a penny will be lost
1238523 there is no financial destruction to the local community and we are very lucky the fdic approached it that way
1238524 in reality most financial institutions in nevada are pretty sound
1238525 if i show you an audio visual object that deafens you or blinds you under the pretext of convincing you of a beautiful or good idea i cant even convey the idea to you because it must be perceived by the senses i have just diminished so i will only succeed in making you more unconscious

1238532 thats the hard part but the good part is that youll have all these options
1238533 he said he thinks he can hit righthanded right now thats a good thing
1238534 if hes feeling good enough to hit righthanded maybe after a few more days hes going to come out and go hey this feels ok a little tape job and go out there and see what he can do
1238535 if this is something that he cant do any more damage to can play through it then he will if theres a risk of him hurting himself even more then we will not take that risk
1238536 one thing that ive noticed over the four years i have been here is that ive been amazed as how many times we have had guys go down and have somebody else come in and step in for those guys and get big hits

1238755 ballet is truly a heavenly art form the dancers stretch themselves upward to the ultimate degree to reach god in heaven ballet uses the entire body as an instrument to express mans aspiration toward god in this sense it is the ultimate expression of artistic beauty
1238756 at the international ballet competition in varna bulgaria considered by many the olympics of ballet the unprecedented has happened for the first time in the competitions 320 year history american dancers won the gold medals in both mens and womens junior divisions and to sharpen the surprise not only were the two winners rasta thomas 15 and michelle wiles 16 both from the washington area but they also train at the same school the kirov academy of ballet

1238768 the whole scandinavian melancholy thing if theres a dark edge to my music i think it comes from that
1238769 i was into nature and wildlife and didnt feel the need to speak to people or do a lot of social things
1238770 suddenly it just all changed and i needed to be in the rush of social activity the pulse of the city and all of that
1238771 but then this finnish family from helsinki moved there and i started working as a babysitter for them every time i went back home i was able to borrow some of their albums the father had the biggest collection of records ive ever seen and so through him i got into listening to rock music the first batch of albums i borrowed i remember it well it was like a religious epiphany they included jimi hendrix janis joplin television talking heads flaming lips kate bush and bob dylan

1238773 once i was away from the family home i didnt have to work in opposition to them anymore i was on my own and i could frame that within a working studying structure they could advise me for sure but they couldnt make decisions for me which is maybe why im here today besides at the colleges in bergen and uppsala i couldnt escape from playing music or performing i played music all day and lived a generally crazy life it was wonderful
1238774 i think i have a very shy introverted side and a very impulsive side that i cant really control
1238775 i dont think that people buy tickets to our shows to see me crack my head open or anything like that it isnt about that yes they hear that i can react in certain ways on stage but when they see me they start to realise it isnt just about the performance its about approaching music in an honest and natural way not formulaic

1238781 a very high proportion however of the material from departments and agencies carries a security classification which limits the extent to which it can be shown to other people or disclosed generally the originating agency alone has the authority to remove the classification and the inquiry has not been given authority to publish those which are classified
1238782 while the documents have in the main been delivered to the inquiry gaining access to the documents has involved a protracted period of negotiation
1238783 faced with the need to advance the investigation which has already been significantly delayed i felt that i had no choice

1238788 when the world media was portraying kenya as a country engulfed by ethnic hatred and mass violence there were many people in all walks of society whose first thought was what can we do to help in this crisis
1238789 we as writers could not have escaped that question we had to do something and the only skill we could use to help our people was to write
1238790 inaccurate reporting by the international media telling the typical dark continent stories warranted a corrective response from kenyan writers we were not journalists but we could adapt our skills to respond to what we found to be ill informed stereotypical and misleading coverage of the violence by reporters who barely knew the country and its people
1238791 we were the first anywhere to wade into the thick of analysis and discussion during the conflict at a time when sensational dehumanising images were conveying a simplistic story of barbarism to the world
1238792 the western media never show the mutilated blood soaked bodies of the victims of terrorist attacks of say september 11 or of the 2005 london bombings why take a different approach to kenyas tragedy
1238793 these sociological and psychological factors were beyond the grasp of the international media which focused on the sensational and the stereotypical
1238794 there was a forest warder who risked his life by taking in 847 refugees at the height of the violence
1238795 all these stories have one thing in common the people who cared looked beyond tribe and race and saw the common humanity of people in need
1238796 gratitude research is beginning to suggest that feelings of thankfulness have tremendous positive value in helping people cope with daily problems especially stress
1238797 high energy positive moods a greater sense of feeling connected to others more optimistic ratings of ones life and better sleep duration and sleep quality relative to a control group
1238798 gratitude by contrast is a deepened appreciation of circumstances in your life right now vs where you want to be
1238799 feeling gratitude reduces unpleasant feelings like envy resentment and regret that rob people of happiness
1238800 its been so long must be over a year im getting desperate joe dont you love me
1238801 by the late 1700s the art of wood seasoning gave way to the art of artificial preservation
1238802 there are certain neurotransmitters and hormones such as melatonin that we know are susceptible to light induced changes and influence behavior
1238803 melatonin seems to exert broader roles in mood early morning exposure to intense light such as by walking outside for 20 minutes can also reset the bodys production of melatonin so it increases as it should in the evening
1238804 selecting healthier foods spending more time outdoors and taking one or two natural anti depressant nutrients can part the emotional clouds and brighten your life
1238805 the different species used for oil production yield different compositions of oils and thus different scents moroccan rose oil rosa centifolia is rich in phenylethanol 63 but contains less citronellol 10 15 geraniol and nerol 8 the bulgarian type rosa damascena is naturally rich in citronellol 35 55 geraniol and nerol 40 but only 2 phenylethanol although traditionally rosa gallica supplied the demand for rose petals used for medicinal purposes it is no longer possible to ascertain the exact species of red roses in circulation in the trade today rose petals used medicinally should be of a healthy deep crimson colour and have a strongly aromatic scent
1238806 september is a beautiful month around here but it is also fruit fly month
1238807 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1238808 so buy less means people loose jobs then the economy will fall and people will go on welfare and maybe they will start stealing for ways to make money for food so yes lets buy less
1238809 only after the last tree has been cut down only after the last river has been poisoned only after the last fish has been caught only then will you find that money cannot be eaten
1238810 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1238811 shiloh calls them her babies she and z pick out their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mommies
1238812 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1238813 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1238814 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1238815 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1238816 one of the things that we forget because it seems new to us again with dean and obama is the importance of small funders
1238817 if you look for example at carters 1976 campaign and reagans 1980 campaign you see campaigns that are very much built off of small contributions of 500 or below
1238818 i was a skeptic about the effectiveness of the internet
1238819 in the past the money from small contributions typically has been too little too late now you could almost manage a campaign off of these small internet driven contributions they are a major source of revenue
1238820 what weve found so far is that in general those who enroll in an ida program have slightly more or better resources than those who do not weve also found that in arkansas low income african americans are much more likely to access an ida program than they are public assistance programs
1238821 the purpose of this feasibility study was to provide initial proof of concept data and insights
1238822 the overall results are very encouraging and indicate a favorable outcome with many types of tags and readers this project has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of rfid for specific applications and has the potential to satisfy many common use cases especially inventory management
1238823 it suggested influence on read rates from such things as tag type reader type tag location fixture type and number of items on a fixture

1238825 a walk on role in a death by killer tomato scene
1238826 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
1238827 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1238828 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1238829 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to diabetes out of control and congestive heart failure because of hypertension
1238830 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
1238831 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
1238832 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1238833 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
1238834 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
1238835 as long as it used in accordance with the regulations we have concluded its safe

1238844 the visionary lies to himself the liar only to others
1238845 to forget ones purpose is the commonest form of stupidity
1238846 to predict the behavior of ordinary people in advance you only have to assume that they will always try to escape a disagreeable situation with the smallest possible expenditure of intelligence

1238868 i remember going out for the track team when i was 9 years old and being the champion girl from my class

1238870 sanya is similar now this season to where she was in 2006 before the behcets
1238871 it blows my mind to think of what she was able to accomplish with all of the physical problems she had a year ago and now we havent missed any training her medication is working and i think shes back on track to where she wants to go
1238872 olympic relay gold medalist darold williamson said i was the first female athlete that coach hart has really opened up to i guess none of the other girls had taken the time to become a friend to him as well as an athlete i think since we have such a great relationship he invests more time in me and it shows on the track
1238873 the medication ive been taking since the new year has made a world of difference i havent had a flare up since jan 1 which i think is a miracle
1238874 at the start of the season which is april we did see an impact for the months of april and may
1238875 what we found was instead of coming up ahead of time people were trying to plan more but now this summer since june our number of reservations is about the same as last year

1239088 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1239089 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1239090 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1239091 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning

1239095 enoch walked with haelohiym and he was not for elohiym took him
1239096 and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying and behold yehvah cometh with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgement upon all and to destroy all the ungodly and to convict all flesh of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him
1239097 this is the son of man who has righteousness and with whom righteousness dwells and who will reveal all the treasures of that which is concealed for yehvah of spirits has chosen him and through uprightness his lot has surpassed all others before yehvah of spirits forever
1239098 and from then on i will not have mercy on them
1239099 all these things which you have seen serve the authority of his messiah so that he may be strong and powerful on the earth
1239100 wait a little and you will see and everything which is secret which yehvah of spirits has established will be revealed to you 6 and these mountains that you have seen the mountain of iron and the mountain of copper and the mountain of silver and the mountain of gold and the mountain of soft metal and the mountain of lead all these in front of the chosen one will be like wax before fire and like the water that comes down from above onto these mountains they will be weak under his feet 7 and it will come to pass in those days that neither by gold nor by silver will men save themselves they will be unable to save themselves or to flee 8 and there will be neither iron for war nor material for a breastplate bronze will be no use and tin will be of no use and will count for nothing and lead will not be wanted 9 all these will be wiped out and destroyed from the face of the earth when the chosen one appears in front of yehvah of spirits
1239101 they are preparing these for the kings and the powerful of this earth so that by means of them they may be destroyed 6 and after this the righteous and chosen one will cause the house of his congregation to appear from then on in the name yehvah of spirits they will not be hindered 7 and in front of him these mountains will not be firm like the earth and the hills will be like a spring of water and the righteous will have rest from the ill treatment of the sinners
1239102 these are being prepared for the hosts of azazel so that they may take them and throw them into the lowest part of hell and they will cover their jaws with rough stones the adonay of spirits commanded
1239103 open your eyes and raise your horns if you are able to acknowledge the chosen one
1239104 blessed be yehvah of spirits and yehvah of kings yehvah of the mighty and yehvah of the rich and yehvah of glory and yehvah of wisdom 3 and everything secret is clear in front of you and your power is for all generations and your glory is forever and ever deep and without number are all your secrets and your righteousness is beyond reckoning 4 now we realize that we ought to praise and bless yehvah of kings and the one who is king over all kings
1239105 would that we might be given a respite so that we might praise and thank and bless him and make our confession in front of his glory 6 and now we long for a respite but do not find it we are driven off and do not obtain it and the light has passed away from before us and darkness will be our dwelling forever and ever 7 for we have not made our confession before him and we have not praised the name of yehvah of kings and we have not praised yehvah for all his works but our hopes have been on the sceptre of our kingdom and of our glory 8 and on the day of our affliction and distress he does not save us and we find no respite to make our confession that our yehvah is faithful in all his doings and in all his judgments and his justice and that his judgments show no respect for persons 9 and we pass away from in front of him because of all our works and all our sins have been counted exactly
1239106 our souls are sated with possessions gained through iniquity but they do not prevent our going down into the flames of the torment of sheol
1239107 this is the law and the judgment for the mighty and the kings and the exalted and for those who possess the dry ground in front of yehvah of spirits

1239126 republican sen john mccain criticized sen barack obamas call for a windfall profits tax on the oil industry on tuesday despite leaving the door open to the same idea last month mccain criticized obama his democratic rival repeatedly in excerpts of a speech planned for delivery tuesday evening he cited obamas advocacy of a tax on excess oil industry profits as well as the democrats vote for president bushs energy legislation in 2005 mccain reserved his sharpest words for the windfall profits tax if that plan sounds familiar its because that was president carters big idea too im all for recycling but its better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s mccain said in the excerpts
1239127 would deliver a 3 8 billion tax cut to the five largest american oil companies

1239147 i have a tendency when i take a lot of time off to play really well in my upcoming tournament
1239148 when i was practicing at home and then when i came out here i felt very confident in my game i was striking the ball really well and my big thing always is reading putts and putting the right speed on them and i just had both of them together today and that equates to a low score
1239149 this might sound conceited but ive kind of gotten used to it in college
1239150 ive had to play with those kind of expectations and that kind of pressure so this is just another tournament where thats the case so ive gotten used to it by now i wouldnt want it any other way
1239151 i mean i love this tournament they always set it up tough so to play well on a course like this feels great
1239152 ive just been practicing a lot and grinding on my short game which was key here
1239153 i think i put a lot of pressure on myself and i came out here in the practice rounds and i was like man this course is tough i kind of psyched myself out but i was trying to go the other way last night i was like oh i can score well and then i started out with two birdies today and that just got my mindset in the right place and i was more comfortable playing off of that
1239154 it was a little embarrassing because it hit the tree and literally bounced about 100 yards back so it was maybe 70 yards off the tee

1239166 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small

1239196 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
1239197 petition was signed by 18 000 scientists including thousands of meteorologists climatologists and atmospheric scientists
1239198 we urge the united states government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in kyoto japan in december 1997 and any other similar proposals
1239199 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate moreover there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environment of the earth
1239200 top court slaps epa white house it rules agency has duty to regulate co2 emissions
1239201 the supreme court ruled monday in what amounts to a rebuke of the bush administration that the environmental protection agency has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide from automobile emissions and that it has shirked its duty in not doing so
1239202 in a 5 4 decision the court found that the clean air act expressly authorizes the epa to regulate carbon dioxide emissions contrary to the epas contention and that if the agency still insists that it does not want to regulate those emissions it must give better reasons than the
1239203 the decision is surely not the last word in the continuing debate over the effects of global warming and what can or should be done about it
1239204 most climatologists agree that the earths temperature has increased about a degree over the past century
1239205 among the many findings that dispute environmentalists claims manmade carbon dioxide emissions are roughly 5 percent of the total the rest are from natural sources such as volcanoes dying vegetation and animals
1239206 throughout the earths billions of years there have been countless periods of global warming and cooling
1239207 theres a much more important issue that poses an even greater danger to mankind
1239208 scientists who dissent from the alarmism have seen their funds disappear their work derided and themselves labeled as industry stooges

1239211 when weve finally gotten serious about global warming when the impacts are really hitting us and were in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage we should have war crimes trials for these bastards some sort of climate nuremberg
1239212 there are literally billions of taxpayer dollars being handed out to global warming alarmists not to mention their dream of controlling our lives their agenda is threatened by dissent they have the politicians ear not we who will suffer if they have their way
1239213 this mammoth program agenda 21 for global social engineering and eco tyranny is a massive blueprint for regimenting all life on planet earth in the 21st century in the name of protecting the environment
1239214 effective execution of agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources
1239215 there are specific actions which are intended to be undertaken by multinational corporations and entrepreneurs by financial institutions and individual investors by high tech companies and indigenous people by workers and labor unions by farmers and consumers by students and schools by governments and legislators by scientists by women by children in short by every person on earth
1239216 glaciers expand and contract all the time and while some glaciers are shrinking at present others are growing
1239217 franz josef glacier guides base manager tom arnold estimated the franz josef and the fox had advanced hundreds of meters in the past year
1239218 that out of 9 575 glaciers in india till date research has been conducted only on about 50 nearly 200 years data has shown that nothing abnormal has occurred in any of these glaciers
1239219 why the discrepancy with earlier reports about massive melting in the himalayas
1239220 claims of global warming causing glacier melt in the himalayas are based on wrong assumptions
1239221 one of the central claims made by those worried about global warming is that greenlands glaciers are melting rapidly
1239222 i think that there are unpleasant surprises as we move into the 21st century
1239223 there are surprises but so far they are not that unpleasant
1239224 combined rate of mass loss doubled in less than a year in 2004 and then decreased in 2006 to near the previous rates
1239225 earth is not the only planet experiencing warmer temperatures reported a february 28 national geographic news online article entitled
1239226 mars too appears to be enjoying more mild and balmy temperatures
1239227 in 2005 data from nasas mars global surveyor and odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide ice caps near mars south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row
1239228 what is causing this warming national geographic quoted habibullo abdussamatov head of space research at pulkovo astronomical observatory in russia as saying that a long term increase in solar irradiance is heating both earth and mars
1239229 abdussamatovs views are completely at odds with the mainstream scientific opinion
1239230 though the effect of changing solar intensity on planetary temperatures may be considered controversial surely no one would quibble with the fact that carbon dioxide emissions on earth cannot be causing global warming on mars
1239231 no human community should be larger than 20 000 people we need to radically and intelligently reduce human population to fewer then one billion mankind is the aida of the earth
1239232 global warming has become a big ticket item in the eyes of its supporters at stake are research funds jobs and the ability to control lives all over the globe most climatologists agree that over the past century the earths average temperature has risen about one degree celsius
1239233 the controversy centers around the source of the temperature change man made or natural causes global warming alarmists hold the view that its man made emissions of co2 that are driving climate change and they seek to suppress any dissent suggesting other causes
1239234 take this warning from me marlo it is my intention to destroy your career as a liar if you produce one more editorial against climate change i will launch a campaign against your professional integrity i will call you a liar and charlatan to the harvard community of which you and i are members i will call you out as a man who has been bought by corporate america go ahead guy take me on

1239240 when weve finally gotten serious about global warming when the impacts are really hitting us and were in a full worldwide scramble to minimize the damage we should have war crimes trials for these bastards some sort of climate nuremberg
1239241 global warming driven by greenhouse gas pollution but ultimately by greed racism and lying is killing our planet
1239242 our planet the earth is under acute threat from climate criminals threatening the third world with climate genocide and the biosphere with terracide the killing of our planet
1239243 this kind of suppression of different ideas and dissent is simply the tip of a much larger iceberg that has many of its roots on todays college campuses
1239244 if you repeat a lie often enough it becomes the truth
1239245 back in the 1950s when i was just a small boy there was already a lot of talk about how the world would soon run out of oil
1239246 at the same time our technology brought forth a bright new hope nuclear power which was advertised as being able to create such electricity
1239247 with the collapse of communism still more than a generation away the pubescent environmental movement was desperately searching for targets about which to invoke the principle of gloom and doom looking for converts from the ranks of the idealists the do gooders and the gullible
1239248 they were not without allies the existing energy establishment wasnt too happy about a competitor that could with one gram of uranium replace 10 000 tons of coal without discharging noxious effluents an enormous investment in carbon combustion was at risk
1239249 the attack was slow and awkward at first but then an unavoidable consequence inherent in technology provided all the ammunition they needed to destroy the industry something broke
1239250 of course there was the unfortunate event at chernobyl but this happened after nuclear power was already pretty much dead in america
1239251 the environmentalists then went on to suppress all avenues of disposal for the waste products of atomic reactions a feat exploited by cynical upwardly mobile politicians
1239252 nuclear energy is the one and only technology with the proven capability to eliminate our reliance on imported oil if it had been fully developed instead of irrationally suppressed we wouldnt need to be burning polluting substances to heat our homes or to travel
1239253 without imports the dictators and despots who hate america would no longer be collecting our cash to use against us the radical muslims would have had far less reason to attack us since their main grievance is the presence of the infidel on their holy lands
1239254 the war in iraq is about oil the very same oil upon which our country is now dependent the environmental cabal in its endless lust to force its world view on america created the conditions that made conflict and war inevitable this state of affairs will continue as long as real energy independence is suppressed

1239260 since i first started working at heal the bay 20 years ago newspaper media has been experiencing a slow and painful death the first casualty was the herald examiner followed by the outlook the reader and now the slow dismantling of the once highly respected los angeles times now it is nearly impossible to get a newspaper to run an investigative piece on the environment in la let alone cover the day to day decisions that continue to erode our local quality of life

1239306 although siguro now its taking its toll kung anuman yung mga pinigil ko na damdamin na medyo nararamdaman ko ngayon physically din yung parang wala ka parang there will always be an emptiness inside
1239307 the more na naging mas alam namin kung ano kung nasaan yung bawat isa its about grieving what were coping how can we solve this kasi hindi naman minamadali lahat ang buhay
1239308 both networks abs cbn and gma may offers but i will finalize everything mid august siguro of course im moving on kasi siyempre i feel that parang sa lahat ng mga pangyayari although lalo na eto yung time days in my life na parang gusto ko munang huwag magkaroon ng showiz oriented talk show

1239312 wala pa e wala pa kong idea actually kinausap naman ako ni direk louie ignacio naaliw naman ako ang galing ang ganda
1239313 huwag na po yun akin na lang yun basta ano nag iisip ako at alam ko kung paano ko hawakan ang pera ko sa mabuting paraan at para sa future ko
1239314 actually po hindi business e may mga lupa investment po basta marami akong mga plano sa buhay siguro hindi naman mawawala kung ilalagay ko sa bangko at least may interest pa kung ita time deposit ko siya hinay hinay lang mahirap din naman kasi yung bili ako nito bili ako nun at saka basta naman may pera madaling bumili kahit na ano pa ang gusto mo
1239315 sabi nga ni direk joyce bernal sa akin ang business ko yung hitsura ko yung mukha ko na dapat kong alagaan ngayon kung wala na ako sa showbiz at ayaw ko na yun lang ang time na dapat mag business ako para ako mismo mai manage ko nang tama kasi kung ngayon wala raw po e
1239316 ang nabago lang palaging nagpapa develop ng picture pagdating sa akin anak pirmahan mo to parang lola naman ang dami naman so sige pirma pirma
1239317 ang sabi niya sa akin mahirap daw sa isang katulad niya na palaging nasa garden nag aalaga ng mga halaman at pagkatapos biglang sa condo lang siya nood ng tv so baka raw lalo lang siyang manghina
1239318 so pinabayaan ko siya yung normal na buhay niya ganoon pa rin siya nakakaalis pa rin siya nakakapunta pa rin siya kung saan saan nag a outing sila ng mga tropa niya ang tawag kasi nila sa kanya kapitana hanggang ngayon ganoon pa rin siya
1239319 in terms of intriga naman tanggap ko na yun palagi kahit ano naman ang sabihin ng mga tao sa akin wala akong magagawa bilang isang artista yun naman ang pinaka koneksiyon kung hindi ka artista kung simpleng tao ka lang wala naman sigurong ganoon
1239320 ito ang kailangan kong bayaran sa pagiging ako yung simpleng intrigang yan pero wala akong magagawa ron as long as wala akong natatapakang tao marami akong napapaligaya at alam ko na totoo ako sa sarili ko lalo na ang pamilya ko na kilalang kilala ko solved na ako ron
1239321 di ba nga palagi kong sinasabi pulaan na ako ng ibang tao sabihin na nila ang gusto nilang sabihin sa akin ang importante sa akin malinis ang puso ko at wala akong sinasagasaan okey na ko ron

1239324 are you actually implying that the law of the land can so easily be dodged and manipulated
1239325 on the one hand the sif torchbearers stridently proclaim that only a small percentage of cases actually end in indictment for the husband in a dowry related case and now all of a sudden you are painting a picture which conveys just the opposite
1239326 are you actually implying that the law of the land can so easily be dodged and manipulated
1239327 i dont agree with those who say that amit had no recourse if in fact he had incriminating evidence against her then it would have been held valid in any court of law divorce would have been granted
1239328 on the one hand the sif torchbearers stridently proclaim that only a small percentage of cases actually end in indictment for the husband in a dowry related case and now all of a sudden you are painting a picture which conveys just the opposite
1239329 divorce would have taken years to settle he had to shell out lot on judiciary lawyers after that he has to pay alimony to his wife for her lifetime his wife would have earning well and enjoying life with her new boyfriend and getting all the benifits from her former husband
1239330 generally husbands have to shell out anything from 5 lakhs to 4 crores to the wife to
1239331 i will always be sorry that you suffered so much and did not even think of burdening us with your pain i wish i could take away some of your pain as kids when a guy used to fight with you i used to pull his hair hit him do evrything to take him off you i wish you had told me about your sufferings i would have fought the world for you baby
1239332 if amits family were arrogant they would have been issuing statements in media like rinkus family
1239333 i had an intuition that if i applied for a divorce she wouldaccuse my family of dowry harassment
1239334 he told me his wife was involved with someone i asked him to come over the same day if he was disturbed but he said he would come with rinku on monday
1239335 i came to know about the party from his friend raoul it is possible amit turned wild after hearing the insults and decided to kill his wife
1239336 raoul called me up and sought my help for amit
1239337 isnt it little surprising that the statement made by bangalore police about the investigation got published only in one mumbai newspaper
1239338 well it seems tape recorded conversations of rinku with her lover s have been recovered from amits laptop and the police out here is investigating it
1239339 i wonder what was rinkus motive in marrying him after all it was her choice
1239340 a guy like amit who is so successful in life i was kind of perplexed with that statement how would you characterize a guy like him being successful in life you must be really setting some low standards on that
1239341 amit seemed very controlling and short tempered in his approach towards his marriage issues
1239342 amit when i am ready for a divorce i will ask for it only once and i will mean it rather than keep on callously using it as a threat the way you do when we have an argument
1239343 companies are turning to these vast amounts of data that they have and using analytics to help forecast the future predict customer behaviour
1239344 weve done some really interesting work in the retail space
1239345 if youve got 500 stores in canada and you price each item each day how do you do that when youve got 200 000 or 300 000 different items at each store these are some very large research problems that were dealing with and the retailers are now all realizing that they need to turn more to analytics to help them with the bottom line
1239346 we continue to work with teradata trying to get them to loosen up on their user defined functions or udfs as we call them this allows us to put our code down on their compute nodes
1239347 not a whole lot has changed since i first started as a programmer back in the late 60s programming is still pretty much the same its really funny when the first ibm displays came out the 3270s we busily worked on making sure our software ran interactively the 3270s we called dumb terminals its funny how weve come almost full circle weve come from that to the desktop computing and now were shifting back to the dumb terminal approach but now were using laptops that display a browser
1239348 im looking forward to getting over there and trying to make it a success
1239349 he andrews is a very astute horseman he has a very good strike rate of winners to runners im looking forward to joining the stable

1239351 with the winter basically behind us and the spring here it was going to be too tough to get good and consistent rides in the city
1239352 there are just so many top riders in melbourne youre even riding against group one jockeys in the bush in victoria
1239353 over the past month ive ridden 12 or 13 winners and its just so hard to keep getting the good rides
1239354 i currently claim 2 in the city and i can ride another 19 before it drops to 1 5 kgs
1239355 ang daming artista dito pero parang equal naman ang billboards everyone really had a billboard me i can say i am happy in bench i do
1239356 ang balita ko walang pangalan yata lahat ng artista yun ang sinabi ng tao dun because even me wala rin akong pangalan i heard and i think maybe dingdong dantes had yung trainor ko its not like make up kaunting darkener for my skin
1239357 i wanna thank ate kris for the comment i also wanna thank everyone for making me feel comfortable i was real shy but it was fun at the same time i tried to work out that week i tried to go to gym as much as i could i tried to work out for it
1239358 mayroon pa ring kaba nagna numb yung katawan ko siguro napansin ng mga tao na hindi ako masyadong kumportable na nahihiya pa ako but it was really a good feeling knowing that if youre really nervous tapos you dont hear anything mas lalo ka yatang kakabahan its really a good warm welcome or good response i guess

1239361 he displays the combination of throwing the football accurately and also running effectively and he proved that in games last season he has a lot of things to work on but thats why were out here practicing
1239362 i am ready to help this football team get more victories any way i can and we are a little thin over at safety
1239363 omar and mike clausen will take care of things on offense and now ill help the other side of the ball
1239364 he has an opportunity to compete to start on defense and help this team be successful we want to put our best players on the field and there is a history of converted quarterbacks making the move over to safety we feel this will be a great thing for our team

1239369 kasi unang una iba yong tagalog na conversation iba yong tagalog pag tv
1239370 when i auditioned for philippine idol i didnt have time to have those thoughts hindi ako kinabahan kasi wala akong time kabahan e ito naghintay ako ng mga 30 minutes habang sine set up tapos dalawang oras yong audition so mahaba so all of these thoughts were in my head na i felt that i totally screwed up
1239371 kasi ang alam ko the contestants were subjected to stunts ang akin ang audition ko which took about two hours consisted of doing spiels and how i handle the simple stunts so naka encounter din ako ng mga daga ng mga centipede and those big yong bundok cockroach yan yong mga naka engkuwentro ko habang nag i spiel ako e ginagapangan ako ng mga insekto yon lang yong extent nung sa akin kasi yong sa contestants mas grabe
1239372 one month yong actual contest period pero well have a few days before that pa e na immersion pa
1239373 not with her schedule and the amount of time that it takes to get to argentina
1239374 even if she takes a week off from work travel to argentina takes two days and travel back is two days so that leaves her with three solid days to stay in argentina which i dont think really is worth the hassle
1239375 napagdaanan na namin yang mga ganyang thoughts nung first year of the relationship
1239376 definitely its not going to happen this year i mean siyempre ako gusto ko next year e hindi naman namin alam kung ano yong mga trabaho namin we dont know if next year yong bahay yong kailangan yon yung definite na either masimulan this year or matapos by this year
1239377 sa totoo lang hindi pa namin napag uusapan dahil we got engaged nitong may lang we left for europe and then for the states again kumbaga the dust hasnt settled so hindi pa kami bumabalik sa normal routine namin and ito nga im leaving for argentina
1239378 ang fear namin kasi pag usapan habang nakabakasyon kami kung ano man yong mapag usapan namin doon baka produkto lang yon ng pag i enjoy namin at hindi totoo pero pagkabumalik na kami dito sa pilipinas na normal day in day out na yong trabaho namin and we actually decide within those parameters and conditions yon yong totoong desisyon e yon yong totoong usapan na matino so probably when we get back sa september tsaka lang din namin mapag uusapan yong specifics
1239379 it really depends on the couple and not the amount of time you spend engaged together
1239380 ako yong stand ko kasi diyan sa financial readiness is 10 million pesos enough is 100 million enough is 1 billion enough we never know we have these billionaires having problems with their marriage din di ba so theres never really financial readiness and really its more on the couples readiness to commit
1239381 wala sa utak ko yung kasal ngayon e so hindi ko pa rin talaga yun naiisip
1239382 yung nagsabi naman po sa akin na pakakasalan ako hindi rin ako sure if thats true ayoko naman pong i judge si dennis kasi siyempre hindi na namin pinag uusapan yon we only talk about calix so hindi talaga namin parang pinag uusapan yon
1239383 hindi naman siya nagkukulang kay calix hes dennis still a responsible dad
1239384 gusto ko lang i clear kasi nakakahiya naman kay renz at baka mailang na siya sa akin magkaklase po kami sa isang subject sa up and ka group ko siya so madalas kaming lumalabas ganun nagpupunta kami sa timezone
1239385 hindi kasi dapat manonood kami ng play noon tapos hindi na kami umabot
1239386 tsaka hindi naman siya nagme mention ng kahit na anong bagay tungkol doon sa girl so i dont think na important siya
1239387 masayang masaya rin kaming dalawa kasi nga natupad yung pangarap namin na finally nangyari yung pangarap namin na gumawa ng pelikula uniting the two networks abs cbn and gma 7
1239388 i mean isa siyang parang ang layo kung iisipin mo pero yun ang gusto naming nangyari and i think its also good fore the industry na sana tuluy tuloy na ganun na were breaking down the wall in between them na din were uniting the two networks and sana tuluy tuloy nga
1239389 kasi sa mga interviews ko before in the past lagi kong sinasabi yan e na sana makatrabaho ko yung mga artista sa kabila sana ganun at ngayon nangyari na so im very blessed im very thankful

1239571 perbuatan mana mana individu muslim sama ada pemimpin atau rakyat yang meletakkan kalungan bunga tabik hormat dan bertafakur yang dilakukan untuk tugu negara adalah bercanggah dengan prinsip prinsip akidah islam yang anti kepada sebarang unsur keberhalaan
1239572 perbuatan seperti itu seakan menjadikan tugu berkenaan berhala yang dihormati sekiranya pun pelakunya tidak mempunyai sebarang iktikad bahawa itu semua memberi manfaat dan mudarat maka perbuatan itu adalah sia sia dan bodoh ia tetap haram kerana meniru perbuatan musyrikin
1239573 jika pelaku beriktikad itu memberikan kemanfaatan kepada keamanan kedamaian ruh mereka yang telah meninggal dunia maka itu adalah perbuatan syirik yang jelas akidah islam menentang sebarang unsur keberhalaan
1239574 pemimpin atau sesiapa sahaja yang terlibat dalam perbuatan ini hendaklah bertaubat kepada allah dan kembali kepada akidah islam yang sebenar

1239579 therapists usually boast of their expertise the elaborate training they have undergone when discussing competence one often hears phrases like he has been well trained or he has had specialized training people are rather vague about the nature of psychotherapy training and therapists rarely encourage their patients to ask in any detail they dont for a good reason often their training is very modest the most elaborate and lengthy training programs are the classic psychoanalytic ones but this is not because of the amount of material that has to be covered i spent eight years in my psychoanalytic training in retrospect i feel i could have learned the basic ideas in about eight hours of concentrated reading
1239580 im still going to go to my office tomorrow and collect 50 an hour for talking with people
1239581 popularly it is believed that psychiatrists have the ability to see into our minds to understand the workings of the psyche and possibly even to predict our future behavior in reality of course they possess no such skills in truth there are very few illnesses in psychiatry and even fewer successful treatments in the postulating of hypothetical psychological and biochemical causative processes psychiatrists have tended to lay a smokescreen over the indubitable fact that in the real world it is not hard either to recognize or to treat the large majority of psychiatric illnesses it would take the intelligent layman a long weekend to learn how to do it
1239582 psychiatrists themselves acknowledge that their profession often smacks of modern alchemy full of jargon obfuscation and mystification but precious little real knowledge
1239583 most of the things ive done i think i could have done without the education
1239584 one of the worlds best known and most respected psychologists
1239585 i have argued in the past and quoted numerous experiments in support of these arguments that there is little evidence for the practical efficacy of psychotherapy the evidence on which these views are based is quite strong and is growing in strength every year
1239586 the effectiveness of psychotherapy has always been the specter at the wedding feast where thousands of psychiatrists psychoanalysts clinical psychologists social workers and others celebrate the happy event and pay no heed to the need for evidence for the premature crystallization of their spurious orthodoxies
1239587 there is no evidence that the benefits of psychotherapy are greater than those of placebo treatment
1239588 there are not enough therapists to listen even to a tiny fraction of these couples and besides the therapy is not too successful popular impression to the contrary when therapists such as marriage counselors hold meetings one primary topic almost invariably is why is their therapy effective in only a minority of cases
1239589 when control groups are included those patients recover to the same extent as those patients receiving treatment the enthusiastic belief expressed by therapists about their effectiveness in spite of the negative results illustrates the problem of the therapist who must make important human decisions many times each day he is in a very awkward position unless he believes in what he is doing
1239590 the therapy patients did not improve significantly more than did the waiting list controls
1239591 there is hardly any scientific evidence that psychotherapy for alcoholism or any other condition helps anyone
1239592 these misguided myth makers have encouraged us to believe that the infinite mysteries of the mind are as amenable to their professed expertise as plumbing or an automobile engine this is rubbish in fact these talk therapists practitioners of cosmetic psychiatry have no relevant training or skills in the art of living life it is remarkable that they have fooled us for so long cowed by their status as men of science deferring to their academic titles bewitched by the initials after their names we the gullible lap up their pretentious nonsense as if it were the gospel truth we must learn to recognize them for what they are possessors of no special knowledge of the human psyche who have nonetheless chosen to earn their living from the dissemination of the myth that they do indeed know how the mind works
1239593 for francesca psychotherapy was a mixed blessing it helps but not nearly as much as a few intense good friends she said i pay a therapist to listen to me and at the end of forty five minutes he says thats all the time we have well continue next week a friend on the other hand you can call any hour and say i need to talk to you theyre there and they really love you and want to help
1239594 good shrinks can probably deal with it the two i went to didnt help
1239595 were hooked on therapy when talking to a friend might do as well
1239596 young men with garden variety neuroses were assigned to one of two groups of therapists
1239597 patients undergoing psychotherapy with college professors showed quantitatively as much improvement as patients treated by experienced professional psychotherapists
1239598 the vanderbilt study mentioned earlier is far from the only one debunking the claims of professional superiority
1239599 the concept that a man who is trained in medicine or a ph d in psychology has a special insight into human nature is false
1239600 saying that psychotherapy does not work is like saying that prostitution does not work those enjoying the benefits of these personal transactions will continue doing so regardless of what the experts and researchers have to say
1239601 an educational rather than a psychodynamic or a medical model of psychotherapy
1239602 what is psychotherapy psychotherapy is simply a matter of reeducation reeducation implies letting go of the outmoded and learning the new and workable patients in one sense are like students they need the capacity and willingness to engage in the process of relearning
1239603 you might have all seen the photographs of cm b s yediyurappa the district incharge minister shobha karandlaje the mysore mp c h vijay shankar and the mayor of mysore ayub khan splashed all over the newspapers this morning the whole team met in bangalore to discuss how to make the dasara in mysore the grandest ever
1239604 why was the meeting not held in mysore when the topic was to discuss mysore dasara
1239605 lets not go in to trivia the point is in addition to the rs 10 crore earmarked earlier another rs 10 crore has been announced to the kitty perhaps this year dasara will be in a scale grander than the times when the maharajas were ruling the state
1239606 what about money for roads circles and fountains which no doubt have to be beautified every year
1239607 of course roads have to be asphalted footpaths have to be leveled and parks have to be spruced up all these cost money we hope he will announce more money for these projects which are as important as the dasara itself
1239608 doesnt the mysore city corporation allocate funds for roads footpaths and parks
1239609 yes they do but due to the summer heat and the monsoon rains most of these works have a shelf life of only six months dasara being an international event you need to have infrastructure of international quality which should last at least till next april when the mcc budget will be available again to take it up to international standards moreover so many foreigners will be coming
1239610 wonderful mysore is perhaps the only city in india which gets budget twice a year to improve the same set of roads parks footpaths to international standards this is fantastic is the cm releasing any more funds
1239611 you know the rains which played truant initially is back in full force all the dams are filling up fast rains particularly in mercara have been copious our cm has thanked the people of mercara for these rains and as a part of baagina is releasing rs 30 crore as a mark of gratitude
1239612 coorigs are so lucky i shudder to think of their fate had it not rained there
1239613 then he would have released the same amount as drought relief fund our cm is very kind
1239614 dasara is still two months away depending on his mood and situation he might release more and more if he finds our roads footpaths and parks are not up to mark he might also give more funds to mcc at the recommendation of the district minister more money could land in the dasara sub committees too if they find infrastructure is lacking somewhere please understand it is an all round effort we cannot even make a guess how much money will flow ultimately
1239615 isnt it wonderful so much more money will flow to mysore
1239616 by grace of god we will have all the dams overflowing by mahalaya amavase by the grace of our cm i hope funds too will be overflowing for dasara

1239623 mr manning informed chairmen conyers on july 17 2007 that his client intended to remain noncom pliant with the subpoena memorandum chairman conyers states
1239624 persons summoned as witnesses have certain minimum duties and obligations which as necessary concessions to the public interest in the orderly operation of legislative and judicial machinery we have often iterated the importance of this public duty which every person within the jurisdiction of the government is bound to perform when properly summoned
1239625 the court will refer to the defendants in this action and to the executive branch and the current administration generally as
1239626 written on eight previous occasions three of which letters contain or incorporate specific proposals involving terms for a possible agreement
1239627 is entitled to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on his official acts
1239628 would obviously threaten his independence and autonomy from congress in violation of separation of powers principles
1239629 those same principles apply just as clearly to the presidents closest advisers
1239630 have no operational authority over government agencies t heir sole function is to advise and assist the president in the exercise of his duties
1239631 w ere the presidents closest advisers subject to compelled testimony there would be no end to the demands that effectively could be placed upon the president himself
1239632 entitled to a blanket protection of absolute immunity as an incident of their offices as presidential aides
1239633 f or executive officials in general however our cases make plain that qualified immunity represents the norm
1239634 the importance to the president of loyal and efficient subordinates in executing his duties of office these factors alone are insufficient to justify absolute immunity

1239638 the courts must effectively intervene and nip the evil of perjury and false statements
1239639 where a tenant takes different stand in different courts to defeat the efforts of landlord to get the premises vacated at the time of need such an effort must be curbed by the courts effectively by binding him with his earlier statement in respect of the same premises and his plea of raising a dispute in respect of the rent admitted by him should not be heard and entertained
1239640 the courts and rent controller must keep in mind that the courts can not be converted into a wrestling field for trial of tricks where court has to act as umpire
1239641 if parties are allowed to approbate and reprobate at their sweet will and convenience and take the courts for a ride the whole judicial system shall fail the courts must effectively check such parties

1239645 yo estoy buscando a alguien el cual yo pueda respetar para poder ser sumisa yo debo respetarlo yo no puedo ser sumisa con un hombre que no pueda arreglar el mismo sus problemas yo no tengo ning n problema con el ser sumisa simplemente l tiene que merecerlo dios hizo a la mujer para ayudar al hombre yo no puedo ayudar a un hombre que no se puede ayudar a si mismo
1239646 if i cant be happy nobody deserves to be happy
1239647 though faith is above reason there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason since the same god who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind god cannot deny himself nor can truth ever contradict truth
1239648 consequently methodical research in all branches of knowledge provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws can never conflict with the faith because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same god the humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led as it were by the hand of god in spite of himself for it is god the conserver of all things who made them what they are
1239649 basic scientific research as well as applied research is a significant expression of mans dominion over creation science and technology are precious resources when placed at the service of man and promote his integral development for the benefit of all by themselves however they cannot disclose the meaning of existence and of human progress science and technology are ordered to man from whom they take their origin and development hence they find in the person and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and awareness of their limits
1239650 consider that in the history of religion or religious belief and science religion funded science
1239651 it wasnt until science started to disprove the bible that religion divorced science and started to damn it
1239652 so can someone belive in a god and still agree with science yes but they would have to believe that god intended to educate us though science which is what most of the believers i know think
1239653 most of the atheist mommies i know have an iq of 35
1239654 can someone believe in a god and still agree with science
1239655 of course this doesnt make it true its a far better way to view the world then to buy into creationism though mostly because according to scripture god knows all and is all and so this was all planned by god

1239657 the fifth way is taken from the governance of the world we see that things which lack intelligence such as natural bodies act for an end and this is evident from their acting always or nearly always in the same way so as to obtain the best result hence it is plain that not fortuitously but designedly do they achieve their end now whatever lacks intelligence cannot move towards an end unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer therefore some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end and this being we call god
1239658 come into the modern world and understand what the greatest minds do that there is no god and we are in control of our own destiny
1239659 there is no scientific method to prove the existence of god
1239660 he is nothing but an attempt of primitive man to explain the world before the advent of modern science
1239661 come into the modern world and understand what the greatest minds do that there is no god and we are in control of our own destiny
1239662 on the contrary it is liberating to think so and to live your life as it should be no need to be in the waiting room waiting to die to be in an imaginary heaven carpe diem

1239665 if christians had their way they would make it a crime not to believe in g od and i wouldnt be able to express my viewpoints
1239666 im sure that the people mentioned in the video have thought so much about a subject that it has turned them into imbeciles that just doesnt make sense at all
1239667 i think it is a way for you to off handly dismiss their opinions without seriously giving their opinions any thought at all that is one thing i know about religious people they will not even contemplate the other side for they are afraid of the truth
1239668 i am practicing science as that is my vocation i have personally met nobel prize winners and continuously helps scientists with their research each and everyday some of which will probably save your life someday so yes i practice science

1239796 the suggestion that waters are returning to more natural conditions may be of little consolation to water supply companies as they are faced with the increasingly difficult and expensive task of removing the colour from drinking water using treatment facilities that were designed to deal with the lower concentrations experienced in previous years
1239797 dont judge a brook by its colour brown waters are more natural
1239798 fortunately the united states and other developed countries have managed to rein in the biggest waterborne disease problems but water quality is still a very real concern sporadic illnesses and outbreaks still occur and they can have a serious impact on public health and commerce

1239825 the second quarter has been a transformational quarter for hecla we acquired the remainder of the greens creek joint venture and sold our venezuelan interests both transactions had one time impacts on the second quarter financial results as we completed the transition related to these two assets in the long term the greens creek acquisition and the venezuelan disposition provide our shareholders with 100 of the worlds lowest cost and fifth largest silver mine a substantially lower political risk profile and a 60 increase in 2008 annual silver production to 9 million ounces we have already seen a 60 increase in silver production for the second quarter compared to the same period a year ago
1239826 over the past 100 years hecla has materially changed itself before but this years transformation is unique hecla now controls 100 of the two largest silver mines in the u s that will produce more than 35 of all u s silver production and has large exploration programs in the historic southern colorado creede mining district the historic silver valley idaho and the world class mexican silver belt we expect our mines strong cash flow to continue to fund growth in production margins and resources weve added considerable mining and exploration expertise through our acquisition of the greens creek joint venture and weve retained some talented people from our venezuelan interests so we are even better positioned to add value to both internal and newly acquired assets
1239827 the second half of the year will see an increase in production as a result of the acquisition of the remaining 70 3 of the greens creek joint venture and improvements in the production profile over the remainder of 2008 with the opening of the northwest west longhole stopes in june second half 2008 silver production is expected to be more than double heclas share of the first six months production at greens creek variability in quarterly and even half yearly production happens periodically but will be more noticeable now that hecla owns 100 of the mine on the cost side we are impacted by increases that are affecting the whole industry but we can see dramatic containment of costs when we go to hydropower in the next few years
1239828 greens creeks underground exploration program is exciting because we expect it to continue to add to the resource base just as it has done over the past 20 years the surface program has defined new mine contact rocks to the northeast of the current workings this new area has the potential to host new ore zones which could result in a dramatic increase in resources in the future
1239829 these targets are what we expected when we combined more than 100 years of historical data with 3d computer exploration techniques its now possible that these new target areas could be incorporated into next years drilling program
1239830 it has been encouraging to receive widespread public support for this project in the creede area and the cooperation from the various regulatory agencies if the drilling is successful in this highly mineralized mining camp we could quickly add meaningful resources to our account
1239831 hecla has a history of carefully controlling dilution to shareholders i continue to believe that is an important factor in managing our business so we are considering all our options including deferral of capital expenditures to retire the bridge loan
1239832 our second quarter and year to date results were clearly impacted by the continuing adverse conditions in the global and domestic capital markets which have seen a continuing and unprecedented level of write offs and loan loss reserves by both domestic and international financial institutions as well as a continued weakening of the u s economy at the consumer level which is now starting to impact other parts of the economy
1239833 as we have said throughout this period of uncertainty and volatility we will continue to manage and grow through these unsettled market conditions we remain focused on our strategic business expansion plan to position the company for the future by taking advantage of our strong balance sheet our solid cash and liquidity position and our fully integrated capital markets services platform by adding high quality production personnel through both organic advancements and external recruitment
1239834 we would like to express our appreciation to our clients who continued to show their confidence in our ability to perform value added services for their commercial real estate and capital markets needs as evidenced by the nearly 12 billion in consummated transaction volume during the first six months in these very demanding and challenging times we would like to also thank each of our associates who have consistently demonstrated their ability to quickly adapt to this challenging environment by sharing their collective knowledge from each transaction with their fellow associates to provide superior value added services to our clients

1239836 accessmyhealth org is a great opportunity for washingtonians to learn about the benefits of having their health information online in a very secure manner and to inform us of what they would find worthwhile
1239837 the evergreen state is taking a leadership role to learn from the prospective users of online health records be they patients doctors or consumers that are ready to take charge of their own health
1239838 we encourage anyone in the state of washington to take our online surveys
1239839 weve got the questions and washingtonians have the answers the state legislature and the health care authority are providing strong vision and creating opportunities to test the promise of personalized online health records but to do it well we have to find out what privacy and security measures are important to washingtonians how will doctors and patients benefit from such access

1239846 the second quarter was a strong quarter for st mary year over year we grew production 15 from our retained properties commodity prices were very robust during the quarter which allowed us to generate strong cash flows for the year to date we have exceeded the production goals that we set out at the beginning of the year we are executing well on our business plan and our portfolio is improving every day i am pleased with how we are positioned as we enter the second half of the year
1239847 while patient volumes in the second quarter declined we believe the changes were due in part to short term issues that we have begun to address
1239848 and we minimized the impact upon earnings and cash flow through focused managerial discipline
1239849 i am particularly encouraged by the unambiguous progress we are making toward achieving our new vision to lead the industry in quality and satisfaction within two to three years we had a long way to go in a number of our markets when we launched the companys new direction on january 1 2008 but we have made sizable improvements to quality and patient satisfaction as we continue to improve in quality and patient satisfaction we expect to earn stronger patient and physician loyalty to our hospitals resulting in meaningful volume growth beginning within one to two years possibly sooner

1239884 the evora is the biggest milestone lotus has achieved since the elise was born 13 years ago and is part of our bold five year strategic plan which includes the introduction of new cars and technologies to many more markets around the world the evora also represents lotus core values of performance through light weight and efficiency and proves that you can have phenomenal performance fuel efficiency elegant design and practicality all in a class leading mid engine 2 2 sportscar which will meet global safety and homologation standards
1239885 looking to the future we will continue to research develop and produce lighter more efficient vehicles which are linked to our extensive and well regarded work on all aspects of future fuels alternative engines and electric and hybrid vehicle solutions for the future we all have an environmental responsibility to future generations and the evora is another example where lotus is seen to make significant steps towards improving the efficiency and sustainability of the motorcar keeping britain at the forefront of the high technology motor industry
1239886 a cornerstone of the designs success was working closely with the technical team to develop a package that allowed us to get the proportions correct
1239887 the asymmetric wheel sizes the short rear overhang long front overhang and cab forward visor screen all contribute to giving the car visual movement and an agile stance this is incredibly important to us because we want the cars aesthetics to communicate its driving characteristics
1239888 we never lost sight of the fact that although this car must provide real world useability sportscars are emotional purchases and that you have to seduce the customer through beguiling looks and exotic persona we are therefore very proud that we have been able to use technical and user functionality to positively drive the design in key areas and create some of the cars most distinctive features
1239889 we believe that our designs should be honest as well as dramatic and so we are really pleased with the fact that these iconic features all do a real job
1239890 overall the design language shows a clear dna link with its lotus siblings whilst establishing its own distinctive and contemporary theme the undulating shoulder line is brilliantly mirrored in the lower part of the bodyside by the cut away sill that creates a torseau like muscularity
1239891 your eye is drawn effortlessly from our signature mouth rearward by fluid surfaces and fast lines that create a sense of speed even when the car is stationary from this angle you can also see how dramatically the visor screen sweeps around the teardrop form of the cabin and the gently waisted plan shape perfectly accentuates the muscularity of the rear fender this is unmistakeably mid engined language and the evora is unmistakeably a lotus
1239892 a huge departure from what people might expect based on lotuss recent past we wanted the evoras cabin to feel special and to be surprising as well as sporty precision engineered metal inserts and quality edge lit switches are brilliantly juxtaposed against soft hand stitched leather surfaces to give a modern interior with a classic twist
1239893 the flat bottomed steering wheel figure hugging sports seat contemporary instrumentation and ergonomically positioned controls provide an intuitive environment that instantly forms a connection between driver and car ensuring that it becomes an extension of his or her body
1239894 tactile quality is incredibly important within this segment and so we wanted the interior to use honest premium materials much of the switchgear is bespoke and every metallic component is actually metal
1239895 this year lotus celebrates its 60th anniversary and it is fitting that 2008 is also the birth of the lotus evora a fantastic addition to the lotus range the lotus evora represents group lotus a company that is at the forefront of the automotive industry in a changing world where priorities of efficiency economy and environmental impact go hand in hand with performance design and individuality i think colin chapman would have approved
