140000 no other country as prosperous suffers such a high rate of suicide
140001 what we lost was confidence confidence in ourselves socially and economically
140002 we believed in the strength of the society and the power of our economy and we believed that things were getting better and better year by year and day by day thats a kind of confidence but that was lost once the cold war ended everything changed we couldnt adjust to the new situation it was a kind of chaos and we lost our sense of direction
140003 i can tell you its not coming in the july to september quarter
140004 the film is to america what the flag was once to britain by its means uncle sam may hope someday if he be not checked in time to americanise the world
140005 the british public talk america think america and dream america we have several million people who to all intent and purpose are temporary american citizens
140006 i think the time has come when the position of the film industry in this country should be examined with a view to seeing whether it be not possible as it is desirable on national grounds to see that the larger proportion of the films exhibited in this country are british having regard to the enormous power which the film is developing for propaganda purposes and the danger to which we in this country and our empire subject ourselves if we allow that method of propaganda to be entirely in the hands of foreign countries

140008 ik houd van de rockgroep queen gitarist brian may van queen is doctor in de astronomie zo raakte ik ge nteresseerd en gaf me op voor een cursus astronomie en voor een project van galaxy zoo
140009 op een gegeven moment zag ik iets dat ik niet thuis kon brengen daarom vroeg ik aan iemand van galaxy zoo wat dat eigenlijk voor een puntje was en galaxy zoo ging dat onderzoeken vervolgens bleek die nevel nog nooit eerder gezien te zijn
140010 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
140011 we wilden als team presteren en dat is goed gelukt
140012 als je het nuchter bekijkt hebben we het op twee terreinen goed gedaan
140013 we hadden 135 top acht posities meer dan in sydney dat geeft aan hoe de groep er in de breedte voor staat we wilden ook als team presteren en dat is goed gelukt er is geen enkel incident geweest terwijl alle mogelijkheden aanwezig waren om kleine dingen groot te laten worden
140014 olympische spelen ademen iets uit van sportiviteit en lol hebben in de sport dan gaat het niet primair om geld verdienen maar echt om sport
140015 als je zoiets meemaakt in een stadion met zoveel spanning en sfeer aan die sfeer merkte je of een sporter het goed deed of niet
140016 that really is an interesting idea and one that i think would work quite well
140017 it excelled by increasing its growth by nearly 100 in the consumer market
140018 due to a combination of weakened demand for the packard bell products and challenges with product transition as sales from inventory slowed down
140019 while the pc market is not immune from the economic forces sharp declines in average selling prices have certainly fostered the growth steeper than expected price cuts could hit pc makers profit margins and prolonged price pressure will force further consolidation amongst vendors
140020 has been a minor nuisance for years this year the spammers started winning and are taking over
140021 in the event a demand of such service tax is made on them they should give a written undertaking to the court that in the event the challenge is disallowed they shall make payment of service tax payable as per the amendment to the finance act in 2007
140022 on such undertaking being filed by the members of the petitioners no coercive steps shall be taken by the central government for recovery of service tax and the members shall not transfer its interest in the property without giving two weeks notice to the government

140024 between the 30 plus club and the defensive end situation and tight end situation i had to pull back on them we just didnt do the live periods we normally do in pads but we still got all the work done that needed to be done
140025 you talk to guys who come here from other teams and to guys you know around the league we do have a pretty hard camp
140026 ive heard from the veterans that this is one of the hardest camps in the nfl
140027 i think theres an adjustment period for new players in our system whether they are rookies or whether they are veteran guys we got through free agency
140028 its a little different here and in the end we all work toward making it a good environment for the player i think this is a tough tough thing that we do here
140029 you know im a defensive player so theres no such thing as too much hitting
140030 you dont want to hit your own guys all the time but i dont think its too much im a safety thats what i do
140031 i mean i dont want to cheap shot a guy like if theres a guy with his hands up im not going to try to decapitate him but at the same time thats how you get ready for the season the hitting
140032 it really doesnt matter to me i played for lou holtz in college
140033 some of my former teammates say they have better situations where they go
140034 of course some of those guys are on teams that arent very good look when you get in the games and youre not used to somebody hitting you more than likely youre going to fumble the football and stuff like that so you might as well get used to it
140035 at that point i couldnt really tell where my body was going
140036 i feel rejuvenated i feel like im ready to play football again
140037 it allowed those defensive ends that were here to work their way through the practice and play fast
140038 it was just something id push through and push through and after a while it kind of goes downhill
140039 he looked like he was moving around well i heard him talking a few times which is always a good sign because he wasnt talking a lot the other day
140040 you can see that he had a lot of interceptions in college and you always want to see if that carries over to the pro game
140041 in these practices you see him getting his hands on the ball and making catches
140042 that makes him a valuable guy if he can continue to improve in those areas
140043 asante is a little bit away but hes getting closer
140044 they get in and normally work out a little bit hit the tubs get a little extra sleep
140045 theyre not just lying around these guys are a little older now and this is helping them and ill keep it going
140046 i think when youre in the dryer kind of going around and around you dont worry about all that stuff thats not what we worry about here and i know there are issues im sure theyre saying if brett shows up brett shows up i think mike
140047 were normally stockpiled at defensive line and we wouldnt be in this type of situation but thats what it is right now and you move on with it
140048 if you have to make a little adjustment like we did this morning its no big deal we still got a lot taught and at the same time the guys will come out and put the pads back on today and be ready to go you even get a little bit more fire out of them than you would have if you banged them today
140049 i remember parts of practice and i remember sitting there getting water thrown on me
140050 once i got to the hospital i was fine it was one of those things where i couldnt tell what my body was doing
140051 the thing about it is your mind is just rambling everywhere you just feel like youre out of breath
140052 but then you really dont want to make anything worse youve got to be smart and let the trainers do their job if you do what they say eventually youll go back out there
140053 im looking real forward to being back in pads make some tackles make some plays
140054 youre dealing with a smart guy there that gives you a little flexibility with what you can do with hank
140055 hes playing very well right now and hes catching the ball real well were seeing him go up and the quarterbacks just put the ball up hes covered they put the ball up and he goes and gets the thing he can about jump out of the house hes got a great vertical jump and hes utilizing that better he looks to me stronger than what hes been in the past and hes got that big body to go with it hes playing very well right now
140056 definitely the sizewise big receiver but there was a lot of talk in the offseason outside the organization about that one go to guy
140057 any position you have that one key player things happen in this league all the time something happens to that one player then what
140058 id much rather have a team full of guys where if kevin curtis needs a blow or reggie brown needs a blow theyre confident that we can go in and make plays
140059 last year i wasnt going up and attacking the ball like i was the year before thats one thing ive tried to come back and do coach reid got on me a couple of times in the offseason about not going up and getting the ball thats what ive been focusing on this camp
140060 like he told me today there was a catch in the red zone hes like thats what you do you use your body
140061 this year ive lost the weight i feel quicker i feel healthier ive just been focusing on the few little things i sort of overlooked last year in camp
140062 we werent very good in the red zone last season
140063 we were very good in many other factors of the game but that red zone was not good that starts with me we always change if somethings wrong were going to fix it and we did that throughout the season and thought we had it clicking there about midseason and then we reverted back and so yes weve done many things there to improve our red zone production
140064 hes a big physical man who does quite a few different things for us and that certainly is one of them
140065 still a little bit away but hes getting closer here
140066 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
140067 if philadelphia really understood his value to that team they would never even have allowed him to get upset with his contract you take westbrook off that team and nobody would fear them i dont think they truly understand that
140068 youve got to game plan against him youve got to know where he is every play as a defensive end the things that we do change when hes in the football game when youve got a player on your team like that you have to take care of him
140069 he should be one of the highest paid players in the league period im not saying this as a friend of his i dont even know the guy that well im just saying it because its the truth
140070 tiki couldve played a couple more years at a high level i think
140071 its a young mans game though i do know that
140072 i was hoping to get 3 years out of him we ended up getting 5 he kept himself in excellent shape in his entire 15 year career he had just one minor arthroscopy to his knee
140073 he knew when to get down and avoid the big hit he had terrific peripheral vision former raiders coach art shell used to call him horse eyes he could anticipate the hit coming
140074 guys come at him from all angles but hes very good at avoiding the harsh hits
140075 thats because hes smart about the way he runs and because he has great vision also because hes short in stature hes 5 8 he has great body lean and body awareness its really hard for a tackler to get under him
140076 i dont know who you could compare him to in that respect maybe walter payton he never took a lot of big hits either
140077 brian does it almost by going sideways past tacklers he is without question the best athlete ive ever coached its so hard to describe his athleticism but when you see it you know it wow maybe thats the word wow
140078 you always wonder when a guy is going to hit the wall
140079 with older players youre always rolling the dice you always want to try to reward the guys that have been good players good soldiers for you
140080 sometimes guys slowly decline and sometimes its just a free fall you look at the stats to help you but the stats will lie to you sometimes
140081 there are guys that have done it been productive after theyve turned 30
140082 can they continue to do it thats the question im hoping i can
140083 this is your period this is not a jog through
140084 were concentrating on turnovers so lets get turnovers i care about the ball in the air
140085 got into online racing about a year and a half ago and actually thats how i met him
140086 he goes three wide at talladega at 300 miles an hour
140087 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
140088 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
140089 es ist klasse den kalender f r n chstes jahr schon so fr h zu kennen wir mussten in diese saison mit ganz wenig vorbereitungszeit gehen und das wird uns dabei helfen 2009 besser vorbereitet zu sein in long beach edmonton und toronto ist f r uns sehr gut und ich w rde mich auch sehr freuen wenn wir 2009 wieder nach surfers paradise fahren w rden
140090 es ist toll dass wir mit long beach und toronto wieder zwei orte besuchen an denen der formelsport eine tradition besitzt interessant ist auch dass nun homestead und japan so sp t im kalender sind hoffentlich ist das wetter in japan im september besser cih freue mich darauf
140091 obwohl ich gerne noch mehr rundkurse im kalender sehen w rde ist es insofern gut als dass wir auf so ziemlich alle strecken zur ckkehren werden auf denen wir nun schon erfahrungen gesammelt haben so besitzen wir wenigstens jeweils einen ansatzpunkt toronto ist auch gut denn das war immer ein erfolgreiches event
140092 2009 wird wieder ein herausragender mix de rim motorsport seinesgleichen sucht rundkurse kleine ovale gro e speedways und stra enkurse das ist einer der st rksten kalender die die indycar serie jemals zusammengestellt hat wir unterst tzen sie zu 100 prozent um auch weiterhin f r sponsoren teams und fahrer attraktiv zu sein
140093 das auto verbessert sich und ich mag diese strecke es ist nicht die beste strecke aber ich war hier in der vergangenheit gut
140094 es wird nach wie vor f r mich schwierig es wird f r mich weiterhin eine herausforderung sein mein ergebnis wird sich nicht dadurch ndern nur weil ich in hockenheim auf dem podium stand
140095 irgendwo zwischen den pl tzen f nf und acht w re schon gut auf das podium zu kommen w re exzellent
140096 in magny cours waren wir schneller aber hatten zum beispiel im vergleich zu mclaren nur halb so viel fl gel das ist ein hinweis darauf dass unser motor wom glich etwas weniger leistung hat als jener von mclaren aber da das reglement eingefroren ist wollen wir nicht schummeln
140097 sebastian du hast den gro teil des trainings von der box aus anschauen m ssen was ist passiert
140098 nicht viel ich hatte relativ fr h feierabend ich habe nur eine runde geschafft dann hatten wir leider ein problem mit der hydraulik ich hatte keinen hydraulikdruck mehr aber davon h ngt im prinzip alles im auto ab ich konnte die g nge nicht mehr hoch und runterschalten musste das auto abstellen das ist immer schade aber f r die zweite session heute nachmittag m ssten wir es wieder hinkriegen
140099 du konntest nur vier runden fahren fast alle anderen haben mehr als 20 runden wie sehr fehlt diese zeit
140100 es ist kein vorteil aber der nachteil ist gering denn die strecke hier braucht sehr lange bis die fahrzeuge einigerma en schnell sind zum ende der session war sie dann doch um einiges besser aber gerade am anfang hat man gesehen wie lange alle gewartet haben bevor sie rausgegangen sind so gesehen habe ich nur eine knappe halbe stunde verloren das sollte nicht so tragisch sein
140101 der hungaroring ist sehr speziell ein micky maus kurs wie viele sagen wie liegt er dir
140102 mir macht die strecke spa beim ersten rausfahren merkt man immer erst wie eng sie ist und wie wenig geraden es hat wenn man von kurve zu kurve f hrt es ist wirklich ein bisschen wie eine kartbahn aber es macht sehr viel spa es gibt einige bodenwellen und es ist mit sicherheit keine einfache strecke
140103 was ist f r toro rosso und dich an diesem wochenende drin
140104 we do not encourage that the armed forces should be used as an extension of para military forces to deal with law and order problems
140105 we feel states are best equipped to deal with ordinary law and order problems and if they are not they always have the option of calling in the para military forces
140106 calling in of armed forces should be in extraordinary situations
140107 can there be any greater shame for the prime minister and the congress leadership but the worrying thing is that there is no sense of remorse or guilt at these immoral and shady practices such is the degeneration of the congress party in its lust to remain in office
140108 even before the trust vote the indications of the shape of things to come were revealed amar singh the samajwadi party leader demanded that the prime minister mediates between the two warring ambani brothers
140109 i have consciously taken the principled decision to uphold the constitution of india at the risk of being unjustifiably dubbed as anti party
140110 fulfil my obligations and responsibilities as the speaker during my tenure
140111 liverpool was pressuring him to not come here but he said i want to go
140112 his condition was very critical for the last four days
140113 he was in the intensive care unit of our hospital on life support systems his condition was slowly deteriorating and he passed away a little after 1 30 p m
140114 i personally watched hours of late night infomericals looking for the perfect partner for mlss web properties
140115 everyone knows gold is the gold standard of precious metals
140116 mls is the number one soccer league in the u s and cashforgoldusa com is americas number one refiner of gold its a perfect match of elite brands
140117 oh i plan on digging through my mothers dresser tonight
140118 shes got all this stuff she never wears thats cash money right there baby i will be able to eat in august
140119 you know i got some stuff that reminds me too much of my wild days gonna ship it off and buy my baby girl something nice like a really great gold necklace
140120 who hasnt been a little short when going to buy your fifth 10 stadium beer of the night
140121 selling some of your wifes of girlfriends gold for cash is the perfect solution
140122 bought over intimidated or blackmailed into either voting for the government or to abstain
140123 such is the degeneration of the congress party in its lust to remain in office
140124 tainted by the use of money power on a scale never seen before in the corridors of power in new delhi
140125 a berth in the union cabinet threats of unleashing investigating agencies against unwilling opposition mps and bribes running into crores of rupees have enabled to survive
140126 the cabinet after all showed the will readiness and specific plans to get out of the current situation
140127 we knew with mark viduka that hed miss the start of the season so that leaves us with two and both are going to catch up
140128 its not like were not going to have them for the start of the season theyll both be available for me if i want to pick them for the home game against psv eindhoven hopefully and certainly valencia a few weeks before the season starts
140129 hes had an injection in his knee which he needed
140130 we were actually going to do it before his mother died tragically he had to go the next day so it just delayed the process
140131 hell be able to run today and kick a ball properly by about saturday but hes missed ten days training so theres no sense risking him much as youd like to play him
140132 weve had a few little niggles like everybody else at this time of year blisters and slight little strains
140133 weve had to pull a few away for a few days usually just as a precaution and not anything too worrying but with a view that it would be crazy to lose players for a long period at this time of year its a balancing act
140134 weve got some young kids here who wouldnt normally be with us but weve still got a very good squad
140135 if they do well and you know youve got other players to come back the likes of mark viduka michael owen and obafemi martins plus two or three others who weve left behind then you want the team to do well so when the others come back in they can take it on again thats the ideal thing
140136 if this doesnt shock that fat greedy bastard in to action then nothing will god i h8 him
140137 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
140138 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at
140139 weblogging is the glue that brings all the experts together within the company
140140 he is not going to be a junior officer he will be there in a visiting role to observe
140141 modern day love story jam packed with humour hurt hope and happiness
140142 these kids are absolutely normal even though their parents are suffering from leprosy but yet they have been condemned from the facilities of society even though having provision of government reservation for them they dont get work we thought of establishing them in the society through education with a one point programme of sending their children away from this atmosphere to study
140143 i am going to haridwar to study and become a doctor when i grow up
140144 i never studied here but i want to stay in haridwar and study so that even i can be successful one day
140145 at one point it was assembled in a completely different order
140146 its flattering when theyre on tv talking about you being vp
140147 weve got to create a new louisiana so that our sons and daughters can grow up here
140148 being endorsed by the blue dog coalition means a lot to the people of my district
140149 ich habe einen sehr leichten und transparenten look mit vielen unterschiedlichen arten von spitze kreiert auf den ersten blick wirkt meine kreation eher schlicht aber wenn man genauer hinschaut werden details sichtbar
140150 it only takes one idiot to lash out and someone could be seriously injured
140151 some people get really aggressive after a few drinks lecturing them and handing out sticks will just make things worse
140152 in a letter to employees american airlines ceo gerard arpey said while many would expect the airline to raise prices to offset fuel expenses he believes such an initiative would prompt passengers to seek out competitors fares or avoid flying altogether
140153 you very well could see some new platforms some new vehicles out next year
140154 i was sold on the ambition of london welsh and the fact that the club was moving into a professional era going from part time to full time
140155 we have said that it will be coming out this year i can tell you its not coming in the july to september quarter
140156 on our answering machine and poor brigitte even called despite the fact that she could hardly talk with her sore throat so sweet you guys

140159 we have a health care crisis we dont have an entitlement crisis
140160 let this serve as yet another wake up call to our government leaders in washington d c the states and territories we cannot turn our backs on the hiv aids epidemic in our own country hiv aids is devastating many communities particularly gay men african americans latinos and injection drug users the aids institute calls upon president bush the congress together with both presidential candidates to support a national aids strategy and to demonstrate their leadership by committing immediately to preventing hiv in the united states through increased funding for the cdc hiv prevention programs and the establishment and implementation of prevention policies and programs based on sound scientific evidence for next year president bush has proposed to cut the cdc hiv prevention budget by 1 million this is on top of this years budget cut of 3 5 million neither the u s house of representatives nor the u s senate has proposed any increased funding for hiv prevention this is completely unacceptable particularly in light of the new incidence numbers congress must increase funding for hiv prevention for next year by at least 30 million this is far from what is needed but it is at least a necessary first step the aids institute calls on the administration congress and the presidential candidates to support policies and programs that are scientifically known to prevent hiv prevention such as comprehensive sex education hiv testing and counseling and syringe exchange further we call upon our leaders to commit the resources necessary at the national institutes of health to conduct behavioral research and to continue to develop such biomedical prevention approaches as microbicides and a vaccine the government also needs to end programs and policies that are proven not to work such as abstinence only until marriage programs with the revelation that there are more people being infected with hiv in the u s each year means more people will be identified as living with hiv aids it also means they will need adequate healthcare and lifesaving medications to keep them healthy again we must turn to our government to make sure the necessary resources are there for them the united states has made a remarkable and much needed commitment to global aids through the recent reauthorization and expansion of the presidents emergency plan for aids relief pepfar this demonstrated profound leadership on the part of our government addressing the hiv aids epidemic at home in our own country requires the same leadership action and resolve by our leaders and those aspiring to become our leaders the clock is running out there is no better time than right now to end aids in america
140161 we have made a concerted effort to make the registration process as straightforward as possible for everyone and to ensure a smooth transition
140162 registration brings with it new responsibilities and the gdc will be doing all it can to ensure registrants are kept fully up to date with the latest information news and requirements through our website and the gdc gazette
140163 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism
140164 this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
140165 if this peptide can be developed into a treatment for children with this common form of hi we may have a new tool for controlling their insulin levels and managing their disease
140166 by funding such outstanding research projects we hope to accelerate the development of successful lymphoma treatments
140167 on behalf of the foundation it is my pleasure to welcome these young scientists to the lrf family
140168 each year 300 000 cancer patients in the united states are treated with a platinum based chemotherapy and most relapse after initial treatment
140169 therefore intrinsic or acquired resistance to platinums is a significant treatment issue picoplatin our lead product candidate was designed to overcome platinum resistance and we are exploring the use of genetic markers of platinum resistance to optimize patient treatment
140170 while coal tar is widely viewed as a very effective treatment for psoriasis its historically unappealing aesthetic profile has created problems with patient compliance and reduced overall treatment satisfaction
140171 these findings demonstrate the non prescription lcd treatment is at least as effective as a leading prescription medication further they suggest the aesthetically pleasing formulation of the lcd treatment offers a much needed alternative for safe effective easy to use topical drug therapy for mild to moderate psoriasis a welcome tool in our armamentarium
140172 we developed psorent to answer patient needs for a non prescription topical psoriasis therapy that offers a different experience from traditional coal tar treatment a formula with similar or better efficacy to a leading prescription medication that was quick drying had an acceptable scent and was easy to apply
140173 the excellent patient satisfaction revealed in this study validates our success in creating this new generation topical psoriasis therapy that offers clinical efficacy in an aesthetically pleasing non prescription formulation
140174 so weve gone from maybe one fifth or one sixth of the worlds population participating to where we now have a huge pool of people in the olympic games
140175 at some level weve reached a physiological plateau in general the champions of today dont have dramatically better treadmill times as compared to elite athletes of earlier generations what i think we are seeing is a small effect due to better racetracks shoes and improved sports medicine and people are participating longer so you have more competitive depth which leads to better races and races designed to set world records
140176 the lactate threshold is highly related to how people perform in an event like the 10 000 meter race marathons or a bicycle time trial the physiology and biochemistry behind it is complex and controversial but its a good marker of when the regulatory and physiological control systems of the body are in balance
140177 the first misperception is that somehow people dont have enough oxygen when they are making lactic acid that certainly can be true because lactic acid can come from a lack of oxygen but under most circumstances the athletes have plenty of oxygen and there is plenty of oxygen in the muscle
140178 the second misnomer is that lactic acid hangs around in your muscle for long periods of time you may hear things like this individual is sore or not performing as well today because they have a lot of lactic acid in their muscle from yesterdays event well you can have very high levels of lactic acid in muscle but its gone 15 to 30 minutes after exercise so lactic acid doesnt hang around a long time
140179 breathing oxygen on the sidelines really doesnt help theres no evidence that it works
140180 they all have big engines and high lactate thresholds because theyve been training hard for a long time their muscles have adapted to run very fast without releasing a lot of lactic acid
140181 in cycling for example when lance armstrong came back from cancer he became much more efficient he could generate more power per given oxygen update that is the same as a runner being able to generate more speed per given power when you look at this small pool of elite athletes of runners cyclists and rowers all of them have a high vo2 all have a large engine and all of them have skeletal muscles that are designed not to produce a lot of lactic acid so the question then becomes who is the most efficient
140182 your vo2 max typically starts to decline in your 30s but a highly trained athlete can delay that decline until they are in their later 30s or even early 40s an average sedentary person loses about 10 percent per decade starting at about age 30 but for someone who is able to continue to train very hard into their 40s and 50s they only lose about half that much primarily due to the fact they continue to train hard
140183 as scientists search for genes and the determinants of performance they keep drawing a blank there have been no major gene discoveries saying that this gene really confers championship status or the potential for championship status of one person
140184 it can be very deceptive to say that since the kenyans and perhaps ethiopians are dominating distance running it must be genetic in fact there have been periods of time when other cultures have dominated distance running before world war ii the finns dominated distance running after world war ii the eastern europeans dominated distance running they were just as dominant as the kenyans are now
140185 i think what the kenyans and ethiopians have shown is the value of altitude training they are physically active their entire lives they live at high altitude they run to and from school they play soccer after school all at high altitude 6 000 to 8 000 feet there are not a lot of economic opportunities so there is a tremendous incentive for people to run and train hard
140186 so what the kenyans have added is altitude training hard training and large numbers of highly motivated people but their physiological data is not dramatically different from other people i think you can make the same argument for the eastern europeans after world war ii if you were a pretty good athlete the government offered you and your family incentives to train in an otherwise bleak economic landscape
140187 one of the sad things in last 30 to 40 years of sport has been the emergence of the pharmacological arms race or doping
140188 researchers have started to test the tests and have raised questions about the accuracy of the existing tests theyve shown that if you dont do the test soon after people take the drug it may be very difficult to detect especially if epo is take in low doses
140189 remember while its fun to watch sports and while we will all be tempted to sit in front of the tv to watch the olympics the really important thing is to get out and move one hundred and fifty minutes of physical activity a week is really the most powerful medicine anybody can prescribe no matter what your level of fitness even if its just walking try to be as physically active as you possibly can because thats the way to be a healthy old person and get more out of life
140190 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
140191 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
140192 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
140193 dr richmond was truly a visionary he worked tirelessly for the causes in which he believed and was instrumental in guiding the field of public health to where it is today

140195 our findings suggest that anti pc can be used as a complement to the traditional risk factors to improve diagnosis and treatment in addition we are currently developing anti pc as a vaccine for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease

140198 the trust has acknowledged that mistakes were made and their senior management team has changed substantially our priority now is to provide reassurance to the people of kent that the infection risk at their hospitals is being properly managed an audit of the trust will therefore be conducted this september
140199 the results strongly support the notion that schizophrenia may be partly caused by the effects of such structural changes in genes both across the whole genome and in specific chromosomes
140200 we anticipate a breakthrough in the near future in research into psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia bipolar disease and autism at the same i wish to stress that in such a complex disease as schizophrenia there is a need for research on both genetic and environmental causes and on treatment and management
140201 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
140202 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
140203 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
140204 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options
140205 its the first study ive done in this field and the results are astounding they indicate a very strong correlation between this type of social factor and the risk of developing dementia
140206 this suggests two influencing factors social and intellectual stimulation and trauma
140207 in practice it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis if our interpretation will hold such an intervention strategy could also be profitable for society considering the costs for dementia care
140208 does it matter for instance if the relationship is a happy one or not and does it matter if someone has always intended to live a single life or not
140209 this research provides a better characterization of the variables at the cellular circuit and behavioral level that contribute to the persistent nature of addictive disorders
140210 the researchers were able to illuminate why drug related memories are so stable
140211 their persistence is highly refractory to new learning which makes our jobs that much tougher and reminds us that treatment must recognize and address the high propensity for relapse almost anywhere down the road
140212 these results indicate that the ltp induced by self administered cocaine is more persistent than that produced by natural rewards such as food and that the ltp is not just a result of exposure to cocaine but also is linked to the drugs effects and the animals learning to obtain the drug
140213 these are important distinctions that will help us better understand how addiction develops and why drugs can overshadow other natural rewards and become the mainstay of an addicted persons life
140214 we are very disappointed that the department of health has sought to challenge the decision of the high court effectively the department is saying that a primary care trust should be able to say to a dentist your contract will come to an end tomorrow just because we feel like it
140215 every right minded person can see that this is totally unreasonable and would destroy the viability of family dental practices how can dentists plan for the future if they have no security a success for the department of health would be bad for dentists bad for patients and disastrous for the health of the nation we will continue to fight on behalf of dr crouch and the profession against this ridiculous clause

140274 these are simple changes that will make a big difference to patients at the end of their lives
140275 historically doctors have been encouraged to back away from patients when they enter hospice but this keeps familiar people involved
140276 plus its nice to have someone there who is not concerned with the hospices bottom line
140277 people are living longer and the end of life looks different than it used to
140278 the federal government wants to know what theyre paying for and everyone understands that
140279 good organizations are already doing most of these things so the effects on us will be minimal
140280 the new rules really should allow the hospices to meet the individual needs of each patient
140281 it usually will fall to the states and the individual doesnt have any way to enforce these rights
140282 will have to be very diligent about keeping up with what is going on
140283 our job is not to add stress at the end of life but to make it easy
140284 the committee has faced roadblock after roadblock in its search for a good senior center
140285 the potential advantages for proton therapy are so enormous that we think this is not only worth doing but we need to do it
140286 proton therapy is the radiation therapy of the 21st century
140287 men dont want to see that part of their body damaged so its used widely for prostate
140288 im excited about the possibility of a joint venture to bring proton therapy to south florida
140289 ive always had mixed feelings about protons and the way theyre being used right now we need more academic centers on board to drive the research and to establish what the role of proton is
140290 if you semiretire at age 62 and if youre taking social security benefits that is money you dont have to pull from retirement assets
140291 you will want to choose a retirement age based on your circumstances so you will have sufficient income when you need it
140292 if you are really strapped for money this is not a good idea
140293 the fact most people dont know about this rule is why people talk about a break even point should i take it early or should i wait
140294 but if you have the ability to take advantage of the rule you can have your cake and eat it too
140295 it opens the door for people to go confidently into generating reprogrammed stem cells for other disease models
140296 were on the threshold of a new era of technology where we might have some definitive strategies to better treat or cure diseases like als or other neurodegenerative diseases
140297 its possible to use these cells to make the actual cell type that is destroyed in that persons disease
140298 it takes the study of disease out of the patient where its very difficult and into the petri dish
140299 for the moment that would preclude the use of these exact cells in these patients
140300 these patient specific stem cells will be useful for pathological studies and potentially also for drug screening
140301 using these cells we can test chemical compounds for their ability to prevent neuron degeneration
140302 it essentially proves that reprogrammed stem cells can be derived from diseased human skin cells as well
140303 the hard work now is to establish whether the als reprogrammed cells are any different from those taken from normal patients
140304 the enunciation of a monosyllabic barnyard epithet is stretched hilariously over several minutes of music

140316 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
140317 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation

140393 and it looks like ken chenault has been swimming naked
140394 weve had the best sales month for 12 months and i have spoken to colleagues who sell properties on the coast in north wales and there are similar anecdotes around the country
140395 people are still keen to get their hands on individual properties in rural locations these are houses of character which people wish to buy some are holiday homes but not all it is a tough market out there but it is clear there are pockets of the uk where sales are holding up and are strong
140396 i think a number of people with second homes are selling up because they are not seeing a capital growth and the rental income is sporadic therefore if there is no return on investment people cannot justify having the property i think the people keeping the market going are those who like a particular area and want to buy in or people moving for business reasons
140397 people are taking advantage of lower prices in the market some are going to retire in three or five years time and want to buy their new home now there is also a trend for holidays in the uk and some think they may as well snap up a property in a place they already know and love to visit

140493 sean was loved by his nana brother sister and i and he was close to all of us
140494 we are all distraught at what has happened and i want the people responsible to be caught so that i can lay my son to rest in peace

140500 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
140501 we should also protect the player and if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
140502 because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club im always in favour to protect the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave

140511 we thought it was a good deal we were ready to accept the deal
140512 i confirm our ambition to be a major actor of the nuclear rebirth in britain we have been working on that for three years and we have taken measures to reach this target
140513 the conditions notably financial ones allowing a major development of edf in britain are not there

140516 we have all worked extremely hard to meet our commitment to commence production of the mg tf in august
140517 we are delighted to have reached this important point and are looking forward to seeing the cars in showrooms shortly
140518 we have taken the very best options from the car that you saw before and put them into one package
140519 if you look at the pre orders that we have had through our dealers about 70 percent are already sold and that tells its own story
140520 the launch of this car also marks the re introduction of the mg brand to the uk

140524 as the tide comes in it lifts the whole contraption up which gives us control of the whale
140525 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to
140526 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
140527 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
140528 but the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular deal
140529 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged but i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations

140618 it is critically important for linux to have an easy way for software developers to write to distro n whether its red hat ubuntu or novell
140619 the future of linux that i would love to see is upstream projects adopting our tests
140620 look at a project like ruby and they have a model that when you write code you submit a test along with it it makes the project high quality because of the rigorous tests
140621 the thing that i want to see from the lsb and the linux developer network is a set of dead simple tools so that isvs can take advantage of the standardization work weve done
140622 the standard is not punitive and no one will go to jail if they dont comply with the lsb
140623 there will be application vendors that will want to certify to lsb 4 as there will be broad enough coverage in the specification for them to build multidistribution applications
140624 our tools are a quantum leap ahead of where we used to be
140625 the bar for costs of certifying to linux foundation lsb is largely a development issue
140626 when you certify to a red hat novell or ubuntu the bar is by and large a channel partnership and a support infrastructure which is a higher cost than the development component

140745 ik heb zoveel kinderen geobserveerd vooral emigrantenkinderen die geen vaderland en bijgevolg geen moedertaal meer hadden en die reeds met 5 6 jaar meerdere talen vlot spraken welnu ik vond steeds dat daarmee een zekere vervlakking van de idee n gepaard ging doordat hen het fijne gevoel ontbrak voor de fijne schaderkingen van het begrip dat zich immers in iedere taal overeenkomstig het nationale karakter modificeert terwijl het in latere jaren een waar genot voor de geest is met het binnendringen in een vreemde taal plotseling de sluiter te zien vallen waardoor ons de individuele zienswijze van een vreemd volk duidelijk wordt en die van ons daardoor omgevormd dan wel bevestigd wordt

140824 theres no one in this house thats more thick skinned than i am in terms of playing politics but playing with someones reputation especially someone that has felt so honored to serve in this house i really think goes a step beyond that
140825 it violated my sense of decency thats all im saying
140826 this bill is well intended but it appears on the surface to be this is as polite as i can be about it somewhat more comprehensive and beneficial than it really needs to be to solve the immediate problem
140827 some hidden costs that dont necessarily need to be borne by the federal taxpayer

140832 he got a significant sum of money for him to live comfortably for the rest of his life
140833 he is not a rockefeller he has zero money she was his enabler
140834 he said she told him if you give me a million dollars you can have custody of your daughter
140835 because he needed the money to buy his daughter from his wife
140836 he was mr mom and he seemed pissed that his wife was the breadwinner and she was always away
140837 shes a very smart little girl but he pushes her too much
140838 he didnt have to do anything for living because he had money
140839 she has fielded all the calls of crisis in clarks life
140840 i worked for acs i agreed with other people to embezzle money
140841 were going to have a beautiful success in this were just tired of these blacks and latinos we need to cut it down theres too many n and hispanic babies and children
140842 i have some disciples at gerber and they are very loyal to me they stick to their word when they say theyre going to do something
140843 we are aware of a recent posting on the internet and believe this is a malicious hoax the safety of gerber and nestl nutrition products is our top priority we are taking this issue seriously and are cooperating fully with federal authorities
140844 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
140845 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
140846 these kids just need someone to care for them and show them a way

140848 these findings reinforce the fact that women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy
140849 prenatal exposure to alcohol especially excessive amounts at one time can adversely affect the foetus and may increase the risk of infant clefts
140850 the greater the blood alcohol concentration the longer the foetus is exposed a single binge during a critical period of an infants development can be harmful

140853 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
140854 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
140855 at an average cost of 7 699 pounds per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million pounds annually
140856 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs she added
140857 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
140858 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care

140875 the bridge collapse remains to me a symbol of a state and nation that hasnt paid sufficient attention to its infrastructure
140876 the new bridge shows what we can do when we focus our attention and resources now lets move on to the rest of the system
140877 the anniversary of the bridge collapse is this friday and the convention isnt for a month after that the two things arent really related
140878 a tragedy of that kind raises national visibility to those kinds of decisions
140879 they are based on a bunch of different factors and the weight nominees give to them
140880 i would certainly hope that while members are in minnesota they would visit the new bridge and reflect on the countrys need for infrastructure funding
140881 everyone is very careful about not making the i 35 bridge an issue
140882 gov rendell and mayor bloomberg wanted to highlight the infrastructure issue but didnt do it in a way to involve the bridge both were sensitive that people died there
140883 it takes away flexibility from the states to spend the money where its most needed

140925 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to
140926 it has been in the area for a couple of days which is not good it means it will be already dehydrated and very very hungry
140927 it wont have eaten for a couple of days because theres no squid and it feeds on squid in the deep water
140928 it may have come off course because it is sick or it may just have got disorientated we dont know why these things happen
140929 the trouble is the minute they get out of the water because of the weight of the body it starts to compress all its organs so you then get a build up of toxins

140935 the feeling is sometimes a little bit of frustration when you see you do a perfect race and you finish sixth or seventh and there is nothing more that you can do if you do a perfect lap in qualifying maybe you are fifth

140985 today with global communications with the integration of the global economy with the ability of actors to operate at long distances
140986 its possible that failed states at great distances from the united states and of course closer can represent a national security danger
140987 over the past 20 years over the course of 17 significant stabilization and reconstruction missions in which the united states has been involved too much of the effort has been borne by our men and women in uniform
140988 the capability that we are trying to create will be made up of serious professionals who have the type of skills that the governments need

140994 i have grave concern with the image of the united states as bad as it is around the world at this point that putting u s personnel on the ground will generate this kind of nationalist response against the united states and then imperil the people who weve deployed there
140995 what will be the political outcry in washington if you have u s personnel from the state department being killed
140996 i think the impulse would be to send in even greater numbers of u s military to sort of remedy the outcome
140997 there will be an element of risk and people cannot be assured if they are deployed for some of our operations that theyre going into a place where absolute safety is guaranteed
140998 there have been dozens and dozens and dozens of failed states that have existed throughout the world over the past 15 or 20 years and yet we have one data point to revert back to afghanistan in which there was actually a pressing threat to u s national security that happened to emerge from a failed state
140999 anyone who looked at pictures of the twin towers on september 11 cannot say that failed states are not an issue
141000 the point is that not all failed states represent a security challenge to the united states but some do

141067 the first stars were very different from stars like the sun
141068 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
141069 we do see stars in our galaxy that have very different properties than our sun and its possible these are second generation stars
141070 abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe
141071 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point toward our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
141072 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star
141073 tried to call you but my cell phone blah blah blah
141074 sure if you want one and you do the footwork
141075 i know august 11 na very exciting for me and i guess for everyone kasi wed been working really hard but at the same time im nervous
141076 ayon makukulit lahat sila makukulit but its been so much fun working with them
141077 okay siya its so much fun working with him again ang last namin kasi iyong ang cute ng ina mo so to work with him iyon naalala ko lahat iyong dictation sa tagalog so iyon narrates the actress
141078 hindi naman sa nahihirapan but it has a lot of work and its thrice a week na iyong tipong para matulog gigising nang hapon na tapos tulog ulit tapos diretso na sa set so its a lot of work hindi ko nga alam na pumayat na ako hindi ko na notice but its a good thing for me she said
141079 just doing nothing together wala lang iyong you are just happy enough just being in each others company iyong nagkukuwentuhan or mahilig kami sa movies
141080 of course i wouldnt been dating him if not hindi ba if he keeps how he is
141081 kahit sam milby na siya hindi napunta sa ulo niya siya pa din yung naiilang thats what i like about him iba ang kabaitan nya i know na maraming mag aagree with me
141082 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
141083 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
141084 you have value on the ground more than you spent
141085 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
141086 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
141087 when she made it clear she didnt want to have anything to do with him he became enraged
141088 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint
141089 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
141090 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
141091 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
141092 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
141093 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
141094 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
141095 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
141096 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
141097 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
141098 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
141099 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
141100 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
141101 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
141102 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
141103 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
141104 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
141105 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
141106 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
141107 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
141108 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
141109 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
141110 theyve got lots of these little studio spaces for artists
141111 it feels great durham has started doing more with the arts and its wonderful
141112 artspace was big at one point but it was a very different feel you pretty much had to be established
141113 if one artist has an open house in golden belt its good for everybody
141114 the more people you get together the more its a catalyst to do interesting work
141115 every time i came here i thought this place is so beautiful durham is still locally cool and funky
141116 it was like moving into a dormitory on your first day of college and meeting all the other people on your floor
141117 the people who live around here are very interested in the project and i think they must be glad for something that anchors their neighborhood gives it some forward thrust
141118 if i had to bet money on it theres about a 98 chance we will be here
141119 this library draws more people to downtown durham than the durham bulls do this lbrary is shabby and pathetic and embarrassing to this community and it still draws that many people
141120 we cannot be penny wise and pound foolish on this library
141121 i know that the county commissioners have a certain amount for this library
141122 i stay up at night worrying if this is enough money
141123 well define whats really ideal for this project put square feet to it and cost it out
141124 get out and vote take your neighbors with you we desperately need that money
141125 we are huge fans of the library and believe that it is already in the center of downtown durham
141126 we would love to see the downtown loop redirected improving the access to the area for pedestrians
141127 so much noise i guess the people from the shelter come over here and they carry on a conversation and you just cannot do any work
141128 a history museum is static a library is live thats the greatest difference i can put between them
141129 worked in a lot of museums around the country and they are not static they are not dead
141130 as the library has strengthened and embraced its regional branch libraries there are fewer reasons for many durham residents to come to the downtown branch
141131 if youre going to have a history center the economics of what you share is so small it really is its own economic piece there really isnt any free lunch regarding joint economic programming
141132 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
141133 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
141134 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
141135 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
141136 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
141137 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
141138 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
141139 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget

141148 the taiwan situation has undergone positive changes the development of relations between the two sides faces a rare historical opportunity
141149 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
141150 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
141151 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
141152 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
141153 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
141154 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater
141155 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
141156 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day
141157 its the type of thing we spend our careers trying to make sure does not occur
141158 that is not something you would want to leave to somebody else to have to pick up
141159 the bridge did collapse while i was the state bridge engineer so i feel i need to deal with it
141160 daily we spend time dealing with the aftermath of i 35w im not complaining
141161 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
141162 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare
141163 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics
141164 we are not protecting the governors butt any longer this has got to be done
141165 you can only fiddle with this stuff so long people dont like increases in taxes i dont but i dont know how else to pay for that

141186 this gene by itself does not appear to increase the risk for overall and for specific cardiovascular disease but rather this research suggests a possible connection between the gene variant and migraine with aura while it is too early to start testing young women with migraine with aura for this gene variant more focused research will help us to understand these complex links and will help us to potentially develop preventative strategies
141187 doctors should try to reduce heart disease risk factors and advise young women who experience migraine with aura not to smoke and to consider birth control pill alternatives as these increase the risk of ischemic vascular problems
141188 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
141189 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression

141237 masaya ko sa nangyari sa fashion show after knowing yung response ng tao pagkatapos mismo ng fashion show pero during that time the show itself wala talaga akong kaalam alam talaga kasi nga yung focus ko sa pagrampa ko
141238 kumbaga lahat ng comments these are all comments kumbaga iba ibang tao ang nagsasabi sa akin maaaring yung nagsabi sa akin yun ang tumili walang nagsabi sa akin na tumili lahat sinasabi nila nagustuhan nila
141239 but on the other hand para sa akin hindi importante sa akin kung ano ang naging reaction basta ginawa ko ang kailangan kong gawin as a model nag rehearse naman ako
141240 hindi lihim yun i even rehearsed on the day itself i dont think theres an artist who rehearsed on the day of the show itself pero ako nag rehearse pa ko sa mismong araw na yun
141241 you know what bench is an institution its a global company that wouldnt engage itself to intrigues or whatever that will jeopardize its beauty or the brand they should know better
141242 para sa akin hindi sila magpapagulo kahit kanino lalo na sa akin na bago lang ako sino ba naman ako bago lang ako sa bench family ako i gave what was assigned to me with artistry and taste para sa akin yun lang kasi meron akong gustong gawin meron akong gustong patunayan and it ends there without meron akong gustong patunayan sa iba wala kundi para sa sarili ko lang
141243 people will always have their own interpretation and i respect that what matters most to me is that ginawa ko kung ano ang gusto ko allowed verified and patented by bench para sa akin thats all that matters nag enjoy ako nag enjoy ang pamilya ko nag enjoy ang mga mahal ko sa buhay na nanonood para sa akin yun ang importante dahil nang rumarampa ako wala naman akong ibang naririnig
141244 people will always have their own opinion no matter what even the best thing in the world may be the worse for other people as long as for those who believe that this is good as long as it matters and for me i believe that what happened to me was good for people na nandoon para tumangkilik it was good din and thank you sa kanila
141245 unang una i dont believe na may sabotage na nangyari because kung meron man kahit ako hindi ako papayag because in everything that i do im fair with what explained to us we just follow all the rules and wala namang nangyaring ganoon
141246 i do not know her that much to criticize or to judge her feelings towards what happened thats why i do not want to talk anything about that
141247 richard never said any bad things about me since he started ive been his supporter in fact bilib ako on how he handles his career even before the show weve been supporting each other
141248 oh yes ako rin naman in fact in every endeavor of his kino congratulate ko siya because were on the same industry i know he has his own niche and to his niche he excels no one else will replace him nag umpisa siya inalagaan niya at nag iisa siya riyan
141249 alam nyo sana huwag e kasi ako i consider ourselves as teammates rather than rivals the truth is were on the same network so in fact naging director pa niya ko nang maging star siya ng
141250 i believe were part of the same team so sana huwag naman lagyan na parang pag personalin kaming dalawa
141251 hindi ko alam eh i feel that instead of us pondering on the time na ma hurt tayo dapat hindi eh
141252 malayo kasi sa interpretasyon nila yun nirerespeto ko yun wala akong kinokontra but at the end of the day there are facts and there are people who will attest to what they believed in so hindi natin puwedeng baguhin yun but i do not take it against anybody
141253 at the end of the day i will respect kung anuman ang sabihin nila much more my friendship with the gentleman richard gutierrez

141342 the main goal of the visit was to understand how israel in general and its academic institutions in particular has been so successful at commercializing research done at universities and in research hospitals
141343 the university of toronto is firmly opposed to an academic boycott of israeli institutions last year in criticizing the misguided call by the british universities and colleges union for a boycott debate and vote i indicated that we are not only fundamentally opposed to cutting ties but were very likely to increase our interactions not only with israeli universities but with a wide range of sister universities all over the world
141344 this trip was a chance to put those words into action and i was therefore proud to visit three outstanding israeli universities
141345 this trip underscored something ive suspected for a while namely that israeli apartheid week is ultimately irrelevant to the politics of the middle east the future of israel and its neighbours will not be decided by a small group of activists who talk mostly to themselves on a few north american university campuses
141346 the science i saw and heard about was world class and the commercialization environment is better developed than ours here in canada were looking at how wecan adapt some of the commercialization models in israeli universities and more generally whether canada might borrow from israels experience in building a hightecheconomy
141347 we got exactly what i hoped wed get lots of open exchanges with smart colleagues so that we could better understand the transformation of the israeli economy remember just a few decades ago israelis exports were overwhelmingly agricultural now israel and canada go back and forth in taking second place for the number of companies listed on nasdaq and the country has a booming high tech sector with massive exports
141348 they were direct and warm there was a palpable seriousness of purpose not surprising given the history of the region but the colleagues in general didnt take themselves seriously that was refreshing because academics in north america can be pretty earnest

141383 noch nie zuvor gab es in nieder sterreich so viele besch ftigte wie heuer die sensationelle entwicklung am arbeitsmarkt h lt nun schon seit mehr als 2 jahren ungebremst an und ist auf eine aktive besch ftigungs und arbeitsmarktpolitik zur ckzuf hren

141387 die einfache umgehung des parlaments als kontrollorgan an sich ist schon skandal s zu hinterfragen ist aber auch das schweigen von barbara prammer die als pr sidentin auch die verantwortung zur einhaltung der parlamentarischen rechte und pflichten verantwortlich ist bisher hat sie den umgehungsmethoden des verteidigungsministers kommentarlos und tatenlos zugesehen und seine verpflichtungen gegen ber dem nationalrat n mlich die bermittlung des gesamten eurofighter berichts nicht eingefordert ein zeichen daf r dass auch die nationalratspr sidentin die untergrabung der parlamentarischen kontrollrechte von darabos unterst tzt
141388 die pr sidentin hat beispielsweise in der pr sidialsitzung zugesagt die gesamte vorlage des rohberichts einzufordern der entsprechende antrag daf r wurde brigens bereits am 29 mai mit gegenstimmen der sp gestellt bisher fand es die pr sidentin weder der m he wert die abgeordneten zu informieren noch druck auf den minister auszu ben
141389 jedoch teile des berichts einer sterreichischen wochenzeitung weiterzugeben aber die zuleitung dem parlament aus rechtlichen bedenken zu verwehren ist eine verh hnung des gesamten nationalrats

141403 mit seinem jetzigen vorschlag schafft molterer wiederum eine zweiklassen pflege und bersieht vor allem die gro e zahl jener menschen die z b an demenz leiden in den pflegegeldstufen 1 und 2 sind aber wesentlich mehr unterst tzung brauchen
141404 au erdem l uft sich diese einseitige erh hung bei den stufen 6 und 7 mehr auf eine f rderung der pflegeheime als der pflegebed rftigen hinaus

141461 the kind of things that keep you awake at night as governor are what might come to our state and the risk that might occur
141462 i dont support it i just think its unfortunate that were playing games with the future of the citizens of the state of florida
141463 im just so frustrated that weve let our leadership play this game with the taxpayers and the consumers
141464 its not an easy issue to resolve but its one where weve got to try competition
141465 the problem that florida has right now is that we have a windstorm insurance policy that really only works if there are no windstorms
141466 everybody is gambling we are gambling that we dont have a major storm
141467 mr buffett is gambling that he can make money off us by not having a major storm
141468 he had a lot of hope that theyll come up with a cure in his time he tried not to let als stop him and tried to acquire all the medical equipment that helped him stay active
141469 he wanted to make sure workers were taken care of he cared about the blue collar workers
141470 he used his hands and needed his hands and that was one of the first muscle groups that were affected
141471 one of his favorite things to say to me was everyday is a school day
141472 there are a lot of things that have gone on historically that have divided people from one another
141473 that has sort of made it that there are different churches meeting together with those they are comfortable with churches tend to be like society a lot of times i think we want them to be all angels but the trouble is they are all people
141474 if we serve together we can do it better if we can get beyond the issues the politics and theology and serve together we can do a lot more
141475 the best help is to show the positive things that are going on and not get caught up in the negative things
141476 the goal is to assist ex offenders back into society to make them successful and make them tax paying citizens as opposed to being a burden in society
141477 there are so many different resources out in the community
141478 we are trying to pull all those resources together and work as one umbrella
141479 we know we are not going to reach every one of them but those who want assistance thats what we are trying to do
141480 we got together and we said we have a problem
141481 right now on record we have 872 people that have basically registered a plan with the state department of corrections to return to marion county thats not counting the 16 000 people that rotate through the county jail nor the people that may come from coleman the largest federal prison in america

141495 my wife and i have been married for almost 20 years
141496 she was 53 and i was 41 when we met we both shared many values including our faith our children are grown up now and mine love her so its worked out very well i tell men who have been divorced at least once to go for an older woman if you find the right one dont worry about age unless you still want more children
141497 a woman can be 25 and marry a man of 45 or 55 and hey whatever traditionally its been ingrained in our psyches thats the way it goes but not the other way around weve always known that age may be an issue but now that weve been together for a while i have a new perspective
141498 i dated a woman who is 15 years older we dated for a bit and then settled into just enjoying each others company she has a fit body and is an attractive woman people said to me why dont i commit to her if we enjoy each others company i told them i worried about how things would feel in 10 years when shes over 60 and im in my 40s and then further down the years
141499 kaspars knows we intend to play good attractive football and he wants to be a part of it weve signed an international defender who has a great physical presence good pace and is comfortable on the ball hes an ambitious lad who wants to take his game forward
141500 yes i am now i had some problems but weve turned things around and i am quite happy with how it is going so far
141501 i have to say the backing ive had during these weeks and months from the team has been very good
141502 things have changed a lot probably since canada although i still had qualifying problems there i had good race pace and could have won
141503 since then qualifying has been better apart from at hockenheim where i made a mistake
141504 but over the weekend the result was good and without the mistake i would have made it into the top 10
141505 i did the fastest race lap again like earlier in the season in malaysia and i have had two second places in four races
141506 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
141507 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk

141547 we were suffering from certain applications and websites requiring too much bandwidth on our network which ultimately slowed the internet to a crawl
141548 we were getting flooded with complaints all across the board from individuals who were at a standstill
141549 they were demonstrating the capabilities of the network composer dc30 and i was sold on it immediately
141550 we wanted a solution that not only met our content filtering demands and control bandwidth but also fit within our budget the quality of the network composer is unbeatable
141551 we knew we were on to something when the complaints transitioned from lagging internet speeds to the inability to access certain websites that we as a district had opted to block turns out there were teachers who were engaging in internet gaming and students had been bypassing our filters
141552 the network composer has since put a stop to these activities and even helped us locate a group of computers whose settings had been manipulated causing them to hammer the internet searching for updates which was actually responsible for more than 50 percent of our bandwidth usage overall its been an easy process and weve been able to eliminate all of our network issues

141560 today i can state that saab and the norwegian business community have identified collaboration projects to such an extent that we can now increase our commitment regarding industrial collaboration projects to at least 180 percent of the offset value over a period of 10 15 years our discussions will continue

141631 with the first round of the governments economic stimulus checks having been mailed in early may one would have hoped they would have bolstered online spending in may and june

141659 some people think they have acne many people may have pimples from it and the difference is there are no black heads associated redness and very often looking for reality finding the breakfast club chicago tribune
141660 this clearly shows how the government wants to work closely with local authorities and is being receptive to the views of local people on this important issue
141661 it will now be rigorously assessed alongside the other bids to ensure only those with the highest standards make it through to the final short list
141662 we are talking from the same hymn sheet trying to create zero carbon properties
141663 rackheath is a much better option than coltishall for meeting the governments ecotown objectives
141664 it is better prepared to shoulder new infrastructure and the local landowners are ready for development most importantly the plans are already going through a comprehensive rigorous and democratic planning process so that local people will be fully involved along the way

141673 hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
141674 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
141675 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
141676 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
141677 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us

141679 these kids are absolutely normal even though their parents are suffering from leprosy but yet they have been condemned from the facilities of society even though having provision of government reservation for them they dont get work we thought of establishing them in the society through education with a one point programme of sending their children away from this atmosphere to study
141680 i am going to haridwar to study and become a doctor when i grow up
141681 i never studied here but i want to stay in haridwar and study so that even i can be successful one day
141682 i face a lot of problem when nobody gives admission to my children in schools they had problem with our disease therefore i am sending them to haridwar so that they can study
141683 mariah has been busy in the studio while nick has been filming for his tv series
141684 so as soon as the pair get some free time they will be jetting out to their new pad to make up for lost time
141685 it gave me headaches i found it so uncomfortable to sleep then two of my extensions came out and took my own hair with it
141686 it was really uncomfortable and sore i had little broken bits of hair all over my head and little tufts coming out
141687 traction alopecia is what its called where the whole hair shaft has been pulled out its major damage to a very delicate structure
141688 you may get away with having your hair pulled out that way a few times but eventually the follicle will shut down
141689 as long as that stylist has been educated in to how to use that hair and the correct way to apply it and the clients been informed on how to do the maintenance then there will be no problems
141690 the gulf between good quality hair extensions and the lower end of the market is widening
141691 we are definitely seeing a rise in the number of young girls who have experimented with cheap do it yourself extensions that have damaged their hair and who come to racoon salons to sort out the mess
141692 we know virtually nothing about this art thats the exciting part of this discovery
141693 what we need to do now is to discover how this art relates to other prehistoric features in the landscape
141694 we are talking about very simple and abstract art using circles lines and triangles mostly the designs are pecked into stone in the shape of simple cups and rings
141695 we are sure there remains a lot that is still undiscovered in cumbria
141696 the president remains the major destabilising factor for the coalition government
141697 i was in shock i could not move i could not do anything
141698 after this we are ordering dna tests for all children whose mothers present credible indications that they were abducted and we are asking parents of those two babies in the u s to voluntarily submit dna tests of their adoptive children
141699 motorists are advised to exercise extreme caution when driving leaving a good safe distance between themselves and the vehicle in front and not to make journeys unless absolutely necessary
141700 some places had more than half their monthly amount in one night so it is not surprising it caused some flooding
141701 the worst of the rain was in the north east
141702 there was much less rain over the rest of england and wales
141703 there is no evidence this was a targeted break in but you simply dont know
141704 on the whole our findings suggest that marriage is a better predictor of parenting quality with regard to social fathers than biological fathers
141705 our study is relevant to understanding the quality of parental care that children receive from resident fathers across a range of family configurations that are now commonly experienced by children
141706 the crime has signs of premeditation he called cara to his apartment put the music on high volume and killed her with knife blows he then took her body to the bathroom and then he went off to a party it was only the following day he dismembered the girls body
141707 he took various photos of the chopped up body with his cellphones camera including photos like those of the taliban
141708 he was in the uk illegally and its probable that he was interested in getting married in order to allow him to stay in the uk
141709 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
141710 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
141711 one day a friend said to try it and i thought why not
141712 everyone seems to like it when i lift their cars
141713 in places like where i grew up and where i worked there are incredibly high hiv and std rates
141714 this card opens up the conversation for people to talk about it
141715 our findings indicate that the initial hospital costs associated with penetrating trauma are substantial and vary to a considerable degree by patient injury and treatment characteristics
141716 although the costs of penetrating trauma resulting from shooting are higher than from stabbing the most commonly used weapon in violent crime in england and wales is actually a knife
141717 at an average cost of 7 699 pounds per penetrating injury from alleged assault and a total of 417 injuries per year requiring hospitalisation for at least three days the total acute care cost of this type of injury alone may exceed 3 2 million pounds annually
141718 public health initiatives that aim to reduce the incidence and severity of penetrating trauma are therefore likely to produce significant savings in acute trauma care costs she added
141719 considering the additional medical costs of rehabilitation and broader costs to society resulting from lost productivity permanent disability premature death and the pain and suffering of the victims and their families there is a compelling argument for money to be better spent on prevention strategies that reduce violent incidents
141720 it should be borne in mind that most of the cost of trauma especially stabbing is not to the health service but in billions per annum to the taxpayer through legal costs loss of productive tax paying years in those that die or are severely disabled and in long term care
141721 we want uthayakumar to say that the medicine he had with him appeared in the police search list but it was missing in the detention centres list he had the medicine when he was moved there we are dealing with a mans life
141722 the court is ready to hear it and so is the senior federal counsel but you are giving all sorts of excuses if you want this man to be either set free or admitted to a hospital you should proceed now if this was a civil court and you didnt follow the case management directions i would have thrown this case out it is a waste of time to file more affidavits
141723 this is a great opportunity for us to show chinese readers what first class journalism we can deliver
141724 but of course we will also want to check if the site is still available after the olympics have ended
141725 this is a good sign its a work in progress these are initial encouraging signs
141726 she victoria is hot funny and lets not forget her success with the spice girls
141727 she has not been approached but the beckham boys are big fans of high school musical
141728 she is not going to submit the signed request people are still circulating petitions on her behalf but this is a done deal
141729 hillary clinton is 100 committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters
141730 i find it particularly interesting that fish are capable of such a sophisticated behavior the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur
141731 future studies will need to evaluate the potential for male mate choice copying and deception in natural populations because male mate choice copying cannot be evolutionarily stable if males always have an opportunity to deceive rivals
141732 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
141733 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
141734 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects
141735 the survey results reveal that a sexy stomach isnt governed by age which is good news for all those wanting to tone up or maintain a flat tummy
141736 i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than radovan karadzic and saddam hussein
141737 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
141738 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation into the origins of life and planets
141739 this is an unfortunate event and not something we are very pleased about we sincerely hope to bring to our fans brighter news in the days to come

141742 these findings reinforce the fact that women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy
141743 prenatal exposure to alcohol especially excessive amounts at one time can adversely affect the foetus and may increase the risk of infant clefts
141744 the greater the blood alcohol concentration the longer the foetus is exposed a single binge during a critical period of an infants development can be harmful

141752 the most important aspect of the dpp 2008 is that it will enable the ministry to be more transparent in procurement and at the same time it will be speedy and avoid delays
141753 service headquarters will now approve cases of up to rs 50 crore financial power delegated to defence secretary has been enhanced to rs 75 crore and only cases above 100 crore will be brought before the defence acquisition council
141754 given the worlds reliance on coal we need to find ways to make it a cleaner energy source were delighted to be working with our partners in china to help find solutions to this global challenge
141755 in a recent visit to china prime minister kevin rudd said that china was the largest consumer of coal in the world and australia was the worlds largest exporter of coal as such australia and china should work together develop low emissions coal technologies
141756 it will allow pcc technology to be progressed in the chinese energy sector which will have a much greater impact than operating in australia alone
141757 the next steps in the research would be moving to a much larger demonstration phase before then progressing to a full scale system
141758 using common and affordable elements and a glass of water these chemists may have given us a future way to efficiently obtain oxygen by splitting water
141759 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism
141760 we have taken action against the huji we share actionable intelligence with india which is less publicised but very effective
141761 this president is making it impossible for congress to do oversight of the intelligence community
141762 the only effective oversight that can be done is out of the executive branch and this is the fox guarding the chicken coop
141763 we have secret laws governing secret agencies that are engaging in secret spying against americans and theyre using our own tax dollars to do it this isnt keeping us safer its only making all americans suspects in the eyes of the government

141766 weve taken a browbeating from people who dont like the aesthetics of it
141767 but its perfectly good protein meal and with food and feed prices what they are we shouldnt be so wasteful as to throw it away
141768 however most animals are still allowed to eat meat from their own species
141769 under current law pigs chickens and turkeys that have been fed rendered cattle can be rendered and fed back to cattle a loophole that may allow mad cow agents to infect healthy cattle
141770 animal feed legally can contain rendered road kill dead horses and euthanized cats and dogs
141771 while this industrialized system of food animal production may result in increased production efficiencies some of the changes in animal feeding practices may result in unintended adverse health consequences for consumers of animal based food products
141772 currently the use of animal feed ingredients including rendered animal products animal waste antibiotics metals and fats could result in higher levels of bacteria antibioticresistant bacteria prions arsenic and dioxinlike compounds in animals and resulting animal based food products intended for human consumption subsequent human health effects among consumers could include increases in bacterial infections antibioticresistant and nonresistant and increases in the risk of developing chronic often fatal diseases such as vcjd

141776 a cambio del dinero que aportan las corporaciones los partidos a trav s de los comit s anfitriones ofrecen acceso a pol ticos de alto nivel al presidente al futuro presidente al vicepresidente a miembros del gabinete senadores congresistas

141779 thanks for your card sorry that you had such a rough time of it on the pill
141780 i just wanted to make sure that none of the symptoms i experienced during those 3 months are suggestive of anything that would effect that cycle
141781 no although it is surprising that you feel better off the pill
141782 well clare went to see another doctor who she didnt like a hormone no a endocrinolologist no wait well a doctor
141783 well not really the day i saw her i think it might have been a bad day at the office
141784 well i know its important to sort out the hormone replacement and i dont know who to go to for that bit of things but for now i am assuming i can wait until after the cycle to start thinking about hrt
141785 yes if you get pregenant you dont have to start the hrt until you finish breastfeeding
141786 otherwise we can discuss things when you are ready a few months without estrogen isnt going to be the end of the world we just cant let it go for too long
141787 and just for the record if the cycle doesnt work i suspect that i will not be in an emotional place to introduce the pill for awhile

141797 i have often wondered if it would be such a disservice to mankind if doctors were not so understanding of the psychological side of things the possibility of a serious illness being missed is of course a major concern when a patient seeks help for one reason or another to put psychological conditions at the top of the list of possible diagnosis is dangerous
141798 the patient was sure someone was trying to harm her
141799 for more on how listening even when what is being said sounds improbable is an important skill check out the cockroach catchers post about a talking yucca and a stowaway family of tarantulas

141826 in the battle of iraq the united states and our allies have prevailed
141827 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
141828 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
141829 within the context of a very difficult operating environment ba management is doing all the right things
141830 it is managing fares up cutting capacity and seeking strategic tie ups that will provide future synergies that will allow it to inch its way back to economic returns
141831 it is absolutely unavoidable that as hedging unwinds we will have to reflect the significant increase in the price of oil in our fares
141832 if people are concerned about jobs that can only be good news
141833 we see new fuel efficient aircraft as being a critical part of the answer to high oil prices
141834 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
141835 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
141836 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
141837 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
141838 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
141839 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
141840 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase

141855 i have to accept that i appear to be the fall guy and may be the fall guy
141856 its learning of it at almost the last minute that i think is destabilizing the international media and certainly embarrassing for me as up till 48 hours ago i was insisting it would be free and uncensored internet access
141857 i suspect an agreement has been reached or an understanding has been reached
141858 it may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc it may have taken into consideration new circumstances in this year leading up to the games where there has been quite a lot of trauma around china and within china
141859 this certainly isnt what we guaranteed the international media and its certainly contrary to normal circumstances of reporting on olympic games
141860 weve noticed that the words being used by bocog have changed in recent months from uncensored to what is more like convenient and timely or convenient and available these are quite different words
141861 nevertheless no one has come out publicly and said on behalf of bocog or the ioc sorry but there are certain internet websites which are blocked
141862 were working with the organizers to understand what the issues are here
141863 as for how the international olympic committee understands these regulations thats its own affair

141891 with so much customer experience you should be in a good position to get a helpdesk role from this you can keep notes of the most common issues and then focus on where your skills need to be then the company will probably move you into a more technical support role if you show the proficiency and just as important the willingness to learn
141892 just a quick comment learning is fun i enjoy nothing better than to prove how geeky i am to friends by showing them how to do subnetting and vlsm yes i am sad and looking at the blankness on their faces but i learned that and its a great feeling having new knowledge

141899 alex salmond came to dumfries just to claim what a great job hes doing but his visit will be judged by the fact that he came empty handed
141900 he brought no commitment of government support for the regeneration of the town centre and he brought no cash to plug the 12 million funding gap that his government has imposed on our local health service
141901 this was not a listening exercise it was a back slapping ego trip
141902 for the first time since the scottish parliament was reconvened government has moved out of edinburgh to meet the rest of the country
141903 not only that ministers spent much of their time meeting as many local people as they possibly could
141904 you could not find a more different and positive style of government to that of gordon brown if you tried

141918 this clearly shows how the government wants to work closely with local authorities and is being receptive to the views of local people on this important issue
141919 it will now be rigorously assessed alongside the other bids to ensure only those with the highest standards make it through to the final short list
141920 we are talking from the same hymn sheet trying to create zero carbon properties
141921 rackheath is a much better option than coltishall for meeting the governments ecotown objectives
141922 it is better prepared to shoulder new infrastructure and the local landowners are ready for development most importantly the plans are already going through a comprehensive rigorous and democratic planning process so that local people will be fully involved along the way
141923 its going to be the nonfarm payrolls that dominate by a long stretch
141924 the euro took a hit after disappointing german retail sales caused speculation to intensify about a very weak gdp number
141925 the risks of a manufacturing recession are spreading across the euro area with even germany now seeing growth splutter to near stagnation as order books contract
141926 yet another sign that the u k economy is probably slipping into recession but that inflation is likely to rise further in the coming months
141927 theres just not enough advice for new expats coming here
141928 so people rely on blogs online forums word of mouth and the dubai urban myths that you get told by the taxi drivers when you arrive
141929 saying you dont know about the law is not an excuse
141930 the law will not accept it if youve been acting inappropriately in a common place or a public place whether youre in hyde park or on jumeirah beach i think you will face the same consequences
141931 business people go along wanting easy answers and they just come and they say tell me the dos and donts
141932 but all these dos and donts are based on looking at the external perceptions of culture

141938 the failures of the economy despite the fact that we grew for seven years to provide rising levels of income and wages for the american people i think indicates the degree to which weve got to fundamentally shift how we approach economic policy
141939 the bush policies are not the sole cause of the economic problems but they have not helped
141940 more of the same thats what john mccain is offering
141941 john mccains policy is all around creating jobs that is the no 1 priority for the tax policy
141942 the choice in this election is stark and simple sen obama will raise your taxes i wont
141943 if the tax cuts substantially raise the national debt the increase in borrowing by the federal government could crowd out private investment and consumers purchases of homes and durable goods which could slow the economy

141961 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
141962 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
141963 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
141964 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
141965 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
141966 im a positive and strong minded person and have worked really hard to get back it was a career threatening injury so i have had to take my time
141967 but i feel great i felt i could have played the full 90 minutes but ill take it slowly one day at a time and see how i come through it
141968 it was good to be back out there albeit in a behind closed doors game i felt comfortable and i didnt hold back
141969 hopefully now ill get another game soon and i can start to put a bit of pressure on martin laursen and zat knight who have been the first team partnership
141970 but long term i am aiming to come back fitter and stronger and push myself into the full england squad and then maybe make a debut
141971 the fact i made the 30 for the new managers first squad gave me a lot of heart and determination to try to push on and kick into that squad
141972 if i wasnt aiming for that id be standing still of course it is going to be hard with the strength england have in the centre half positions but im going to keep striving for it it really was a massive boost to get into that 30
141973 i wasnt expecting to be in the thoughts even though i played a few games in front of mr capello and did okay in a couple of games
141974 i just wasnt expecting it but it gives you that carrot to aim for in the future
141975 one of the main reasons for the regulatory committees dispute of our application was the worry that a new home for static systems within the village might not be found
141976 we have now satisfied the queries set out by the council which not only strengthens our position to provide wombourne with a supermarket
141977 in fact through our partnership with static systems we will be helping to safeguard 350 jobs as well as creating 250 of our own
141978 i want to win i always do but in one sense the result doesnt concern me because it doesnt matter
141979 i want to play well i want to see the team play well because i think we can do its been my best pre season at wolves
141980 i dont think it could have gone more smoothly weve had no serious injuries and although we suddenly got two or three last week they will all be fit for tomorrow
141981 while the results dont matter the form of the team up to this point has been pleasing
141982 this is a good game for us because blackburn are a good side but i could not have asked for more at this stage
141983 if i had to go into the season with this group i would not be upset
141984 so ridiculously ludicrous and insulting that i bet no other site has reviewed this
141985 and i think that is the argument that weve got to have and im quite sure we can have that argument and im quite sure we can win that argument
141986 of course we can win with gordon as our leader that is absolutely what im saying

141995 if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
141996 lord here is another reason why i needed a savior thank you for saving me and cleansing me from all my sins including this one i am sorry i agree with you that this is sin thank you that you already forgave me for this sin i repent and ask you to help me not do this again fill me with your spirit and help me to grow into the image of christ

142027 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
142028 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
142029 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way
142030 we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out
142031 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
142032 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
142033 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy
142034 on the whole our findings suggest that marriage is a better predictor of parenting quality with regard to social fathers than biological fathers

142038 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing
142039 the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
142040 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
142041 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts
142042 it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv

142067 it is critically important for linux to have an easy way for software developers to write to distro n whether its red hat ubuntu or novell
142068 the future of linux that i would love to see is upstream projects adopting our tests
142069 look at a project like ruby and they have a model that when you write code you submit a test along with it it makes the project high quality because of the rigorous tests
142070 the thing that i want to see from the lsb and the linux developer network is a set of dead simple tools so that isvs can take advantage of the standardization work weve done
142071 the standard is not punitive and no one will go to jail if they dont comply with the lsb
142072 there will be application vendors that will want to certify to lsb 4 as there will be broad enough coverage in the specification for them to build multidistribution applications
142073 our tools are a quantum leap ahead of where we used to be
142074 the bar for costs of certifying to linux foundation lsb is largely a development issue
142075 when you certify to a red hat novell or ubuntu the bar is by and large a channel partnership and a support infrastructure which is a higher cost than the development component

142266 as shocking as this deficit figure is thats still not the true scope of our budget woes because it excludes 80 billion in war costs and 227 billion borrowed from the social security trust fund

142271 in stunning hypocrisy the white house blamed the record budget deficit on the slowing economy and the 150 billion stimulus package passed earlier this year

142316 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
142317 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
142318 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
142319 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means
142320 american public if you get the right incident the american public will support bang bang kiss kiss you know were into it
142321 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states
142322 but it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements

142332 one of my favorite features on the story siren is the author tales
142333 i love the author interviews you do they give so much extra insight into the books
142334 i would like to see you asking your readers which authors they want to be interviewed you know ask your readers for more feedback
142335 sometimes in your reviews there are some grammer mistakes that i catch
142336 i ve noticed in the past that sometimes you have quite a few typos
142337 more interviews or maybe more about debut authors maybe even book lists
142338 i would like to see more book recommendations on the site
142339 your page is a bit too busy and can be distracting
142340 i would have to say that the only thing that i dont like to much is your backdrop to the whole site
142341 i feel bad saying anything but i dont like the gray background its dull not a color i would think of with ya books
142342 well i pretty much like the whole site the way it is but i suppose it would be nice if it were more colorful
142343 maybe a message board would be nice a place where everyone could start up their own discussions with you and with one another
142344 i would love to see a book discussion area or book club or something
142345 i really like the site already but id like to see some discussion boards about the books
142346 i dont think i like the guest reviewer segments that you have
142347 my least favorite thing is the guest review on the weekend
142348 gordon is the perfect appointment to this role everyone knows gordon hes worked in fundraising around the world and as hes been a regular at ifc throughout this decade he totally understands the value of this congress
142349 the fate of a sweet and promising child depended on the willingness of a number of particular adults to do the bare minimum of what they were supposed to do
142350 had just one of them performed their duty or done their job danieal would be alive today
142351 the grand jury has no doubt that he never prepared these documents
142352 what i can tell you is the internal accountability was weak and the demand for external accountability from providers was equally weak
142353 when that happens there are a lot of risks in the system
142354 i dont want them to test the notes for the ink to see if they had been written earlier
142355 this is the case that is going to take the mayor down
142356 this has been a sad sad day for all of us
142357 everyone at revel entertainment is deeply saddened by todays tragedy
142358 the thoughts and prayers of our entire organization are with the family and friends of todays victims
142359 she looked like a nice businesswoman she seemed like a very peaceful happy woman
142360 if i wasnt 63 years old and seen a lot in my life i would have been shocked
142361 she was in the room for discussions about what legislative goals would be set what the strategy would be to pursue those goals and was it appears being paid to share that information with the gun lobby
142362 its surprising that the nra had nothing better to do but put a mole into an organization such as ceasefire pa
142363 it shows what radical ideologues have to do when they dont have the public or citizens on their side they cheat
142364 she must be very good at what she does because a whole bunch of very smart people were completely hoodwinked by this
142365 she was in my guest room was she looking through stuff in my house
142366 i actually think she helped the movement rather than hurt the movement through all her volunteer efforts
142367 i just dont see what she could have gained in terms of damaging information
142368 we thought she was sort of a flake and not so bright but hardworking and ready to show up for anything
142369 for me it is going to be an amazing thing to be part of such an event
142370 you grow up as a kid watching the olympics all the sports it is going to be a great experience for all of the guys and we will be going there to be successful
142371 i dont look at myself as 36 and i certainly dont feel 36
142372 for me it is more about the mentality and i think i have a little more upstairs as far as experience that will help me
142373 the fire will be very happy to have brian back and we feel that way about him on the olympic team
142374 the teams spirit is a very important factor and we want to make sure these guys will fight for each other understand each other and stick together as friends
142375 they need to stay focused and concentrated you want to have a group of players that can create something special brian has seen it all in the game and the other guys can learn a lot from him
142376 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
142377 i do not believe there is anyone who doesnt know that i am in detention

142380 there was no deal it would have been immoral illegal and disgraceful
142381 indicates everything dhs does not stand for and intends to correct
142382 those individuals who were most directly involved in danieals neglect and death
142383 this is not to diminish or excuse the reprehensible failure to do their jobs by dhs employees at all levels of the organization a share of the stain of responsibility for danieals death remains on their hands
142384 that is why dhs and the private company hired by dhs exist yet these agencies whose sole function is to be protecting children from such parents passed up almost every opportunity over a period of years to save danieal
142385 he was a complete no show except to set up fraudulent billing for services never rendered
142386 organized and perpetuated the fraud that led to danieal kellys death
142387 how could parents have been so unloving how could professionals have been so indifferent and most of all how could the philadelphia department of human services the giant expensive safety net we have set up to protect the children of uncaring or incompetent parents have been so uncaring and incompetent

142427 not that im an expert on all these religions but what i know about all the other major religions kind of all just fall a little flat in their i guess just in their kind of narrowmindedness i feel like theres something much more basic than what all these people are worried about i find it really shocking that two groups that are from an outsiders perspective almost identical you know shiites and sunnis or catholics and protestants can actually kill each other over these minor details
142428 well i guess its to me you know pretty much commonsense you can only really understand good if you have bad so the idea of heaven or anything that happens for eternity even if its nice i cant imagine it being nice forever even the idea of forever is kind of ridiculous which is unfortunate because its kind of a nice thing to say you know i think it softens the blow of mortality and having to say goodbye to everything you know and everyone you love and all that kind of thing i think its a nice concept and i wish it made sense to me but i guess it doesnt
142429 i guess im just conflicted i mean i want to find something like that badly but in all the forms where its been offered to me they seem fraudulent
142430 my family is catholic i went to a catholic school that kind of thing so that was my childhood for sure

142454 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office
142455 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state

142459 the extremely heavy rain that stirling experienced on tuesday evening appears to have caused this problem but has also increased the amount of water in the river meaning the oil has begun to break up and disperse
142460 we are working with cornton vale to ensure a similar incident does not happen again
142461 there was a small amount of oil in the culvert which was washed into the river during the heavy rain storm
142462 a fisherman noticed it and alerted us and we then contacted sepa its difficult to say how much oil there was exactly but we are talking about a very small amount

142478 em nome do ps dos a ores e mandatado pelo ps nacional

142482 i was investigating installing solar water heating for my family home and realised that there was no comprehensive point of reference where i could find the information and contacts i needed with so much focus on global warming it was obvious that there was a huge gap in the market for this kind of website we are very excited about how the website will serve both people and businesses and help to accelerate the use of renewable technology within the uk
142483 national trends show that renewable energy isnt a choice for businesses to buy into any more but a necessity in order to maintain the sustainability of the planet this website provides a huge range of resources and has one of the only fully comprehensive directories of companies relating to renewable energy in the uk
142484 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
142485 we have been studying for 18 months and were overjoyed when we heard we had received distinction grades
142486 we also looked at sustainability and how to cut down on waste we studied event management and how to run a business as well as doing a four hour practical exam and three hours of theory there is a lot more to floristry than meets the eye
142487 from september 2009 we should be running the course at the cedars
142488 this will mean we are the only place in england to run the course and we have already had some enquiries the uk is generally thought to be behind the rest of europe when it comes to floristry
142489 florists in england are starting to have more european influences but it is actually the germans who are ahead of everyone else
142490 the germans study for six years to become a master florist and they look at the science behind the flowers it is a lot more than just putting some flowers into a block of oasis
142491 last year we had 150 florist students at the centre and i think people with florist businesses are starting to realise how important it is to have well trained staff
142492 we did the course for the good of the cedars which regularly supplies flowers for events such as weddings and funerals and we are usually cheaper than in the shops
142493 in a few years time wolverhampton will have some of the most highly trained florists in the country it will definitely be the place to be to get fantastic flowers
142494 it is such an important project we have appointed a specialist environmental and geo technical engineer to oversee the work which should be completed by the end of this year
142495 it is a great opportunity to bring the site back to life and we envisage investing around 2 million in the enabling works alone prior to the construction phase
142496 our overall investment in this site will extend to some 20 million

142502 it is a complicated set of issues and the chancellor is looking at all of these options sensibly and fairly as he always does
142503 we have got to encourage very significant investment into our power generation system over the next 10 to 15 years
142504 we have got to have a fiscal and regulatory climate that encourages all of that investment because quite simply it will go elsewhere if there is not the confidence in the uk market
142505 it is great for our sport that the competition is strong but it is sad we have four girls ranked in top thirty in the world and only two of us can go to the olympics it is very unfair that you are that high in the world and are not getting to go
142506 a further 20 per cent said that a dye job made them feel happier and more confident with their appearance
142507 nothing shall ever find a place in the universal register that can tend to wound the ear of delicacy or corrupt the heart

142510 that training session was a complete waste of time because on my first run i was avoiding individual seagulls and on my second run i found a flock of about 200 seagulls

142566 when you shoot a vehicle with regular photography you are limited with what you can show
142567 when you use cad data you can show and do just about anything
142568 other automakers are offering video displays or interactive 360 degree vehicle views
142569 but no one is using computer generated imagery to the extent that we are

142574 by blending visionary learning and research spaces with state of the art technology napiers sighthill campus is set to become a campus fit for 21st century learning and working maximising opportunities for interaction between students staff visitors and the local community
142575 the redevelopment of the sighthill campus is central to napiers ambitious 100m estate strategy launched in november 2006
142576 the proposed building creates an arrival point in the form of a large civic space leading to the main entrance on the eastern side of the building
142577 when i went into the office after filming all my colleagues had put up a big silver star on my door and they were saying this is my 15 minutes of fame
142578 it was good fun going around all the locations some of them had been chosen in advance like the castle but i suggested portobello beach as i thought people abroad might not realise the capital city had a lovely beach on its doorstep
142579 it was very nerve wracking though i always sit at home and think how easy it must be to work in tv but after this i have a lot more respect for them
142580 the folk at work were all really supportive when they saw the film and theyve been playing it on the screens at work
142581 it was good fun and if i got a bit more notice next time i might do it again
142582 although people might be familiar with the locations royal mail have created an insiders guide to some of the hidden secrets from around the country
142583 i note that this alert has been billed as unprecedented but visitscotland ultimately have an interest in promoting edinburgh to the world
142584 looking to the longer term we have to recognise that times are difficult at the moment but it wont last forever and we do need additional hotel space
142585 the scottish government has set a target of 50 per cent tourism growth by 2015 and the area thats going to have to try to deliver that growth is edinburgh
142586 the city is the most important destination for business and leisure tourism and we need to have quality hotel and leisure facilities to accommodate them
142587 we are in the middle of a credit crunch and a global slowdown yes we are facing challenges in the short term but we have to look to the future
142588 its pretty unheard of for so much accommodation to be available and theres no denying things have been slow
142589 ive certainly never heard of visitscotland doing anything like this in august before
142590 i know bookings are well down although the industry is pretty confident it will recover through last minute bookings
142591 were trying to spread the message that there is still plenty of opportunity for people to enjoy the citys fabulous festivals
142592 the benefits to the local community far outweigh the inconvenience to the police were trying to encourage local people to take part in sport
142593 the race was due to take place at 8am on sunday morning when the traffic is very light and disruption would be minimal we were happy to pay for all of the police support offered and the police said no they werent prepared to listen to any of our objections
142594 we have been in discussions with the organisers and at no point have we refused permission for this event however we do have significant concerns as regards the safety of the public and competitors particularly in terms of the volume of traffic on the proposed cycle route
142595 triathlons like this take place across scotland and as such it is extremely disappointing that the portobello event has had to be cancelled
142596 i hope that some arrangement can be made to ensure the event returns next year
142597 if the companies keep going on like this we could have almost half of all households in scotland being fuel poor this will already take us uncomfortably past one third of all households being fuel poor and if it keeps rising it will only get worse
142598 we thought the rise might be high something like 17 per cent but british gas blew that out of the water
142599 either they stop these price rises now or they should expect tough action against them
142600 the chancellor of the exchequer should make it clear that unless we see these companies show some decency then he should be prepared to introduce a windfall tax and then use that money to reduce peoples energy bills
142601 edinburgh waverley is one of the busiest stations in scotland and a key transport link for tourists and commuters in the capital
142602 it is vital that the station has the necessary facilities to meet the needs of all our customers and these proposals will not only improve the steps for the thousands who can already use them but make this entrance suitable for a wide range of users who are currently unable to access the station from princes street
142603 the redevelopment of the waverley steps will be funded as part of an overall 150m package of investment from transport scotland which has already delivered the recently completed platform track and signalling upgrades at the station
142604 network rail is also planning to invest significantly in the coming years on refurbishing the station roof and buildings
142605 all of these investments demonstrate everyones commitment to giving scotlands capital the best station possible and enhancing passengers journeys
142606 we have found in the past six months that the restaurant trade is under some pressure
142607 people are getting energy mortgage and fuel bill increases and something has got to give
142608 luxuries tend to be the first to feel the pinch and restaurants may be seen to be a luxury
142609 we are still getting the same number of covers that we were but average spending has dropped and that has meant lower revenues
142610 but i think edinburgh can overcome this its done a tremendous job in recent years ensuring that it is not just august and christmas that keeps businesses busy but its year round
142611 for small restaurants the share of the market is getting smaller but it pressurises all of us to be keen in terms of pricing and service and that can only be a good thing
142612 i really do think food is one of the last luxuries people will give up
142613 people always want a night out to get away from the tv ten years ago in these market conditions restaurants would have really suffered
142614 but people are now ingrained in the mindset of going out for a meal its become a natural thing they will not want to lose that
142615 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
142616 this approach suggests a new breed of council housing in edinburgh the council should be applauded for taking a proactive stance
142617 this is welcome news it is precisely what the council should be doing and its taken a long time to get here
142618 this is the first time in a generation that the council has considered building homes which marks a major shift in strategy and defining council housing in the 21st century
142619 i hope the people of edinburgh will be reassured that their council is responding to the obvious difficulties many of them face
142620 this council cannot turn its back on the huge social need which all of these under threat services provide the buck stops with them and they need to make every effort to make sure people are not stranded
142621 lothian buses is blaming the drop in passengers on the tram disruption a scheme which this administration brought to the city so it is up to the council to sort out the mess it causes
142622 the situation is deeply regrettable and i hope this is very much a last resort for lothian buses it is unfortunate that its least profitable routes are those with the arguably the highest social need
142623 we are acutely aware of how vital some of the affected services are for communities and are working hard to identify potential options for retaining the most socially important services
142624 they have a lot of expertise in the console area where were very headed in addition to pc and online
142625 activisions point of view is theres a lot of trust in blizzard and what we do activisions just trying to figure out how we work and try to learn from us
142626 a great example of this is our paid character transfer service which in its own way is sort of a microtransaction within wow the reason we introduced that service was because we thought it was a benefit that wow players needed and the pricing model was put there as a barrier to entry not a source of revenue
142627 i think we always look to make the game we want to make and then figure out the kind of financial model that works with that game
142628 america is the greatest nation on earth it is time for a change
142629 it was so frustrating as the journey there was incredibly long and not exactly easy we had paperwork to fill out everywhere and we were denied entry to croatia so we had to go around it
142630 when we finally got to egypt though it just became unbelievable we spent 30 hours in one place going from office to office filling out forms having the van searched i thought at one point we might never get out
142631 it is so frustrating as im sure there are lives we could have saved with this medicine
142632 i spoke to a doctor who works in gaza who was so appreciative that we had collected this medicine and that we were trying to bring it across
142633 we took our first 1m in two days and we are over 2m so we are on track to break even
142634 we are a large festival and we are working our way through the problems we have been having with our ticketing system
142635 the good news is thousands of tickets were collected at the fringe box office today and many thousands more were sold across the counters on the telephone and through edfringe com
142636 where there have been problems we are making an effort to get in contact with ticket buyers we are also posting regular updates on edfringe com so everyone has clear information on ticket collection arrangements
142637 we fully expect that the ballot of our members will deliver a strong vote in favour of action
142638 our members are clear that they cannot afford another series of below inflation pay increases
142639 window of opportunity to see if we can avoid disruptive strikes
142640 the club are delighted its all over and we are ready to move on to the next season and look forward to people concentrating on the football again
142641 despite that victory for common sense nothing less than the retention of the whole site for recreation is acceptable the facilities should be given a much needed upgrade by the council as soon as money becomes available
142642 selling off part of the site for housing is wrong and needs to be resisted with the same intensity as led to the victory over the first proposal
142643 meadowbank is a tremendous asset not just for east edinburgh but for the city as a whole we are lucky that meadowbank is close to the city centre it is time the council recognised it for the jewel that it is
142644 we welcome this continued support from the local mp and urge people to sign the petition to ask the scottish government to provide the money to fund meadowbanks refurbishment
142645 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved

142668 we have been a strong supporter of the stralis since taking delivery of our first model six years ago with the trucks returning a competitive fuel economy and proving reliable
142669 this latest model takes an already successful platform and improves it yet further with lots of extra room inside the cab for the driver even comfier bunks and seats and plenty of additional storage space the feedback from our drivers has been very positive and we have a tenth identical stralis set to join the fleet on 1 september as well

142674 the bridge collapse remains to me a symbol of a state and nation that hasnt paid sufficient attention to its infrastructure
142675 the new bridge shows what we can do when we focus our attention and resources now lets move on to the rest of the system
142676 the school still hadnt focused on that being their issue

142681 nist initially indicated that the spill was contained with no contamination outside the affected laboratory room and the adjacent hallway area
142682 will not be reapplying to the nuclear regulatory commission for permission to use plutonium or any other special nuclear materials at any time in the foreseeable future
142683 the most probable direct cause of the spread of the contamination outside the laboratory area is the multiple uncontrolled entries into and exits from the contaminated laboratory after the spill
142684 but it has to be done in a safe way
142685 i asked at the end of the hearing that nist along with the nuclear regulatory commission seriously consider releasing all those hazardous and radioactive materials that nist has on site or utilizes as long as there was not a national security concern that might be compromised

142690 brainchild of a self styled anarchist caffeine addict and conspiracy theorist
142691 paranoid conspiracy theorists headbangers goths and other caffeine freaks dedicated to detonating the typical gourmet coffee scene
142692 significant resources have been devoted to combating the methamphetamine epidemic in our state and we are deeply concerned that your marketing of meth coffee will perpetuate the use of this devastating drug
142693 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
142694 olmert told us his goal is to reach an agreement on paper
142695 reach an agreement with the palestinians during the time he has left
142696 any agreement he reaches with the palestinians wont be a personal agreement and he will make sure that the new kadima leadership is briefed and on board
142697 at this time of change in the government we must not reach agreements on the core issues in negotiations with the palestinians
142698 anything that is decided now is very problematic because it is happening before the change in the government and against the background of instability on the palestinian side
142699 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
142700 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
142701 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
142702 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
142703 the panic of last year is over its more orderly now but the financial stresses remain and there will be more difficulties to come
142704 the asset backed outstanding continues to creep a little lower
142705 no one is willing to touch the asset backed commercial paper because people are concerned about the intrinsic value of the underlying issues mortgage related securities
142706 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
142707 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
142708 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
142709 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
142710 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
142711 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
142712 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
142713 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
142714 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

142748 if somebody finds space in the penalty area and can finish he will do that as its something thats natural to him
142749 hes a great athlete but he has got that ability to find space in the penalty area and thats what we want there were a couple of premiership clubs interested but he wanted to come to us

142752 im sorry for the supporters and especially sorry for the chairman because hes done exactly what i wanted him to hes twice come up with 1 5 million for meteb and mifsud
142753 twice weve agreed with the clubs and twice weve agreed with the players but im only going to do things that are right for this football club i can promise the fans that
142754 both situations proved given certain incidents during negotiations with the players that they werent right ive discussed this with the chairman because its serious stuff when you pull out of deals having worked so hard following them
142755 sure they are in that hes got impact on the checks on the bridge of his nose over his shoulder over the backs of his hands and knuckles and even down around his knees and his chins
142756 gentle little people about 3 to 4 feet tall wearing halloween masks
142757 theyre just moving theyve been quiet theyve been going upstairs in the bedrooms and hiding behind the artifacts but they dont talk
142758 maam i dont have the time to tell you youll see it for yourself please send somebody over here
142759 no question about it this has been an extremely aggressive schedule
142760 theres something happening on this project 24 hours a day seven days a week
142761 people are really excited about whats rising from the ashes and theres a general feeling that this project has not only been done quickly its been done right
142762 the bridge collapse remains to me a symbol of a state and nation that hasnt paid sufficient attention to its infrastructure
142763 the new bridge shows what we can do when we focus our attention and resources now lets move on to the rest of the system
142764 we were asking our neighbors to sacrifice more at a time when they were already getting hammered and the dollar was already being weakened
142765 i believe that the people that we serve actually have a far greater capacity to embrace understand and make investments than sometimes we give them credit for
142766 the chickens of our bad math were coming home to roost
142767 while at the same time cutting income taxes for millionaires and everybody else
142768 you know ideologically he believed that government was the problem ideologically he believed that our government should be small and weak and hes delivered on his promises and his goals
142769 thats what our federal government has done in the past and i believe thats what were going to do again
142770 they were happy with the homicide numbers and didnt want to see a change in that
142771 of course i have no influence with those people in the drug world but i strongly suspected there would be a response and a response to that response
142772 i think the police knew that it wasnt the first time thered been a kidnapping in the city drug trade in general the response was predictable
142773 since we put so much time and care into these animals were very excited with this calfs arrival
142774 its feeding swimming and going up for air very well which are good signs
142775 this decision has secured ours and the sports future and now we can move forward
142776 i felt we would be successful but you can never be sure i feel fantastic now
142777 we bought the freehold five years ago but almost immediately we had planning applications hanging over our heads
142778 we have had improvements planned for some time but we knew if these plans went ahead we would have to close
142779 the centre is thriving and i think that was taken into account by the inspector who realised the importance of what we do
142780 that was one of the most difficult processes ive ever had to go through
142781 everybody in the village is very upset and very worried about the devaluation of their houses i know it is a bad time to sell anyway but the proposed windfarm doesnt help people to sell at all it will affect everybody as everyone will be able to see them
142782 i know we are going to have a fight as the government are all for these things but hopefully the council will be on our side
142783 there have been numerous cases in the same situation as us who have lost so we know we have got to be realistic about it but we are pretty hopeful as it is just not the right site we just hope that the council agree
142784 the stumbling block right now is that tdx is refusing to sell the city power
142785 they are spending a lot of money to have wind turbines sitting out there
142786 our loans wouldnt even allow us to sell that power plant
142787 in order for us to make our loans payments we need to sell power
142788 we are not in it for the money we are in it to provide electrical service to the village
142789 what are we supposed to do turn off the lights
142790 this has been a long process its been an education for all of us
142791 it would have a serious negative impact on the project
142792 i dont see why you need to wait for the attorney general to rule on this one
142793 the arrogance of this county board is at a level of un acceptance
142794 the staff is still working on the final language for the order
142795 they expect that no later than the next meeting on aug 14
142796 as soon as they said weve picked this level of power and these target areas there was a flurry of responses
142797 a wind turbine can be seen you cant hide it
142798 three and a half miles is a great distance of that ridge and it impacts every resident of fayette county thats what makes this case unusual they cant mitigate the effect of those turbines on that ridge
142799 whether we realize it or not most of us that have grown up here take that ridge that we affectionately call the mountain for granted
142800 but there is a quality of life thats provided by that view shed
142801 what happened here is the zoning hearing board substituted their judgment for that of the governing body to find that windmills should not be on chestnut ridge
142802 lots of people waive things that arent good for them they do it because theres money involved
142803 most people arent real warm and fuzzy about bats but bats are an important part of our ecosystem
142804 bats are really good at eating insects thats their job
142805 you cant put them near people they need to be at least a mile away

142819 we may give licences to up to 10 operators it depends on the availability of spectrum initially we will have five players in delhi and mumbai there will be two operators only the validity of the licence will be 20 years
142820 once the armed forces release spectrum we may accommodate more operators for 3g services
142821 we welcome the governments announcement of its 3g policy and believe this will benefit the entire wireless communications ecosystem
142822 3g will bring efficient voice and rich data services to indian consumers

142859 for taken as a whole atheism is not a spontaneous development but stems from a variety of causes including a critical reaction against religious beliefs and in some places against the christian religion in particular hence believers can have more than a little to do with the birth of atheism to the extent that they neglect their own training in the faith or teach erroneous doctrine or are deficient in their religious moral or social life they must be said to conceal rather than reveal the authentic face of god and religion

142900 wat willen ze dan dat mijn boek bijdraagt aan de haat
142901 ik ben met die paar zinnetjes zo lang bezig geweest ik heb voor het arabische woord rahiem alle nederlandse termen bedacht maar ik kwam uit bij de kern en die is lief rahiem was bij mij thuis lief je moeder is rahiem je tante is rahiem en lief was god wat moet ik dan met barmhartig het is als met het belastingkantoor leuker kunnen we het niet maken maar wel makkelijker
142902 maar dat is mijn probleem niet dat staat in het boek dat is een van de paradoxen van de koran allah zegt ik ben hard maar ik ben ook lief en het woord ongelovigen heeft in nederland een heel benauwde betekenis gekregen de ongelovigen dat zijn wij de nederlanders de niet moslims maar de ongelovigen zijn eigenlijk de ongehoorzamen de zondaars dat kunnen dus net zo goed moslims zijn
142903 als linkse ondergrondse rebel was ik erg tegen de koran
142904 ik heb bij mijn werk de koran van mijn vader gebruikt die ik kreeg toegestuurd toen hij door ouderdom niet meer kon lezen ik had het boek gekust en in de kast gezet het was verder niet aan mij besteed tot drie jaar geleden dan in een van zijn laatste columns in de volkskrant schreef kees fens over de bijbel en de koran als het boek van de vader ik heb er nog met kees over gepraat we kwamen tot de conclusie dat de zonen die de heilige boeken anders lezen dan hun vaders vooruitgang maken de zonen die de boeken exact hetzelfde lezen zijn achterlijk
142905 talent heb je stijl ontwikkel je ik ben in mijn jeugd be nvloed door amerikaanse verhalen vooral door the old man and the sea van hemingway dat ik las bij mijn tante in de bergen ondertussen groeide ik op in het huis van de moskee in een omgeving die doordrenkt was met de verhalen van 1001 nacht en met de koran als student kreeg ik honderd jaar eenzaamheid in handen van m rquez dat heeft me diepgaand be nvloed zoals m rquez geloof ik overal ter wereld de literatuur heeft be nvloed toen kwam ik naar nederland en ging ik de worsteling aan met de nederlandse taal en uit die culturele botsing van een literatuur van 3 000 jaar oud de perzische met een jong land nederland dat vierhonderd misschien maar tweehonderd jaar echte literaire geschiedenis kent ontstond een nieuwe kader abdolah
142906 als linkse ondergrondse rebel was ik erg tegen de koran
142907 het verlangen is er niet meer waarom niet mijn dromen geven mij antwoord als ik verlang naar huis te gaan ga ik in mijn slaap of in mijn gedachten naar huis en dat huis is veel mooier dan wanneer ik in een klm toestel stap en echt naar huis vlieg het huis dat ik verlang krijg ik in mijn boeken zelfs de doden krijg ik erbij via mijn boeken en in mijn slaap
142908 ik kwam naar nederland op een historisch moment het moment van de botsing tussen dit land en de migranten die er op grote schaal binnenkwamen toen kwam pim fortuyn balkenende 11 september moslimfanatici theo van gogh en geert wilders dat alles heeft mij be nvloed
142909 ik maakte grote veranderingen door de schrijver van de adelaars is een man uit de perzische traditie een man op zoek bovendien de schrijver van het huis van de moskee is door de nederlandse samenleving voortgebracht de oosterse literatuur is rond en vloeiend zo rond als de koepels van hun moskee n de nederlandse literatuur gaat van a naar b ik meng 1001 nacht en nescio dat kan geen enkele andere nederlandse schrijver
142910 ik moest mohammed tastbaar maken mohammed is overal maar 1 miljard moslims weten nauwelijks wie hij is hij geldt bij zijn vijanden als een rokkenjager pedofiel en racist ik wilde hem in heldere nederlandse taal tot leven wekken zoals in die zin van het belastingkantoor ik wilde mohammed tot mens maken
142911 ik was als ik in iran was gebleven een korte smalle schrijver geworden ik had niet de ruimte gehad om mezelf te ontwikkelen bij het schrijven van de adelaars kende ik dit land nog niet ik wist niet wat immigratie was ik was beschadigd maar dit zaadje werd in de vochtige grond van nederland geplant het ging groeien het werd groter en groter en het wordt een heel grote boom ik ben heel optimistisch heel optimistisch over de toekomst er is in mij een zelfbewustzijn gekomen dat er eerst niet was zelfs niet bij mijn roman spijkerschrift
142912 ik zie mijzelf als een mens ik ben een mens geworden met de nieuwsgierigheid de dromen al die dingen waardoor de mens zich onderscheidt ik had geen plan de boodschapper te schrijven maar tijdens het werk aan mijn koranvertaling ontdekte ik mohammed en dus is de mohammed uit de boodschapper voor 100 procent d ze mens kader abdolah zoals hij ook trekken zou aannemen van ieder ander die hem zou beschrijven en zoals hij over honderd jaar in een andere tijd weer anders zal worden beschreven dan nu maar mohammed is ook een oermens een universele mens een gedreven hervormer die in een barbaarse tijd leefde
142913 dit heb ik geschreven in drie jaar tijd maar er ging wel dertig jaar van lezen en studeren aan vooraf ik ken de feiten en aan die feiten heb ik niets veranderd fictie bedrijf je met behulp van die feiten niemand heeft zich ooit in mohammeds vrouw ghadidje verdiept ik wel ik ging mij inleven ik probeerde mij voor te stellen hoe mohammed naar binnen ging in haar huis en dan ging ik voor de spiegel staan en dacht ik een jonge man die een oude vrouw trouwt een vrouw met kinderen en geld hoe gaat die haar huis binnen ik ging gel in mijn haar doen parfum hier en daar ik poetste mijn schoenen en keek in de spiegel zo beschreef ik het leven van mohammed
142914 nee in iran heerst de traditie van het soefisme het zarathustra geloof wij zijn shiieten dat betekent dat er een rijke traditie is in het bestuderen van de koran van commentaren turkse of arabische schrijvers kunnen dit niet want zij zijn soennieten en in de soennitische traditie is de koran onaantastbaar en dus ook onvertaalbaar
142915 dat is de slimheid van kader abdolah wat ik zeg is honderd keer erger dan wat geert wilders beweert ik zeg dit boek is niet van allah dit boek is van mohammed maar ik heb overal ook uitgebreid gezegd dat ik mijn vertaling uit liefde en respect voor de traditie heb gemaakt wilders gebruikt lelijke woorden hij spreekt uit haat en dat wekt haat op ik denk ook dat ik geen doelwit ben omdat ik de koran help de koran ligt nu overal in nederland in de schappen naast de playboy moslimvrouwen die de koran haten omdat die gebruikt wordt om ze op te sluiten zullen deze koran misschien wel lezen hoe kunnen fanatici daar iets tegen hebben
142916 wie dat zegt liegt of is onwetend ik heb geen enkel citaat weggelaten omdat het lelijk is ik heb alleen herhalingen geschrapt wie dit zegt nodig ik nu via nrc handelsblad uit voor een debat het klopt niet wat ze zeggen ze kunnen het nooit waarmaken
142917 ik denk dat er dertig procent uit is verdwenen ik heb de doodsaaie herhalingen weggehaald zo loopt de tekst beter
142918 ik wist dat de passages over de joden gevoelig zouden liggen maar opnieuw het probleem zit in het boek de koran is vergeven van jodenhaat zonder jodenhaat zou de islam niet tot stand zijn gekomen mijn vertaling verhult dat allerminst ik heb me voor de boodschapper gebaseerd op de bronnen die ik achterin de koran noem de shi tische bronnen lang niet alle bronnen noemen de moord in medina inderdaad de passage niet opnemen is een keuze maar had ik haar wel opgenomen dan had ik weer kritiek gekregen uit joodse hoek en wat willen we bereiken met zoveel geweld ik wil de haat niet opnieuw doen opleven van meer haat gaat deze samenleving niet profiteren
142919 gelukkig wonen wij in een democratie iedereen mag zeggen wat hij wil ik vraag benali en ellian en alle anderen die mij aanvallen en ik vraag het ze met respect waar zijn jullie koranvertalingen ik zit op jullie boeken te wachten dan kunnen we de boeken vergelijken ik geef jullie twintig jaar en hoe kan men mij verwijten dat ik het nederlandse volk dom houd ik heb al die andere koranversies toch niet vernietigd iedereen die het wil kan een van de vijf andere nederlandse versies erbij pakken ik heb die boeken niet verboden ik heb ze niet verbrand ze zullen tot de conclusie komen dat kader abdolah de waarheid in zijn geheel verteld heeft een ding is duidelijk ik heb mijn boek geschreven voor meer samenhang in de samenleving we kunnen de koran van de ayatollahs hier niet gebruiken we moeten in dit land een polderkoran hebben

142944 het is vervelend dat een dispensatiespeler op de bank belandt want je denkt dat hij ons juist sterker maakt toen ik hem selecteerde wist ik nog niet hoe het met babel zou gaan ryan zou aanvankelijk ook het ek spelen maar voor het toernooi raakte hij geblesseerd ik heb er ook niet op gewacht want ik wilde snel vastigheid nu volg ik meer mijn gevoel dan verstand je moet doen wat je vindt dat je moet doen
142945 hij stond na de wedstrijd ook met zijn ploeggenoot michael bradley van sc heerenveen in de lift en die vertelde dat hij net zijn eerste wedstrijd sinds vijf weken had gespeeld sibon reageerde gevat dat dit wel eens zijn laatste in vijf weken zou kunnen zijn hij is een grote realist
142946 in de praktijk kan ik het toch anders doen want je weet niet hoe het allemaal gaat uitpakken over het middenveld ben ik nog niet helemaal uit dat ontloopt elkaar niet veel
142947 maar het was goed om nog een keer door het ritme heen te kunnen breken anders wordt het stereotiep en dat is niet goed dit was de laatste mogelijkheid want straks kan het niet meer
142948 we hebben de kwaliteit om ver te komen iedereen die meedoet heeft kans om een medaille te winnen er komt alleen wel geluk bij kijken ik hoop dat wij dat straks krijgen
142949 dan weet je dat je een beker krijgt nu krijg je een medaille er zijn nu ook andere sporters bij dus de beleving is toch wel anders maar we proberen gefocust te zijn op ons zelf dat moet je hier ook zijn
142950 het kan het juist moeilijker maken om goud te halen
142951 een topspeler zal wellicht zijn eigen spel willen spelen en minder meeverdedigen wij spelen veel compacter dat kan zeker een voordeel zijn
142952 hij moet het doen terwijl wij het samen als team gaan doen dat maakt het toch makkelijker

142969 ich hatte schon ein gewisses unbehagen weil ich so viel zeit bei den einen verbracht habe und so wenig bei den anderen
142970 wenn ich mehr zeit und mehr kraft gehabt h tte w re ich bestimmt auch mal nach donezk gefahren aber die ereignisse fesselten mich einfach an die hauptstadt
142971 es ist nicht m glich alle osteurop ischen und wom glich noch die zentralasiatischen l nder gleichzeitig im blick zu haben aber insbesondere die zeitungsh user k nnen es sich in zeiten sinkender auflagen nicht leisten berall auf der welt korrespondentenb ros zu haben f r die journalistische qualit t w re es sicherlich besser wenn die berichtsgebiete kleinteiliger w ren
142972 wir hatten damals kein richtiges gef hl daf r was in der ukrainischen gesellschaft g rt
142973 wenn man l ngere zeit nicht an einem ort ist verliert man sehr stark das gef hl daf r wie die stimmung ist ob es aggressionen gibt ob sich etwas zusammenbraut wir hatten damals kein richtiges gef hl daf r was in der ukrainischen gesellschaft g rt
142974 die ukraine kann man von moskau aus immer nur punktuell bearbeiten
142975 die logik der ukrainischen politik ist eigentlich nur aus kiew oder aus der ukraine selbst zu verstehen
142976 es kann durchaus sein dass die heimatredaktion diese voraussagen des razumkow instituts in meinen text eingef gt hat genauso gut ist es m glich dass ich noch ein zweites institut zitiert habe und die redaktion das wieder herausgestrichen hat
142977 als freier journalist erlebt man dass redaktionen texte mitunter ziemlich freiz gig redigieren
142978 die eine zeitung schreibt in meinen text noch ein paar worte oder einen absatz hinein damit er f r sie druckbar wird die andere zeitung nimmt einige worte oder abs tze raus damit er in ihr russlandbild passt
142979 es ist mittlerweile so dass das fernsehen fast ausschlie lich auf ukrainisch sendet
142980 durch eine bestimmte politische voreinstellung zeigen korrespondenten nicht immer das ganze bild sondern nur einen ausschnitt
142981 wenn putin seine bomber testet reagieren die westlichen medien fast kollektiv sehr scharf russland geb rde sich aggressiv hei t es dann oft wird dabei ausgeblendet dass sich russland durch den plan der amerikanischen raketenabwehr in osteuropa provoziert f hlt
142982 durch eine bestimmte politische voreinstellung zeigen korrespondenten nicht immer das ganze bild sondern nur einen ausschnitt
142983 als westlichem korrespondenten gef llt einem die vorstellung von einer demokratisierten ukraine die ein verl sslicher stlicher partner europas ist nat rlich besser
142984 die vereinigten staaten sind mit sicherheit eine hilfreichere gr e in der internationalen politik als russland
142985 uneigenn tzig war die unterst tzung der usa nicht sie hatte letztlich einen regimewechsel zum ziel insofern h tte man russland und die usa bei diesem thema journalistisch gleich behandeln m ssen auch uns ist das damals nicht ganz gelungen
142986 betrachtet sich der journalist als f hrer schn ffler entlarver kreuzfahrer oder als gewissenhafter spiegel vorherrschender tatsachen und meinungen als autorisierter sprecher einer bestimmten untergruppe als durchschnittlicher b rger der die ihm von seinem arbeitgeber bertragene aufgabe erledigt als unentdecktes talent das von feindschaft umgeben ist oder als kluger drahtzieher der ffentlichen leichtgl ubigkeit
142987 ich denke journalismus ist in gewisser weise politik denn wenn man unter politik versteht auf die gesellschaft einfluss zu nehmen indem man bestimmte vorg nge kritisiert dann macht man auch als journalist politik

142997 der liebe gott hat uns immer geholfen und hilft uns immer er hat uns diese kinder geschenkt und hilft uns sie gro zu ziehen solange es gottes wille ist dass wir kinder haben freuen wir uns ber nachwuchs
142998 die kinder sehr sch n sind brav und wohl erzogen sie sind sehr interessiert und offen f r neues folgen den anweisungen am set und arbeiten gut mit anderen kindern zusammen
142999 in einem werbespot ber gewalt gegen kinder sollten wir die entwicklung eines jungen zeigen von klein auf bis zum erwachsenwerden so dass wir mit drei jungen der familie zainea gearbeitet haben

143008 auf der einen seite steht der zweimal vorbestrafte ministerpr sident viktor janukowitsch ein mann mit dem charme eines vorschlaghammers ein apparatschik vom alten schlag und der mann der alten korrupten macht elite auf der anderen seite oppositionskandidat viktor juschtschenko der sich als reform premier einen namen gemacht hat er gilt als moderner politiker westlichen zuschnitts
143009 in einem handschriftlichen dokument in hundert w rtern ein dutzend rechtschreibfehler

143017 es geht um die existenzielle frage ob das land f r die n chsten jahre vollends im dunstkreis russlands verschwindet oder sich endlich auf den weg nach westen macht

143021 janukowitsch war in sewerodonezk anwesend und hatte die stimmung angeheizt die ukraine stehe nur noch einen schritt vor dem abgrund
143022 vor allem mit der drohung das land zu spalten hat sich janukowitsch als verhandlungspartner aus dem spiel geworfen
143023 zwei wochen sp ter zerplatzte die drohung janukowitschs wie eine luftblase im russlandorientierten osten blieb alles leise als der sieg des pro westlichen oppositions f hrers viktor juschtschenko am montag de facto feststand ob einsicht hinter dem kurswechsel steckt ist fraglich volkszorn sei im osten nur gegen bares zu entfachen und genau das fehle janukowitsch hie es in kiewer regierungskreisen

143027 der nat rliche feind der hethiter und damit auch der trojaner waren die griechen
143028 in den bewohnern der mittelmeerinseln oder anatoliens stiegen wenn sie den vogelschnabel auf dem vordersteven einer griechischen galeere sichteten wohl hnliche gef hle auf wie in den angelsachsen wenn der drachenkopf am vordersteven eines wikingerschiffes vor der hafeneinfahrt auftauchte
143029 kriegsgrund war die entf hrung der sch nen helena k nigin von sparta durch den trojanischen prinzen paris sowie der verlust des staatsschatzes den die beiden auf der flucht mitnahmen die griechen landeten vor troja und forderten die r ckgabe des staatsschatzes und der k nigin helena an ihren ehemann spartas k nig menelaos doch die trojaner verweigerten sich dieser forderung in den n chsten neun kriegsjahren verw steten und pl nderten die griechen das umland von troja und die inseln vor der k ste aber an die stadt selbst kamen sie nicht heran ironischerweise konzentriert sich die ilias auf nahk mpfe auf der trojanischen ebene obwohl doch der gro teil des krieges anderswo ausgefochten wurde und vor allem aus raubz gen bestand zudem beschr nkt sich die ilias auf nur zwei monate im neunten jahr des langen konfliktes
143030 es gab keine belagerung trojas die griechen waren unterlegen und konnten troja nur durch einen trick einnehmen dieser trick k nnte durchaus das trojanische pferd gewesen sein
143031 die ilias ist ein boxkampf um die meisterschaft ausgetragen bei bester sicht zur mittagszeit und mit einem k o schlag als kr nendem abschluss der trojanische krieg bestand aus tausend einzelnen wrestling k mpfen die im dunkeln ausgetragen wurden und nur dadurch zu gewinnen waren dass man dem gegner ein bein stellte
143032 hier fanden die schnellz ngigen trojaner wahrscheinlich wege andere zu t uschen und zu betr gen die weit ber das hinausgingen was man sich in theben oder mykene so vorstellen konnte
143033 westanatolien nahm w hrend der sp ten bronzezeit eine hnliche stellung ein wie polen im 20 jahrhundert

143079 pogingen ondermijnt om hem en anderen voor het gerecht te brengen
143080 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
143081 the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him stabbing him stabbing him in the chest area
143082 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
143083 if you could reduce these sensational attacks further i think you are almost approaching a level of normal or latent violence
143084 the fact that the levels of violence have come down so significantly and stayed down now for some two and a half months indicates there is a degree of durability
143085 agreement will serve as the foundation for americas presence in iraq
143086 fuck you well stop using the shit if its gonna cost so much
143087 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
143088 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that

143103 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
143104 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
143105 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
143106 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
143107 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
143108 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
143109 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
143110 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
143111 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
143112 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
143113 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
143114 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
143115 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
143116 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
143117 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
143118 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
143119 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical its a very different type of system
143120 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
143121 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
143122 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
143123 7 key or a combination of a few different numbers heck maybe even have a special key just for the dial out after all at least half of the buttons on this monstrous phone have meanings or functions completely unknown and therefore unused to me anything but the first two thirds of that most perilously dialed number in existence

143131 if i were giving a last lecture id admonish the listeners to stop pretending to the extent possible that they are going to live forever it is a necessary myth for ones morale but the otherwise reality ought to be factored in to decisions about what to do during a limited time span on this planet id also tell them that in the end nobody really cares what you do or dont do and that your obligation is to after measuring the pros and cons do with your limited time those things that most please you
143132 as i read pauschs book i thought about that i might say in a last lecture there would be all kinds of advice but the most important message i think i would try to convey is to find your passion and then convert it into a career too many people live lives of quiet desperation thats because they spend most of their time doing things that dont excite their hearts minds and souls finding those things that do no matter what the pay scale will lead i think to an exciting invigorating and satisfying life
143133 before you go off to the wild blue yonder somewhere id like to tell you the secret of success well its not a secret anymore because im going to tell you
143134 were i to give such a lecture which most likely i never would it would focus on the interplay of forces that i encountered early in my career
143135 the vital role early on of senior behavioral science mentors who spotted some potential in me and paved the way for me
143136 a growing passion for certain kinds of understanding of psychological measurement problems that led to some discoveries about long standing problems the most recent being earlier this year
143137 and the fleeting elation of discovery quickly replaced by new quanderies maybe to help keep the mind from atrophying completely
143138 many nights such as tonight september 23 1959 i lie awake and think about my mother always i start to cry and my thoughts trace back to the days when she was alive and ill she would be watching tv and ask and ask me to come sit by her im busy now was my usual reply
143139 other times she would be in my room and we would get in fights because she wouldnt leave oh how i hate myself for that with a little bit of kindness from her only daughter she might have been so much happier why wasnt i nicer to my mother whom i loved and love more than anyone else in the world why wasnt i
143140 i had a student this quarter that got two ds and a f when she previously took the organic chemistry class i teach i saw down with her at the beginning of the quarter and mapped out a different way of approach the class study habits and thinking about molecules she earned an a this quarter from an organic chemistry course considered the barrier to medical and other professional schools where only 15 percent receive as this is an amazing performance the incident showed me that with a few small suggestions i can completely alter the course of someones life
143141 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well

143153 we have a lot of long term business in that sector but clearly we are benefiting from current operations in iraq and afghanistan
143154 but the lacklustre top line performance coupled with the overhang of the doj u s department of justice investigation is likely to somewhat offset the increased guidance
143155 we see those three in particular as markets wed like to add to our home market list

143159 no doubt the jobs data will generate a host of opinions but the market is likely waiting for a surprise whether be it an upside or a downside as the next catalyst
143160 upstream businesses have benefited from higher gas prices which have been driven up by record world oil prices

143237 shell be a teen who will set boundaries deconstruct all the mixed messages she will be presented with and make choices she is truly comfortable with she will not allow her sexuality to be shaped by misogynist music plastic paris wannabe dolls or the contemporary media environment that would have her believe that everyone is up for anything all the time and that to be hot she will have to get more make up and less clothes shell grow up on her own terms that is my wish for her thats my wish for all girls that is what i will continue working towards
143238 we dont need to change our bodies we need to change the rules

143240 it is always okay to say no no im too hot no im too cold no im not feeling well no i have a cold sore coming on etc etc etc
143241 we dont need to change our bodies we need to change the rules
143242 the consequences of the sexualisation of girls in media today are very real
143243 we have ample evidence to conclude that sexualisation has negative effects in a variety of domains including cognitive functioning physical and mental health and healthy sexual development
143244 school uniforms may well titillate pedophiles and prompt them to commit crimes but is banning school uniforms the correct response

143254 we dont need to change our bodies we need to change the rules
143255 that children are certainly more visibly sexualised in terms of the media to which they are exposed this basic assumption was not challenged by any evidence received and is based on recognition of the increasing targeting of products to child related markets and the greater exposure of children to information via the many available media forms and particularly the internet however it would be a mistake to equate these influences with actual harm
143256 the recommendations amount to nothing more than a polite request that advertisers and broadcasters might perhaps if its not too much trouble consider listening to community concerns a little more

143264 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
143265 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
143266 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
143267 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
143268 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
143269 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
143270 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
143271 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
143272 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
143273 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
143274 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
143275 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
143276 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
143277 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
143278 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
143279 if theres contamination you always reswab and you would remember doing it
143280 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
143281 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
143282 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
143283 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
143284 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
143285 name redacted has been very supportive but there is not much interest from others in the headquarters in enforcing safety problems
143286 for example i went into a virology suite one day
143287 he no name specified went through the hot change room stark naked carrying two library books and a bottle of pepsi i went in through the change room and found him sitting in the office drinking the pepsi and wearing scrubs
143288 i informed the individual that the pepsi and the books from frederick county library should not have come in through the hot area but only through the passbox also the library books would need to be autoclaved out of the suite
143289 the researcher didnt think these issues were important so i addressed it with name redacted and he or she addressed it with the supervisor
143290 there was minimal support from the supervisor and division chief in general the virology division chief does not support safety concerns
143291 i think theres a serious problem i recommend to my people to always wear one pair of gloves and to remove the outer pair of gloves after working with agent since i cant be sure the lab isnt contaminated
143292 there is institutional skepticism and a feeling that the safety program may be more about insulating the institute from criticism than from protecting the workers
143293 other workers have mentioned they might not report in the future because of the fallout from this episode
143294 one thing you really want to avoid is if you find a safety violation you want to make sure there is an openness and acceptance about not being too punitive
143295 you want to make people feel that they are openly contributing in a way that is not going to shut down their inclination to say hey this happened

143310 the world is doing far more than ever before to fight aids
143311 literally came in in wheelbarrows a common form of ambulance in lusaka
143312 getting patients to come in before they are deathly ill
143313 we are very concerned it is alarming because polio does not respect borders as long as the polio virus is present in any one country it can spread to the rest of the world the potential ramifications of this are quite serious
143314 india is now responsible for most of the exported cases of the virus in the world today five countries have major outbreaks of polio and all those countries were infected by the indian virus
143315 the fear is that with the large amount of travel from india that the disease will spread further
143316 it would be tragic to see the world reinfected from india because we were unable to finish the job in such a small area
143317 the region is a polio factory and always has been
143318 my experience is that there is a lot of frustration
143319 people live really grim lives here and they get angry when officials come back to their house every six weeks with a polio vaccine when what they really want is electricity water sanitation and better health care
143320 but some people are still misinformed and believe for example that the vaccine may cause impotence so they decide not to vaccinate their children we have to tackle this
143321 according to the model projections gdp at 2002 03 prices would decline in 2015 16 by rupees 11 097 93 billion
143322 it is possible to argue that in the next decade the annual gdp growth rate can be increased by up to 1 percent if aids is effectively countered

143591 all in all chinas security forces are confident and capable of securing the olympic games

143610 it is very good for the team to have a player who can get in between the oppositions midfield and defence and score goals
143611 the tactical lay out of the team and whether or not we are going to play two up front is down to rafa benitez

144008 todas las organizaciones mapuche y sociales deben sumarse a esta justa y noble causa
144009 en todo momento estamos abiertos al di logo y si lo hubi ramos hecho cortado di logo y ser violentos no se hubiera hecho presente la intendenta a las 2 de la ma ana en el mismo recinto ocupado lo que dice la conadi es una gran falsedad
144010 todas las organizaciones mapuche y sociales deben sumarse a esta justa y noble causa
144011 injustificada la actitud del gobierno que no da posibilidad de di logo
144012 cabe recordar que dicha acusaci n corresponde a la formulada por el ex director de conadi jaime andrade qui n habr a concurrido a participar de una reuni n en la comunidad el d a 29 de agosto del 2006 informando posteriormente por medio de una conferencia de prensa que habr a sido objeto de agresiones por parte de nuestra gente

144015 alg n d a todo el odio y la violencia ir n de vuelta entonces comenzar a brillar el sol de la justicia mapuche
144016 tengo la sensaci n de haber hecho todo lo posible y haberlo hecho bien en el fallo el tribunal le dio validez a la presunci n de inocencia que en los casos mapuches ha sido muy pocas veces respetada y ahora espero que ese fallo sea respetado

144019 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n

144024 el gobierno no tiene una pol tica real para cambiar la realidad de los m s necesitados y mucho menos para los pueblos ind genas
144025 fueron masacradas en las mismas tierras que hoy son utilizadas para el monocultivo de soja

144043 mark in hockenheim hattest du deinen ersten technischen defekt des jahres und dabei hat noch nicht einmal dein auto versagt bist du damit zufrieden
144044 so weit so gut ich war regelrecht berrascht davon rauch am heck des autos sehen zu m ssen denn wir haben schon eine ganze zeit lang nicht mehr auf der strecke anhalten m ssen ich habe wohl ein paar bruchst cke von timo glocks auto mitgenommen was den lk hler sofort besch digt hat
144045 ich war da nicht n her dabei und bin die ganze zeit voll auf dem gas geblieben denn ich wusste ja dass er zu meiner rechten und ein ganzes st ck entfernt war bei seinem ersten einschlag hatte ich dann aber jede menge tr mmerteile vor mit denn die lagen auf der ganzen strecke verstreut und die konnte ich nicht verfehlen
144046 dabei hatte ich wohl etwas pech habe mir deswegen allerdings keine gedanken gemacht als ich in monaco durch die berreste von nico rosbergs wagen gefahren bin dachte ich schon dass ich mir etwas eingefangen h tte denn da war die ausgangslage eine ganz andere aber egal wichtig ist doch dass timo nichts passiert ist die hauptsache ist ganz klar keine verletzungen davonzutragen
144047 du warst vor allem in silverstone besonders stark der hungaroring ist dagegen eine vollkommen andere strecke kannst du auf einer langsamen strecke ebenfalls gut aussehen
144048 das will ich doch hoffen das auto war bislang auf jedem kurs recht schnell hockenheim einmal ausgenommen dort hatten wir probleme vor allem im zweiten abschnitt einiges lag daran dass es uns etwas an pferdest rken mangelt wir bauen einfach darauf dass uns die vielen kurven hier entgegenkommen
144049 monaco halte ich hingegen f r das wochenende wo wir am wenigsten konkurrenzf hig waren obwohl ich dort ein gutes resultat einfahren konnte weil es ein ganz andersartiges rennen war
144050 renault stellt die fl gel gerne etwas flacher ein was ihnen im rennen zugute kommen soll macht ihr das auch so
144051 ja man muss schon sicherstellen dass man im rennen einen gewissen schutz hat das macht es am sonntag meistens etwas schwieriger denn man nimmt die reifen im grand prix deutlich h rter ran aber power kann man ohnehin nie genug haben
144052 wie sehr hast du dich beim testen schon mit der aerodynamik f r 2009 auseinandergesetzt
144053 ich habe in jerez einen ganzen tag lang damit verbracht f r uns war das sehr produktiv denn wir konnten sehr viele erkenntnisse sammeln und viele runden auf slicks zur cklegen eine menge teams zerbrechen sich noch immer ihre k pfe wie sie ihre aerodynamik zur ckbauen sollen und wie das ganze dann funktionieren wird
144054 das ist aber vollkommen normal wenn sich die regeln ndern in melbourne werden alle klar sehen bei uns lief es relativ glatt wir lernen noch immer ber die slicks dazu weil wir in diesem prozess noch am anfang stehen sie sind aber komplett nutzbar die entscheidung die reifenw rmer zu behalten war wirklich gut
144055 was f r ein gef hl hast du f r das kommende jahr
144056 alle werden recht schnell sein denke ich die autos werden jedenfalls wohl kaum langsamer sein so viel steht fest meiner meinung nach werden wir schneller sein als 2008 vor allem mit kers ich glaube dass alle schnellere autos haben werden
144057 keine ahnung da kannst du momentan wohl blo eine m nze werfen um zu sehen wo die teams stehen so wie es im moment aussieht werden acht von zehn teams in punkto kers mit magneti marelli zusammenarbeiten mclaren mercedes und bmw werden ihr eigenes s ppchen kochen auf der einen seite gibt es dann kers auf der anderen seite verfolgen manche teams unterschiedliche programme um zu sehen ob ein kers auto in melbourne siegf hig w re
144058 nat rlich gibt es auch eine reihe von leuten welche die einf hrung des systems gerne um eine saison verschieben w rden seit der ank ndigung dieser regel nderung haben sie darauf hingearbeitet das sind aber gro e worte zumal wir schon mittendrin in den vorbereitungen stehen einige teams geben etwa 60 millionen euro f r kers aus und das sind ziemlich gro e ausgaben
144059 wie sehr freust du dich auf das kommende jahr jetzt da ihr um den vierten konstrukteursrang mitfahrt w rdest du das gerne so beibehalten
144060 f r uns w re es nat rlich besser wenn wir dabei bleiben k nnten aber das wird nicht passieren ich bin nicht sonderlich begeistert von kers die regel nderungen an sich sind schon okay um auf die lage der teams zu sprechen zu kommen so haben wir red bull in diesem jahr richtig viel zu verdanken
144061 wir haben durch unsere zuverl ssigkeit schon eine menge kritiker verstummen lassen wir sind rausgefahren haben eine solide leistung gezeigt und m ssen uns daf r keinesfalls entschuldigen wir haben noch acht rennen vor uns und m ssen damit weitermachen das team kann aber schon jetzt sehr zufrieden sein wir machen ziemlich viel richtig und die rennen waren in diesem jahr offensichtlich recht gut f r uns
144062 meiner meinung nach werden die grand prix in der kommenden saison weitaus unterschiedlicher ablaufen denn die leute m ssen sich erst noch an die neuen regeln gew hnen sonderlich spektakul r wird das zun chst wohl nicht sein immer wenn du die regeln nderst dann werden das einige teams falsch und andere wiederum richtig machen
144063 man muss sich nur einmal die vergangenen 30 rennen ansehen und wie sehr die startaufstellung auseinander gezogen war daran sieht man ganz klar dass viele gute entscheidungen getroffen wurden vielleicht ist dieser gro e einschnitt also eine gute sache ich w nsche den kommentatoren schon jetzt viel vergn gen dabei das alles zu erkl ren was in einem grand prix des jahres 2009 so alles vorgeht
144064 f r uns w re das eine ganz gro e sache wenn wir den vierten platz zur ckerobern und halten k nnten das ist eine schwierige aufgabe aber nicht unm glich wir liegen nur einen punkt zur ck wir brauchen daf r aber zwei autos nur so kann das klappen glock ist schnell unterwegs wenn er einen guten tag hat und nelson nelson piquet anm d red hat k rzlich acht punkte geholt
144065 david david coulthard anm d red und ich m ssen uns an jedem der noch verbleibenden wochenenden hinter den beiden bmws positionieren was die r nge sieben und acht bedeuteten w rde k nnen wir das packen dann wird es klappen aber das ist viel leichter gesagt als getan
144066 wie hoch ist der druck dabei zumal es zwischen dem vierten und dem sechsten rang bei den konstrukteuren doch einen finanziellen unterschied bei den preisgeldern gibt
144067 the current environment is not particularly intriguing its more challenging to make a deal and explain it to our shareholders
144068 despite the likelihood that the rumors contributed to the fall in the share price the fsa has not uncovered evidence that they were spread as part of a concerted attempt by individuals to profit by manipulating the share price
144069 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumors were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hbos share price
144070 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day

144088 the feeling that you get when you know that your children are dead and then that you are the one accused of their murder is indescribable
144089 i sat with my children for around two hours and cried and cried
144090 i have never felt so bad in all my life
144091 we had a passionate relationship for around four or five days we were good together
144092 when i looked at the accused i broke down completely because i recognized her as the woman who stood outside my door
144093 one can question whether she has any memory from the time of the murder or whether she is backing up her memory from her reflections
144094 if one thinks for enough time about something it starts to feel familiar and ultimately becomes a autobiographical memory

144178 we have atheists and satanists getting the bibles 10 commandments removed from public property yet the satanic georgia guidestones have stood for decades and nobody seems to care well we do
144179 in mezzo alle frattaglie di mondo che quotidianamente passano da l mi attirava la fragilit della cosa come scrivere allo scoperto in piedi su un torrione tutti che ti guardano e il vento che tira tutti che passano pieni di cose da fare e tu l senza poter correggere tornare indietro ridisegnare la scaletta come viene viene
144180 dovendo riassumere direi questo tutti a sentire nellaria unincomprensibile apocalisse imminente e ovunque questa voce che corre stanno arrivando i barbari vedi menti raffinate scrutare larrivo dellinvasione con gli occhi fissi nellorizzonte della televisione professori capaci dalle loro cattedre misurano nei silenzi dei loro allievi le rovine che si lasciato dietro il passaggio di unorda che in effetti nessuno per riuscito a vedere e intorno a quel che si scrive o si immagina aleggia lo sguardo smarrito di esegeti che sgomenti raccontano una terra saccheggiata da predatori senza cultura i barbari eccoli qua ora nel mio mondo scarseggia lonest intellettuale ma non lintelligenza non sono tutti ammattiti vedono qualcosa che c ma quel che c io non riesco a guardarlo con quegli occhi l qualcosa non mi torna
144181 its flapping its tail and moving its head so its still with us its a case of waiting until the tide rises to hopefully get it back into the water
144182 as the tide comes in it lifts the whole contraption up which gives us control of the whale
144183 it has been in the area for a couple of days which is not good it means it will be already dehydrated and very very hungry
144184 its a northern bottlenose whale like the one in the thames so it wont have eaten for a couple of days because theres no squid and it feeds on squid in the deep water
144185 its very very unusual we have had seals before but never a whale
144186 the best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago the second best time is now
144187 we have an excellent history of breeding wildcat kittens at the highland wildlife park
144188 these latest litters have been quite shy and have only started coming out of their box in the last few days
144189 they are really playful and are proving to be very popular with our visitors

144191 i dont know where this guy comes from but this thing he calls manny being manny what the bleep does that mean whatever it doesnt work in this mans army this young mans problems started with the haircut and grew from there
144192 im tired of the army and the armys tired of me
144193 i dont care i can even play in boston if need be
144194 i think you almost have nba teams being overly cautious at this point
144195 with so many teams so close to the luxury tax teams are unwilling to take risks krstic was a risk a small one but a risk we are certainly seeing the effects of the collective bargaining agreement this year but these things are cyclical if lots of team had cap room childress krstic and others would be playing in the nba

144197 she just had a maggie lucas night i think shes one of the best shooters in the country and tonight she showed it she got some open looks she pulled the trigger and she came through for us in a big way
144198 i became more confident coming off the bench as the season went on and i realized thats what they wanted from me ive just got to hit off the bench amp it used to be harder but ive kind of gotten used to it
144199 now im not the smartest coach in the world but ive had mcdonalds all americans come off the bench before
144200 i try to balance out my two teams as best i can so we dont lose anything when were going in and out
144201 responsibility for everything she does out on the court offensively and defensively
144202 we beat a great team but weve still got a lot of games to win
144203 i got tired of getting my teeth kicked in every weekend doing it the way i was doing it
144204 i dont want to go to the track to be 20th i have better things to do with my time than that when i dont run good i carry my feelings on my shoulder and im not a very fun guy to be around
144205 if i want to become relevant again its on me
144206 i drove my way instead of taking what the car was giving me that hurt me a lot ive changed the way i feel with the seat of my pants the small things i can do to help my crew chief understand what the cars doing
144207 some people change the way they hit a golf ball sometimes change their swing a little bit
144208 i went from being stubborn about my driving style to changing and adapting better ive had to change my whole way of thinking
144209 thats definitely the best run ive ever had at gillett evernham
144210 the biggest thing you go through as a driver is with the new car what does it like we were struggling so much with that last year kasey and me both questioned ourselves are we doing this right have we lost it and this year started that way too
144211 yep thats where it happened thats where it all began to click
144212 we found out what that car needed from us and weve been fast ever since
144213 the coolest thing about it is we went to indy where theres so much prestige and everybody carries their best stuff best car best motor and we were able to be that good
144214 i dont like passing the buck im not that kind of person
144215 i looked in the mirror and asked what do i have to do to get better its on me its working and were not done yet
144216 i think we do have a chip on our shoulder
144217 you read the papers we have no chance even in the nfc east
144218 i dont mind going under the radar if were not the team to beat or were not expected to be the best team it doesnt bother me this team knows what we accomplished last year and what we did last year we didnt always play our best football until the playoffs now we have to work on being more consistent and play on a high level week in and week out
144219 the goal right now is to correct the mistakes we made this morning talk about the stuff we are going to install this afternoon and go out there and work on that we are going to try to have another good practice and string them together our focus right now is very short term
144220 i think part of what helps you move forward is to say ok we did the best we could do and it didnt turn out the way we would have liked but sometimes that happens
144221 we are moving forward with just as much energy and excitement as we always have hopefully we can go out there and put ourselves in the best position possible every week
144222 can we harness what we did in the playoffs and extend it throughout the whole season
144223 we know we have the pieces in place and we know we are missing a few of them but i think the majority of them are still here i think that if we can find a way to bring back get our mojo back so to speak and start another run
144224 we start by taking leadership from our head coach and the example that he sets
144225 i dont think he is too concerned with what anybody did last year including us he is concerned with what we did today and what we do tomorrow that is where is all starts i dont think what any team has done in the history of the nfl will have any effect on what we do this year we are going to do the best we can do we are going to try and do the best we can do everyday in practice hopefully that leads to a lot of wins
144226 i told him earlier this week that im getting up there in age and i dont eat or drink all day long during competition
144227 that really takes its toll by the end of the week im so drained i can hardly hold my head up
144228 he put that bag of food in there and i told my co angler partner every day you make sure you make me eat even my espn cameraman wes miller today he was pulling the food out and making me eat
144229 i felt so great all day this week hoover really proved his point
144230 the only thing i can figure and this is just a guess is that youre not into it mentally
144231 were finding out its a lot more mental than everybody thinks it is
144232 the first day of a tournament i generally have a pretty high number if i have a good day the next day i fish a little more relaxed and his total heartbeat count is lower
144233 im catching the same number of fish but mentally im not as keyed up
144234 my numbers will usually go up on the third and fourth days
144235 ive learned a lot about what ive always been feeling
144236 i understand what it is now i try to really key on the nutrition end of it i try to eat a little bit throughout the course of the day
144237 i feel a lot better i have more energy i sleep better
144238 this has really opened my eyes to the fact that this is a physical sport its a lot more physical than i ever thought it was
144239 i just took it for granted that i was tired at the end of the day because i got up early fished hard all day and was up late the night before i didnt realize that just taking time for some proper nutrition was going to change the way i felt at the end of the week
144240 i want to make sure ive got a full tank so i can get to the end of the race if youre out of gas by noon and youve still got three hours to fish its not helping you put any money in your pocket
144241 i felt so great all day this week he really proved his point
144242 it always seems like theres a time we go through a four minute stretch in the second half when we cant do anything
144243 we like to pull our posts out from the basket a little because they have more space
144244 we were really looking forward to the opportunity of playing them
144245 theyre the no 1 team in the country coming into this game so we had nothing to lose and nobody expected us to win this game
144246 we couldnt run any of our sets to the inside because of griner
144247 we knew they liked to do the high pick and rolls they do a lot of nba stuff a lot of one one one
144248 with griner we let her catch the basketball and then doubled down on her
144249 we knew if we fronted her theyd just lob it over
144250 i think my guards got excited when we got behind trying to do too much
144251 in the past when they tried to do too much it worked out for us so it may have been fools gold
144252 we tried to keep sims out of the middle but that didnt work
144253 shes too good to keep out of the middle shes impossible to stop from coming in the lane
144254 this failure by the department of health is a perfect illustration of the crazy method of budgeting and performance evaluation fostered by fianna f il during its 11 years in government
144255 it drafts high rhetoric strategies which are weak on specific targets or policy tools
144256 we were behind darlaston town hall when myself and my wife were knocked flying off our feet by this massive dog
144257 it grabbed our little westie by its neck and started to shake it from side to side i grabbed this dogs jaws to prise out my dog and it bit my face and hands
144258 it grabbed my dog a second time but went for its sides i grabbed it again but this dog was very powerful i had to get my legs around it because it was strong
144259 i managed to pull tuppy out of its jaws again but it kept trying to to get at her there was blood everywhere
144260 our little dog ran away and debbie found her in an alley
144261 a little boy then came up to me with tuppys lead he must have seen what had happened because he was sobbing his eyes out

144267 my parents are apprehensive about the trip but i think my fiance catherine is the worst i think shes going to miss me a lot im not too worried about being away over christmas and new year as it will be very easy to get in touch with people back home
144268 every week were given half an hour free use of the phones and the royal mail are very helpful allowing letters to be sent out to us for free my job out there is maintaining the communications from the front line out to bastion and then back to hq in kandahar i do hope we are making a difference out there and that we are improving things for the people of afghanistan
144269 i have been with the ta for a long time 22 years but this is my first time in afghanistan
144270 i know it is going to be a very busy job but at the same time it is so important to keep the communications infrastructure in place if the army doesnt communicate then it doesnt work
144271 we are going out in support of nato and the international security assistance force isas
144272 some of our aims while we are out there include defeating the taliban and training and enabling the afghan army soldiers will be dealing with a range of terrains from mountains which are six thousand ft above sea level to expanses of desert at the moment it is 55 degrees c out there but it will start to get colder especially over christmas

144283 has rising inflationary pressure passed its peak or are tough times still ahead
144284 that is the highest we have seen for some time
144285 the last time we saw an increase like this was in 2002
144286 certainly the global environment is a big factor in this
144287 if one looks at many other economies round the world they are also experiencing record inflation levels
144288 a key factor has been oil prices which averaged 55 a barrel in january 2007 and then rose to more than 130 a barrel
144289 most economists did not foresee these very strong increases in fuel and food
144290 when people say the reserve bank should increase the interest rate it is code language for saying the reserve bank should increase the money supply

144296 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
144297 we should also protect the player and if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
144298 because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club im always in favour to protect the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
144299 we have nothing to say fifa is not going to intervene let it be as it is now
144300 and given the way the market is at present responding very quickly to bad news it is likely to spark share selling

144312 i would like to go for a collagen or boot injection or facial surgery but i am scared of anesthesia i have heard so many people who have done it and look so good its an advantage to do plastic surgery maybe i should ask koena what to do

144317 ive been upset and i mustve said it they wanted rakhi for the item song in the first place they brought me in because they wanted to make it different they shouldve gone ahead with her

144325 the challenges at hand are tough enough they have been made severe by the fact that there is no government in islamabad at the moment parliament does not function coalition partners are threatening each other and even within ppp there seems to be rebellion in the making these are not good signs for any government let alone a government in crisis the u s frustration is even more amusing as their entire investment is now threatened we have no hesitation in saying that the present regime under zardari and ppp with anp and mqm as the coalition partners are the most incompetent corrupt and perhaps dangerous group of suspects to lead the country at this juncture already the seeds of a violent social disintegration are being planted rapidly as if the handlers of this government know that they have only a few more weeks to complete the job and are in a hurry the previous government led by pml q under the guidance of musharraf and premiership of shaukat was perhaps considered as the worst in 60 years history of pakistan despite its completion of five years in terms of internal security economic corruption and social division and unrest this present government led by zardari is already on way to surpassing that record in a short span of 3 months

144468 non cera nessuno ho visto del caff ancora fumante monitor spenti ho ricevuto una chiamata da uno dei miei superiori
144469 c stato questo suono da brivido lintero edificio si oscurato e la rampa di scale su cui stavo ha ceduto
144470 coinvolto in una decisione di abbattere ledificio ma chiss cosa voleva dire sono solo ipotesi
144471 solo due mesi prima dell11 9 larry silverstein sottoscrisse una polizza assicurativa da 3 5 miliardi di dollari sulle torri gemelle che prevedeva un risarcimento in caso di attacco terroristico
144472 non si dice prendemmo la decisione di pull it che si riferisce a una cosa
144473 la decisione pi grave fu quella di definire una zona di evacuazione intorno al 7 e di tirare via tutti
144474 noi non abbiamo bisogno di chiedere il permesso al proprietario no quando prendiamo in carico un edificio lo prendiamo in carico e quella decisione spetta al comandante dei pompieri e soltanto a lui per questo so che non esiste nessun complotto perch farne parte io sarebbe osceno e mi disgusta persino pensarlo
144475 la pi grande struttura in acciaio che abbiamo demolito e credo sia ancora un record nel guinness lhudson building di detroit
144476 ci vollero mesi per progettarlo ci vollero mesi per preparare la struttura per la collocazione delle cariche esplosive mesi si fa un sacco di rumore non lo si pu evitare si abbattono di solito tutte le pareti ai piani dove si collocano gli esplosivi
144477 in una sceneggiatura in un film qualcosa con bruce willis magari nella realt no
144478 e possibile che gli esplosivi siano stati collocati prima della ristrutturazione di ogni piano o durante la costruzione iniziale delledificio
144479 davvero non so che dire questi esplosivi hanno una data di scadenza quelli fatti in questo paese dicono da usare entro tre anni altrimenti non ci si pu fidare che esplodano

144483 er hat einen fehler gemacht aber eine volkspartei braucht starke charaktere auch auf den fl geln wahlen gewinnen wir nur gemeinsam clement geh rt genauso zur spd wie andrea nahles und hermann scheer
144484 allerdings wird die kommission auch die politische biografie eines sozialdemokraten zu w rdigen haben der spd landesvorsitzender war der ministerpr sident war und der nicht gez gert hat dem ruf nach berlin als bundesminister zu folgen
144485 die aufregung um seinen m glichen parteiausschluss schadet eher der spd
144486 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist wer sich so unsolidarisch verh lt muss mit einer solchen entscheidung rechnen
144487 wolfgang clement betreibt ein ablenkungsman ver wenn er sich auf die meinungsfreiheit beruft
144488 mit seinem namen und seiner reputation als ehemaliger spd vize und bundesminister hat clement eine woche vor einer landtagswahl dazu aufgerufen nicht die spd zu w hlen
144489 aufgabe des schiedsgerichts ist es nicht politische berzeugungen zu beurteilen sondern verhalten
144490 wir vertrauen auf die bundesschiedskommission die wird eine kluge entscheidung treffen

144495 it is your hair pick out the color that you feel best with and you feel most comfortable in
144496 i like the brown but i just do not feel as sexy as a brunette as i do when i am a blonde
144497 i really do think you have to have strong facial features to pull off being a brunette otherwise you are just another face in the crowd

144527 apple almost never announces a product in advance of shipment
144528 its starting to look like apple is getting deperate and theyre announcing things before theyre ready for market
144529 theyre on a cycle time that runs on months not years

144531 i would argue the iphone is bigger for cingular than it is for apple
144532 cingular stores will use it for store traffic but once a person gets in there theyll down sell it the biggest advantage is it will drive store traffic into cingular

144602 highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours
144603 the other reason i think is a big factor is the simplicity of consoles compared to pcs this is something that has many pc gamers turning to consoles with a pc game you have to install it before you can do anything and thats if you can even run the game as we all know different games require different things to run them this just means that pc gamers have to constantly be upgrading their pcs if they wish to play the latest games a console gamer only has to put the game in and away they go there is never the issue of whether something will run on your machine
144604 yes as of late with msg4 resistance 2 and killzone 2 the developers hard work are starting to pay off for the better especially with msg4 which even many xbox360 gamers can appreciate and respect as a highly engaging gaming experience and give respect where it is due
144605 while a high end gaming pc is many times more powerful than current generation consoles and you could in theory do significantly greater things on it the downsides of the platform have to support multiple generations of different hardware and driver interface layers

144619 also we found the segregation between muslim men and women at events more visible at queen mary
144620 clearly we in no way associate ourselves with these views however also integral to the spirit of university life is free speech and debate and on occasion speakers will make statements that are deemed offensive
144621 this disgusting report is a reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right wing think tank not the views of muslim students across britain only 632 muslim students were asked vague and misleading questions and their answers were willfully misinterpreted
144622 dangerous increase in the spread of extremism in leading university campuses
144623 the finding that a large number of students think it is okay to kill in the name of religion is alarming

144710 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
144711 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
144712 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
144713 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
144714 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
144715 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
144716 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
144717 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
144718 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
144719 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
144720 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
144721 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
144722 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
144723 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
144724 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
144725 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

144727 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
144728 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
144729 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
144730 people dont notice whether its winter or summer when theyre happy
144731 what else does wall street and the financial industry do besides cripple corporate strategic efforts
144732 but a landgrab by big hedge funds and private equity firms might create new problems the securities amp exchange commission and the finance industry regulatory authority oversee investment banks to some degree and the federal reserve is moving in that direction but hedge funds are largely unregulated and arent bound to make any disclosures to anyone but their investors even that information is often incomplete a move by hedge funds into traditional corporate finance would mean even less transparency than exists on wall street now

144736 the tide is super low out there right now but these conditions really suit my surfing
144737 i think i managed to pick off the best waves in that heat and they really opened up for me and allowed me to perform im stoked to advance through round 2 and im looking forward to the rest of the event
144738 ive yet to really have a breakout result this season
144739 i feel like i have been building momentum the last two events though and the wave here in indo is one that i could really do well at i think the swell is supposed to pick up over the next few days and i hope it does game on
144740 no one wants to win heats that way but its a competition and thats how it goes sometimes
144741 i had a good start to the heat and then held priority for the back half i should have done my job a little better and stayed on him a bit closer towards the end and i would have been in better position to perform on that wave but that was my mistake and i had to take off anyway
144742 i lost a bit on skin on the reef on my elbow and my foot and my ass but it was worth it to get through the heat
144743 its so shallow out there this afternoon but i am very happy to advance through to round 3 the wave here is good for me on my forehand and i am hoping for a good result here

144772 it will be a long long time before the republican party regains its lost credibility despite president bushs twin victories this decade has been an absolute disaster for the gop the disease of egotism slowly sapped health and strength from the partys body ultimately leaving the gop in a comatose state the partys condition is not terminal but it is certainly critical although the now troubled economy has been strong for most of this decade and although we have avoided a second terrorist attack one cannot objectively blame the country for having a dim view of the president and his party instead of the disciplined conservatism of the reagan era bush and the gop gave america unchecked government waste obedience to the lobbyist class and a war that began in 2003 but was not waged with true effectiveness until 2007 not the greatest of track recor ds after barack obama defeats john mccain and doesnt that result seem etched in stone at this point we will witness another surge a surge of humility on the right a recognition that bush and the gop spent the 2000s blowing a golden opportunity atoning for the political sins of this decade will be a painful process but one that the gop will have to endure as part of this atonement the gop must agree to be honest with the electorate about what it stands for and what it does not actually support if the party is to go forth and sin no more it must drop the fantastical notion that it supports limited federal government the last republican main eventer who was sincerely committed to the notion of a restrained federal government was newt gingrich and its been a decade since he wielded power on capitol hill most republican congressmen and senators couldnt care less about actually reducing the size and scope of government if they did theyd abandon the gop en masse and join the libertarian party the gop is just as pro government as the democrats everybody knows this so why pretend otherwise the party can rebrand itself as an entity that believes in responsible and effective government as opposed to an entity that believes in fostering dependence on washington but attempting to resurrect the image of the gop as a entity opposed to big government per se is inherently nonsensical atonement will also require the gop to speak coherently on social issues as opposed to putting out mixed messages yes the partys credibility on abortion remains solid but what about issues of marriage and family how can the gop claim to support traditional marriage when only one faction of the party earnestly supports efforts to legally define marriage as the union of one man and one woman how can prominent republicans express support for the idea that children should be raised by a mother and a father and then remain silent when a prominent conservative commentator laura ingraham adopts a child with the intention of raising her as a single parent the gop should either ignore these issues or promote a social vision that does not come across as self contradictory
144773 work as if you lived in the early days of a better nation

144822 this could take a while and im patient and our military and our troops on the ground are on the hunt until we can accomplish our objectives
144823 it is more exciting than we could have imagined the great thing i learned is that prayer works

144990 constituye un secreto a voces que estamos totalmente marginados y ninguneados por la junta regional del pp baleares que no dispone ni de cinco minutos para comunicar sus decisiones al alcalde de ciutadella uno de los nicos que tienen en baleares y que no perdi las elecciones en la ltima convocatoria como pas con la mayor a
144991 el pp de ciutadella ha conseguido con el actual equipo de gobierno ganar dos veces consecutivas las elecciones y que el alcalde que fue elegido en 2003 sea a n alcalde un hito nunca logrado aparte de ser el aut ntico granero de votos del pp en menorca
144992 con los menosprecios las verdades a medias y conductas desleales de la junta insular del pp de menorca podr amos llenar un libro pero no es el momento ni tenemos ganas tampoco es necesario creemos que es de dominio p blico cu l es el trato recibido

145020 you can be a very successful mep who works very hard at european level but it might not in the end be determinant to having a top position on the list in the end it will be more important to be in good terms with the national parties that draw up the list
145021 as a single individual you could not join the european socialist party or the epp party the only way to become a member is through your national party
145022 the media pays very little attention to european elections eu actors are generally invisible and the elections are labelled boring even before they take place
145023 when the media constantly predicts low voter turnout it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy
145024 you will really feel that the greens are acting together rather than just speaking together
145025 in some countries the common campaign will be 99 of the campaign because they do not want to add a national touch to it whereas in other countries the common campaign might only make up 15
145026 traditionally we feel it is our own voters who stay away
145027 we want a manifesto that offers not only a clear choice between left and right but one that has also been shaped through consultation and debate we want to show that social democrats have different politics from the conservatives and that we do politics in a different way too
145028 to call such a group the parliamentary representation of a political party is no more than a game of words and a simple misleading of voters
145029 weve got baseball to be played in august in september but certainly coming in here and beating a good opponent in their own ballpark four times is something to feel good about
145030 oh i dont know about statements we came in here knowing that milwaukee was playing solid baseball we came in here with a purpose in mind to win some baseball games and thats exactly what we did
145031 weve come up with something where i can actually keep my arm going and throw and not feel it
145032 weve done that a few times just to keep the arm going go from there in a few days i feel like ive been saying a few days for about three weeks im honestly tired of talking about it tired of dealing with it tired of looking at it tired of touching it
145033 i did my throwing today and im going to quit thinking about it for a while
145034 its the darndest thing ive ever seen as far as skin i cant explain it and nobody here can explain it ive been to several doctors and i just havent gotten any better we tried just about everything we could think of and probably tried some things we shouldnt have time will be the best thing for it
145035 i know where it came from ive played this game a long time
145036 i could bet a lot of money that didnt come from the pitcher thats something they can deal with
145037 i had 112 pitches one start before too but i think i was a little more efficient here today
145038 we have to watch him but every game he has pitched he has given us a chance to win

145056 because weve grown up thinking of ourselves in relation to the political media entertainment ephemera in our safe and comfortable homes given the time to think about how we would fit into this or that band or tv show or movies and how we would look doing it
145057 of course its inevitable its ubiquitous you see it right
145058 then why are you talking about exhibitionism its a ridiculous term someone wants to celebrate their existence and you call it exhibitionism its niggardly if you dont want anyone to know about your existence you might as well kill yourself youre taking up space air
145059 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress

145083 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu ambil menjadi teman kepercayaanmu orang orang yang di luar kalanganmu karena mereka tidak henti hentinya menimbulkan kemudharatan bagimu mereka menyukai apa yang menyusahkan kamu telah nyata kebencian dari mulut mereka dan apa yang disembunyikan oleh hati mereka adalah lebih besar lagi sungguh telah kami terangkan kepadamu ayat ayat kami jika kamu memahaminya
145084 ada beberapa orang kaum muslimin yang menjalin hubungan dekat dengan beberapa orang yahudi mengingat mereka adalah tetangga dan orang orang yang pernah saling bersumpah untuk saling mewarisi di masa jahiliyyah lalu allah menurunkan ayat yang berisi larangan menjadikan orang orang yahudi sebagai teman dekat karena dikhawatirkan menjadi sebab munculnya godaan iman ayat yang dimaksudkan adalah ayat di atas
145085 mereka hendak menyesatkan kalian sebagaimana mereka telah sesat maka allah melarang orang orang beriman untuk memasukkan orang orang munafik dengan meninggalkan orang orang yang beriman ke dalam rumah atau menjadikan mereka sebagai orang dekat
145086 yang allah maksudkan adalah orang orang khawarij orang yang memiliki pemahaman mudah mengafirkan orang lain tanpa alasan yang jelas
145087 di manakah juru tulismu minta dia supaya membacakannya di hadapan banyak orang
145088 jangan dekatkan mereka kepada kalian padahal allah telah menjauhkan mereka jangan muliakan mereka padahal allah telah menghinakan mereka jangan percaya kepada mereka padahal allah sudah menegaskan bahwa mereka suka khianat terhadap amanah
145089 janganlah kalian mempekerjakan ahli kitab yahudi dan nasrani karena mereka menghalalkan suap untuk menyelesaikan urusan kalian dan urusan rakyat kalian manfaatkanlah orang orang yang merasa takut kepada allah
145090 ada seorang budak laki laki nasrani dari daerah hirah yang paling jago dalam tulis menulis dan terkenal sebagi seorang yang amanah berkenankah anda seandainya dia menjadi sekretaris anda
145091 jika demikian berarti aku telah menjadikan non muslim sebagai orang kepercayaanku
145092 hal ini menunjukkan bahwa umar menjadikan ayat ini sebagi dalil bahwa menjadikan orang nasrani sebagi teman dekat adalah suatu yang terlarang
145093 riwayat dari khalifah umar ditambah ayat di atas adalah dalil bahwa orang kafir dzimmi tidak boleh dipekerjakan sebagai juru tulis sehingga merasa lebih tinggi dari kaum muslimin dan mengetahui rahasia rahasia umat sehingga dikhawatirkan akan disampaikan kepada musuh orang kafir harbi
145094 dalam ayat tersebut terdapat dalil bahwa meminta tolong dengan kafir dzimmi jika terkait dengan urusan kaum muslimin adalah suatu hal yang terlarang
145095 sesungguhnya bithonah seseorang adalah kekasih dan orang pilihannya yang mengetahui berbagai hal rahasia yang dia miliki sahabat semisal ini tidak mungkin kecuali setelah adanya kesamaan tujuan hidup agama dan karakter dan bersahabat karena allah bukan karena tendensi tertentu karena sahabat adalah satu jiwa dalam raga yang berbeda jika dua orang tersebut tidak seiman maka persahabatannya tentu akan segera berantakan
145096 keadaan telah berubah total di masa kini yahudi dan nasrani diangkat sebagai para juru tulis dan orang orang kepercayaan hal tersebut bahkan menjadi kebanggaan bagi para penguasa yang kurang paham dengan agama
145097 tidaklah allah mengutus seorang nabi atau mengangkat seorang khalifah melainkan pasti memiliki dua jenis orang dekat ada yang mengajak dan memotivasi untuk berbuat kebaikan sebaliknya yang kedua malah mengajak dan memotivasi untuk mengerjakan keburukan orang yang terjaga adalah orang yang benar benar allah jaga
145098 ungkapan permusuhan telah nampak jelas melalui mulut orang orang munafik ketika berada di hadapan orang orang kafir yang sejalan dengan mereka mereka katakan bahwa mereka berhasil menipu islam dan umat islam serta menyampaikan ungkapan rasa benci terhadap orang orang yang beriman
145099 yang mereka sembunyikan dalam dada dada mereka itu lebih besar dibandingkan yang mereka nampakkan dengan lisan mereka
145100 para ulama bersepakat bahwa musuh tidak boleh memberikan persaksian yang menyudutkannya kepada yang menjadi musuhnya dalam kasus apapun meski dia adalah seorang yang baik agamanya jadi permusuhan itu menghilangkan nilai kejujuran seseorang lalu bagaimana dengan permusuhan dengan orang kafir

145121 the existing market in melbourne clearly shows that 60 per cent of all motorists fill up on the four cheapest days of the week
145122 in perth where fuelwatch is currently in existence 60 per cent of all motorists fill up on the four dearest days of the week and that has to suggest theres confusion in perth and they dont know when to find the cheapest fuel
145123 its our belief after analysing all the data that it would appear that its anti competitive it will lead to the removal of price cycles it means that melbournians in particular will be denied access to weekly discounted fuel

145191 i dont think that politicizing the olympic games will do anything good to address any of those issues
145192 and i think such an attempt also runs counter to the spirit of the olympic games and goes against the shared aspiration of people from around the world
145193 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
145194 the people of the world and the people of china are waiting for this moment the olympics are being organized by china with one fifth of the worlds population this shows the worlds trust in china and it is chinas contribution to the world

145221 n o se parece com nenhum outro presidente nas notas de d lares
145222 os coment rios de obama s o divisivos negativos vergonhosos e errados
145223 o que obama estava dizendo era que ele n o chegou at aqui depois de passar d cadas em washington ele estava se referindo ao fato de ser novo no cen rio pol tico

145236 we thought the best way was to drop the prices to get people to come in and have a look at what a nice place weve got
145237 they dont understand we will always win but just to prove a point and to let them know we are serious ive dropped the price

145275 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
145276 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
145277 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
145278 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
145279 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
145280 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations

145381 jorge vergara irrumpi en la escena futbol stica para restituirle a las chivas su orgullo maltrecho
145382 gregorio orozco tom la sugerencia en serio pero el nuevo nombre no trajo consigo el cambio de colores los mismos con los que los jugadores de hoy saltan a la cancha vista al paso del tiempo no podemos dejar de considerar que la decisi n de gregorio orozco de mantener los pantaloncillos azul marino y el jersey a rayas rojas y blancas marc el inicio de una personalidad una afici n y un arrastre popular que no tienen punto de comparaci n en el futbol mexicano
145383 el amor o el respeto a la camiseta el guadalajara es el nico equipo de nuestro futbol adulto cuyas camisetas no se han contaminado de la viruela de los logotipos las camisetas de las chivas que brincan cada juego a la cancha no llevan marcas de nada s lo su tradicional rayado blanquirrojo ning n anuncio ning n tem publicitario
145384 desde un principio quiso para las chivas limpiar la camiseta adi s a la publicidad
145385 cu les son los tres pa ses m s importantes del mundo
145386 estados unidos francia e inglaterra y lo son entre otras razones porque los colores de sus banderas son los mismos que los del uniforme de las chivas rayadas del guadalajara
145387 y en cuanto a m xico ya tiene el rojo y el blanco pero le estorba el verde que es deplorable por lo cual declar moslo sin tapujos mientras m xico use el color verde jam s podr ser campe n del mundo para que lo sea deber lucir en su uniforme los colores rojo blanco y azul

145432 perhaps the most flagrant violation of an individuals personal privacy rights

145436 i saw her when i left today and she was calling me names and stuff so i cant get away from it
145437 the rumors which began in england about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue
145438 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
145439 they didnt kiss or hold hands but they sat very close together
145440 at one point lindsay laid her head on sams shoulder you could tell they are very close

145444 i just told the judge that mr spears and mr lutfi have reached a private agreement and no hearing or order is necessary at this time
145445 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or anytime in the future

145463 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
145464 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
145465 the danger exists in methods and tactics having absolutely nothing to do with picture taking
145466 in fact removing a camera from the equation is a very effective way of looking at this situation candidly
145467 recently the camera has come to serve as all but an official license to encroach on someones right to protect themselves from threats of danger it is also the most socially acceptable way to come within inches from someone who you do not know and who does not know you
145468 we are a week away from the season so there will be no messing about
145469 west brom were concerned that it was a testimonial but roberto martinez has said it will be a proper game

145494 we are aware of a recent posting on the internet and believe this is a malicious hoax
145495 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority we are taking this issue seriously and are cooperating fully with federal authorities
145496 the transition from adolescence to adulthood has been shown to be a time for taking on many negative health behaviors including increases in smoking and alcohol use and decreases in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
145497 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese

145500 the ability to derive als motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery for the first time researchers will be able to look at als cells under a microscope and see why they die if we can figure out how a persons motor neurons die we will figure out how to save motor neurons
145501 for the first time we have the opportunity to examine cellular and molecular defects in motor neurons and glial cells derived from patients with als and we can now begin drug screens on disease specific classes of human motor neurons
145502 through the work of the jenifer estess laboratory for stem cell research we now can glimpse the new age of als research an age of progress and promise
145503 it has been a privilege to collaborate with kevin eggan and his team and to contribute to this critical step forward we will continue to work hand in hand with harvard researchers and project a l s to exploit the potential of these cells for drug screening
145504 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
145505 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
145506 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
145507 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
145508 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
145509 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
145510 the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
145511 they blamed it on everything else under the sun they worked in loud factories they listened to loud music one got hit by a tractor
145512 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older
145513 often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
145514 in many types of hereditary hearing loss its likely that environmental factors that people can control such as smoking and exposure to noise also can influence how severe the hearing loss is and how early in life it begins
145515 you can have children tested early so they dont have speech or school problems
145516 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
145517 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
145518 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
145519 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
145520 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
145521 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise

145546 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed

145605 it is clearly to everyones benefit to get rid of the awful offices the council has at the moment they are akin to a multi storey car park and a real blot on the landscape
145606 everyone in the crew mechanics and engineers did a tremendous job to prepare the cars for this difficult and demanding race through their efforts the drivers had a trouble free race it was a flawless effort by everyone on the team the result speaks for itself and more than makes up for the disappointment of our first outing in 2007 as this achievement is also the product of a collective effort i must also thank all our partners including yokohama bmw and petronas for their incredible support throughout the weekend without which none of this would have been possible
145607 about a week ago we started laying the new tracks and work is going very well
145608 this double whammy has raised the recession worries again for america and the numbers this time around could be said to be somewhat artificially polished up by the federal reserves tax rebate
145609 the concern is that further deterioration in the housing market and overall economy is going to weigh on gdp figures later in the year leaving todays number looking like something of an over optimistic blip
145610 hun ouders kennen elkaar al meer dan 15 jaar en hebben blokhutten bij elkaar om de hoek eric en kate zijn al jaren goede vrienden
145611 het is onvermijdelijk dat verschillende volkeren en nationaliteiten een uiteenlopende mening hebben over bepaalde onderwerpen
145612 door de olympische spelen te organiseren willen we tonen dat we een vreedzame natie zijn
145613 ze hoorde iets en zag het gorduin bewegen plots zag ze een mannelijke verschijning
145614 hij begon te roepen en schuwde daarbij het gebruik van het woord fuck niet hij was agressief en kwaad
145615 hij wil zijn excuses aanbieden en dan vooral aan het zweedse koppeltje hij geeft ook toe dat hij te veel gedronken had
145616 we zetten alle middelen in om de zwaarste brand in de geschiedenis van antalya de baas te blijven op dit moment is al circa 4 000 hectare in vlammen opgegaan

145618 een sexy buik is niet voorbehouden voor jonge vrouwen en dat is goed nieuwe voor alle vrouwen die een strakke buik willen behouden
145619 de kans is re el dat er atleten sterven aan een astma aanval tijdens wedstrijden
145620 de combinatie van atleten die tot het uiterste gaan en de luchtvervuiling door de smog kan leiden tot een zeer ernstige en mogelijk dodelijke astma aanval ik twijfel er niet dat we een grote toevloed van astma incidenten zullen hebben het zou mij niet verbazen als daarbij een dode valt
145621 de luchtkwaliteit in peking geeft reden tot bezorgdheid maar door ons uitgebreide onderzoek kunnen we nu elke atleet apart opvolgen
145622 mensen waarvan we niet wisten dat ze aan astma leden kunnen we nu daarvoor behandelen de smog houdt echter g n gevaren in voor de gezondheid van een atleet
145623 ze staan sowieso onder stress in combinatie met de luchtvervuiling in peking die echt uniek is in zijn soort is de kans op een astma aanval erg groot een gevaarlijke cocktail die tot de dood kan leiden
145624 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
145625 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
145626 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
145627 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
145628 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
145629 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater
145630 americans should be outraged at the latest sweetheart deal in washington
145631 congress will put u s taxpayers on the hook for potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out fannie mae and freddie mac its a tribute to what these two institutions which most americans have never heard of have bought with more than 170 million worth of lobbyists in the past decade
145632 the management and the board should immediately be replaced multimillion dollar salaries should be cut and bonuses and other compensation should be eliminated they should cease all lobbying activities and drop all payments to outside lobbyists
145633 that limits their ability to borrow shrinks their size until they are no longer a threat to our economy and privatizes and eliminates their links to the government
145634 he also argues for strong regulation of fan and fred

145642 toen we vanmorgen vroeg opstonden voor het gebed hoorde ik op de benedenverdieping een scherpe fluittoon
145643 vijf minuten later hing er een sterke gasgeur in de slaapzalen en vlak daarop volgde een grote ontploffing

145654 some information in the cia charge sheet was so damning that the pakistanis could not deny them
145655 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
145656 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone
145657 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a good substitute for exercise training good news for adepts of pulmonary rehabilitation
145658 without minimizing the importance of the quest to optimize the results of pulmonary rehabilitation we had to appreciate that only a small portion of patients with copd actually engage in pulmonary rehabilitation so improved access is important for pr to achieve its full potential from a public health perspective
145659 these and other studies are finally gaining recognition that pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential element of comprehensive care for patients with copd the weight of the evidence has succeeded in gaining medicare payment for rehabilitation services which has been one of our major hurdles to access
145660 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
145661 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
145662 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
145663 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
145664 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come

145668 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
145669 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
145670 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
145671 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
145672 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
145673 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
145674 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
145675 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
145676 we expect our fuel bill to top three billion pounds this year the equivalent of more than eight million pounds every day
145677 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
145678 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control

145697 as a result who suffers but these honest investors whose hard earned savings end up like worthless chicken scratch on the bottom of a bird cage
145698 this is yet another example of how the governments failure ends up hurting hard working people in the pocketbook
145699 if american states are sophisticated enough to see this for what it has turned out to be surely to god we in canada should be as sophisticated and help people in the market who are looking for things to invest in and things to make money in agriculture

145708 absolutely were actually trying to crack that were trying to figure out some ideas for it but yes it would be a prequel
145709 in the prequel its slightly different because its earlier we were three years later so we did a lot of research into the way nature would have sort of overtaken the city with the cracks in the streets and the weeds
145710 the first time you got out there and shut down 6th avenue its like how are we going to do this day after day after day but by the end its just like you know how to do it how to let the traffic through in between set ups and you just sort of get the routine down so thats not the issue
145711 as youll have gathered from our many and varied blogs broadcasts and photos weve been lost in a world of new music over the last few months
145712 writing songs pushing our limits making fools of ourselves and generally having a wicked time we started out in paris where jon brion inspired us to create first and think later
145713 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise where we made a pact with stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste where we were hypnotised by marlene dietrich and spent many a long night throwing ideas around in the crumbling cabaret esque glamour of our favourite bar
145714 weve hidden ourselves away in the depths of the english countryside
145715 recorded a new track in london at the last possible moment and now were in los angeles tying up the loose ends
145716 we talked about doing a joint together a whole album
145717 its not about just selling records for me anymore cause ive done that its about making something that people will remember
145718 im not a judgmental person i may not agree but im not going to judge you for it because we all gotta be accountable and we all gotta take responsibility for the choices that we make
145719 but be that as it may im not going to stop being his friend because he made a mistake i think thats when you need your friends the most when you have made a mistake
145720 the number of economic and political freedoms we enjoy today are something past generations could only dream of
145721 sure we considered re releasing a radio edit of you me dancing and trying to get famous and scraping another tour out of that but our parents unanimously agreed that if we did they would never speak to us again
145722 rather we are blessed with having an incredibly supportive record label in wichita and they are as excited about such freedom frivolities and spontaneity in releases as we are
145723 this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming

145727 erst vor kurzem 24 juli ist im new england journal of medicine eine wissenschaftliche studie erschienen es handelte sich bei den patienten ausschlie lich um personen die schon lange vorbehandelt wurden und bei denen die verwendeten medikamente versagten
145728 in einer subgruppe der patienten gelang das sogar noch bei ber 90 prozent
145729 binnen kurzer zeit wurde eine ganze reihe neuen arzneimitteln gegen hiv verf gbar
145730 mit etravirin und darunavir gibt es jetzt auch polymerase und protease hemmer der n chsten generation
145731 allerdings muss man auch sagen dass wir in sterreich wahrscheinlich insgesamt nicht mehr als 20 bis 30 hiv patienten haben die multiresistenzen aufweisen und bei denen die behandlung versagt

145758 that was like falling down without wearing a shirt on a freshly tarred street where a pigeon had recently died in ninety five degree fahrenheit weather so that the tar is a little melted and sticky and the feathers are coming off the bird what i mean to say is its not as bad perhaps as being tarred and feathered all the way but just a little bit

145760 de kans is re el dat er atleten sterven aan een astma aanval tijdens wedstrijden
145761 de combinatie van atleten die tot het uiterste gaan en de luchtvervuiling door de smog kan leiden tot een zeer ernstige en mogelijk dodelijke astma aanval ik twijfel er niet dat we een grote toevloed van astma incidenten zullen hebben het zou mij niet verbazen als daarbij een dode valt
145762 de luchtkwaliteit in peking geeft reden tot bezorgdheid maar door ons uitgebreide onderzoek kunnen we nu elke atleet apart opvolgen
145763 mensen waarvan we niet wisten dat ze aan astma leden kunnen we nu daarvoor behandelen de smog houdt echter g n gevaren in voor de gezondheid van een atleet
145764 ze staan sowieso onder stress in combinatie met de luchtvervuiling in peking die echt uniek is in zijn soort is de kans op een astma aanval erg groot een gevaarlijke cocktail die tot de dood kan leiden

145782 you cant judge campaign numbers the same way youd judge a presidents budget
145783 but i cant see any way he could get there under the policies theyve been proposing theres a disconnect there
145784 sen mccains proposals on the stump are often far more sweeping than the more measured options outlined by his campaign
145785 he has been very clear that hed like to develop an alternative simplified tax
145786 maybe thats because they are on both sides of every policy
145787 the difference in enthusiasm among voters is also a difference in enthusiasm among policy wonks

145819 for graham to walk into the club it was overwhelming for the players and it is just terrific to see graham back
145820 and we realise hes got an enormous amount of work in his recovery but it was just fantastic to see him back around the club
145821 its been a tough few weeks with everything thats happened with graham and happened to the richmond football club so to see graham walk into the rooms this morning its just put a smile on everybodys face
145822 you cant control the ones that happen during the game the playfair and the mick oloughlin the week before that
145823 thats just part of the game but weve just got to be careful and just make sure we pick a fit team and goodesy we cant play him this week but well get someone in whos healthy and thats probably a start
145824 well we really didnt run that well i think its more of a mindset thing because the week before we were able to run with carlton in the second half when we were two down so i think its just a mindset for the players

145842 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
145843 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
145844 some of the bigger shareholders want to push for a new ceo
145845 there is a small possibility that shareholder disappointment results in jerry yang being moved aside in a sort of bloodless coup

145862 we were going to do a completely electronic album but he brought out this band in us were using traditional instruments a lot more a lot of vintage synths and stuff hes really influenced by joe meek so he had us putting a guitar part through a ventilation shaft just to see what happened

145903 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight

145908 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations

145914 we expect our fuel bill to top three billion pounds this year the equivalent of more than eight million pounds every day
145915 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
145916 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
145917 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
145918 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
145919 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
145920 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
145921 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
145922 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
145923 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

145937 as internet devices continue to evolve screens get larger and connectivity gets faster the ability to access
145938 we believe small portable devices ranging from mobile phones to subnotebooks will be increasingly used as advanced productivity devices and by enabling those devices to reach host computers they become even more useful these mobile devices lack the computing resources of a powerful desktop pc but via remote access the user of a mobile device does not need to be limited by a slow cpu and the lack of storage
145939 human cartilage injuries heal poorly and can lead to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis
145940 this is an enormous clinical problem it is estimated that one quarter of the adult population will have some kind of arthritis by 2020
145941 if we can identify what genes or proteins are necessary for cartilage to heal we can work toward finding similar genes and proteins in humans
145942 theres a lot of attention today on global food shortages
145943 weve found a gene that is key for proper chloroplast function this finding might some day help scientists develop plants that grow better and can serve as more nutritious food
145944 some insects have adapted to life underwater by using this bubble as an external lung
145945 a 25 percent drop in fertility is the equivalent of a 25 percent drop in the reproductive population it remains to be seen whether other species exhibit the same effect but translated to commercially and ecologically important species such as lobsters crabs mussels and fish acidification would have far reaching consequences
145946 species with limestone skeletons or shells are hit particularly hard when the ph drops through a drop in ability to grow and a rise in mortality but and its a big but we dont yet know enough about the effects of acidification in the sea and i hope im wrong about the wider consequences of our results
145947 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
145948 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
145949 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
145950 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
145951 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
145952 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
145953 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
145954 who are open to doing something on the production side
145955 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
145956 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
145957 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
145958 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
145959 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
145960 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
145961 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
145962 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
145963 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
145964 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
145965 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
145966 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

145974 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
145975 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
145976 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
145977 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
145978 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
145979 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
145980 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
145981 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
145982 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
145983 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
145984 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
145985 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
145986 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
145987 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
145988 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
145989 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
145990 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
145991 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
145992 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
145993 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
145994 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
145995 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
145996 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
145997 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
145998 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
145999 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

146001 these plans would mean fishing would be prohibited in certain areas around the coast these no take zones could have a devastating effect on the livelihoods of fishermenwhomay be prohibited from fishing some of their traditional fishing grounds
146002 we as an association feel it is highly important fishermens voices are heard and the assembly listens to our opinions on matters involving welsh fisheries
146003 the inshore fisheries are the backbone of the welsh fishing industry and we feel the assembly should give priority to this part of the industry in order to protect small sustainable businesses
146004 in wales we hope to create some highly protected marine reserves
146005 consultation with all those who depend on and use the marine environment will be at the heart of this new opportunity
146006 wag believes a single management and enforcement body will best suit welsh needs proposals for the wag to assume full responsibility for fisheries management and enforcement in wales are being consulted on at the moment and we welcome the views of the industry the minister and officials are continuing to work with all interested parties
146007 the sector is widely recognised as being at the cutting edge which has resulted in inward investment particularly to anglesey with a real prospect of further investment to follow
146008 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
146009 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
146010 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
146011 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
146012 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
146013 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
146014 por que pedi que f ssemos a campanha de raul no rastro de cadoca porque ele nosso advers rio quando os eleitores perguntam a ele por mim ele diz nas ruas que estou viajando parece esquecer que o guia eleitoral e as inser es v m a vou no rastro de cadoca por vingan a n o vou porque cadoca est querendo fazer uma confus o na cabe a do eleitor e a minha tarefa esclarecer quem o meu candidato
146015 cadoca ainda est se aproveitando da liga o que tivemos ele diz que foi secret rio mas n o diz de quem n o revela ao eleitor que sequer fala comigo hoje em dia antes eu fazia caminhada de 18 19 minutos agora fa o de duas horas para esclarecer o eleitorado
146016 n o h interesse meu em tirar votos de mendon a por isso n o vou no rastro dele compartilhamos do mesmo alvo do mesmo objetivo somos da oposi o
146017 se mendon a for para o segundo turno apoiaremos ele em bloco
146018 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the u s did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
146019 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
146020 what the u s wants is a revamp especially among the isis units which deal with areas along the afghan border additionally the u s wants to see new structures in place for closer oversight on people in the field basically within the isi there has to be a strong internal affairs unit of a kind
146021 is failing the militants are gaining ground the u s and others are just pointing fingers towards others
146022 the report is more tittle tattle than based on hard evidence and we are deeply disappointed at the anecdotal nature of the fieldwork and the lack of appreciation of the great strides we have taken
146023 when you look at how people use technology embedded systems mobile computing mobile internet devices servers super computing in almost every aspect of technology linux is emerging as the dominant platform
146024 when a wall street trading application developer uses real time linux or when the defense department is creating real time technology for robust embedded defense systems that same technology gets contributed back to the linux kernel and it might benefit mobile phone developers by offering the tools to create more stability
146025 kan jeg skrive om alvorlige emner p en sjov m de
146026 hvor skal jeg mon placere pointen for at den st r tydeligst frem
146027 nogle er alt for gennemsigtige og andre kan man ikke se igennem jeg bruger
146028 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
146029 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
146030 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
146031 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
146032 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
146033 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
146034 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
146035 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
146036 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
146037 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
146038 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
146039 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
146040 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
146041 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
146042 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
146043 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
146044 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
146045 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
146046 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
146047 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
146048 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
146049 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
146050 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
146051 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
146052 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
146053 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
146054 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
146055 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
146056 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
146057 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

146202 i would have sacked him i think hes been grossly disloyal
146203 the national interest is now being damaged by these anonymous attacks on miliband
146204 we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
146205 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
146206 we have got to take the right decisions it is very difficult in a downturn for leaders right around the world
146207 you are the sort of person we need as prime minister
146208 the couple had rented a car and driven round the island with him i think the agreement was he was offered us 85 43 he demanded more and got us 150
146209 the burden was on the prosecution to prove involvement beyond reasonable doubt and that cannot be proven to the required degree
146210 ive put up my fee by 35 percent just like you
146211 on each table was a bucket filled with bottles of budweiser lager and red and white wine there was a also a free bar back at some of the hotels there were punch ups because everyone got so drunk
146212 at such a difficult time for our customers we need our staff to understand why energy prices are rising and what support is available to help our customers cope
146213 however were deeply disappointed with the behaviour of a few individuals who let us and our customers down after the briefing ended for which we sincerely apologise
146214 its just as it had been done for 30 years and its done at every stadium arena and theater in the country
146215 its part of doing business in the sports and entertainment business
146216 they go to stadium sponsors media sponsors talent agencies etc
146217 the government also gives an assurance that the retail price of petrol will not exceed rm2 70 a litre this year

146220 we still want to add a striker the wayne andrews fitness situation is ongoing and well assess that as it goes on
146221 if we can manipulate the squad in any other way we will do that the progression we aim for we believe we are getting there
146222 its an interesting time and its imperative we start the season well
146223 theres a big rotation moving into the sector that started with large caps in june and now its moving into smaller and mid size stocks
146224 its a bad draw for them theyre at their home olympic games and in their home country so the pressure and the expectations are all on them
146225 we knew we were going to face a tough pair because were not seeded
146226 they know theyll have to work very hard to beat us were feeling confident and im really really looking forward to it
146227 weve won the worlds the commonwealths and the europeans the only thing missing is the olympic gold i feel this is the best chance weve got to do that
146228 the olympic games is the greatest sporting event in the world its an honour to be here i cant wait to get out there and compete for team gb
146229 its a worse draw for them than it is for us weve missed a few tournaments so we knew we wouldnt be seeded in the top four im sure none of the top four wanted to be drawn against us we know theyre the top chinese pair but we dont need any more motivation to beat them
146230 theyre one of the best pairs in the world our aim is to go for gold and to get gold wed expect to play them somewhere along the line the draw wont get any easier
146231 it doesnt get any better than playing the top chinese pair at their home olympic games weve just got to try to turn them over
146232 wed like to play them but it would be in the final if we did that would be a brilliant advertisement for british badminton theres a long way to go before that
146233 its a difficult draw but you might as well take them on in the first round as the semi final or final
146234 if we want to win a medal well have to beat some of the best pairs in the world well go out there and give it a go
146235 im sure they wouldnt have wanted us in the first round if i was them id be quite worried
146236 it would be awesome to meet gail and nathan in the final we want to get gold and silver thats our goal but theres a long way to go
146237 the lambeth conference has failed to defend lesbian and gay human rights
146238 its fence sitting attempts to reconcile the opponents and defenders of homosexual human rights are doomed to failure there can be no reconciliation with bishops who want to deny gay people dignity respect and human rights
146239 archbishop peter akinola of nigeria has backed legislation to outlaw gay churches gay organisations gay hiv prevention programmes and gay human rights advocacy
146240 henry orombi the archbishop of uganda excommunicated heterosexual bishop christopher senyonjo after he spoke out against the persecution of lesbian and gay ugandans
146241 the anti gay diatribes of both men help fuel of the atmosphere of homophobic hatred discrimination and violence that exists in their countries
146242 archbishop rowan williams and the lambeth conference have not shown moral leadership their unwillingness to challenge homophobes within their own church is a major moral shortcoming and a tragic betrayal of the lgbt community
146243 even the pope is elected by his peers but what the anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
146244 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
146245 crouse hospital and community general hospital and their physicians are building a premier integrated delivery system the system encompasses a broad array of traditional and innovative health services to meet the present and future needs of the people of central new york it includes sophisticated information systems in support of the coordination of care and integration of services the system will provide our patients and the community the highest quality of healthcare services in the following ways excellence in patient care superior prompt service emphasizing respect and caring for our patients individual needs cost effective service delivery and improvement in the overall level and condition of our communitys health

146247 we see this as a huge victory no courts have ever really addressed farm animal welfare issues
146248 in the courts words the regulations as a whole are consistent with the meaning of the word
146249 i would characterize my reaction as being disappointed the agriculture department and state veterinarians who drew up these standards are the people that deal with animals every day all day
146250 most state animal cruelty laws have an exemption in their cruelty code for farm animals we have been trying to get a court to admit that for many many years
146251 the dispute has nothing to do with anyones love for animals or with the way in which any of us treats our pets rather it requires a balancing of the interests of people and organizations who would zealously safeguard the well being of all animals including those born and bred for eventual slaughter with the equally significant interests of those who make their living in animal husbandry and who contribute through their effort to our food supply
146252 because we find in those regulations both unworkable standards and an unacceptable delegation of authority to an ill defined category of presumed experts we conclude that the agriculture department failed in part to carry out its mandate we therefore conclude that some but not all of the regulations are invalid
146253 we are very happy about it particularly because it is a unanimous decision that is so rare
146254 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we were a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
146255 like a christmas tree with a bunch of other topics
146256 frankly in darfur today there is not a real peace agreement
146257 we do not have the kind of capacity that is needed to make a real difference
146258 one of the major problems theyve had is that darfur is such a large region and the conflict has really spread throughout most of that and into chad as well the neighbouring country
146259 and their numbers and their mobility do not allow them to supervise and ensure peace throughout the whole region
146260 and the mobility of the attackers the so called janjaweed allows them to hit and run in many parts of darfur where the peacekeepers are not stationed as the peacekeepers move the janjaweed move accordingly
146261 so its been very difficult for them to maintain peace and order throughout the entire region but they certainly have brought some stability to some parts
146262 for it to be resolved in a way that ensures a lasting peace and one that is acceptable to the majority of people in darfur and the rest of sudan there really needs to be a national reconciliation
146263 one that takes into account the grievances of people in the west that restores some sense of national government and takes into account some of the issues that the north south agreement the comprehensive peace agreement has addressed such as wealth distribution and power and decentralisation of power
146264 this is a response to their lack of responsible behaviour
146265 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
146266 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone
146267 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a good substitute for exercise training good news for adepts of pulmonary rehabilitation
146268 without minimizing the importance of the quest to optimize the results of pulmonary rehabilitation we had to appreciate that only a small portion of patients with copd actually engage in pulmonary rehabilitation so improved access is important for pr to achieve its full potential from a public health perspective
146269 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
146270 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
146271 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
146272 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
146273 two or more people who share goals and values have long term commitments to one another and reside usually in the same dwelling place
146274 when someone has rejection from their mother their father their family when they get out in the world they search they search for someone to fill that void i know this from experience because ive had kids come to me and latch hold to me like im their mother or like im their father because they can talk to me and im gay and their gay
146275 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
146276 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
146277 its something to distract me from my lack of broadband
146278 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems

146298 american officials said that the communications were intercepted before the july 7 bombing and that the c i a emissary stephen r kappes the agencys deputy director had been ordered to islamabad pakistans capital even before the attack
146299 the intercepts were not detailed enough to warn of any specific attack
146300 the government officials were guarded in describing the new evidence and would not say specifically what kind of assistance the isi officers provided to the militants
146301 the isi officers had not been renegades indicating that their actions might have been authorized by superiors
146302 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
146303 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
146304 the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
146305 wir waren schon in der vergangenen saison sehr gut ausgelastet viele kunden und partner sind uns in der 2 liga treu geblieben und nat rlich ist das interesse an unseren logen und businessangeboten nach dem aufstieg noch gestiegen
146306 it is pointless to talk to the governor again unless he sends us a concrete proposal on the land issue
146307 peu importe que a te blesse que ce soient des mots ou des gestes tu ne m rites pas a nen vaut pas la peine prends tes jambes ton cou et fuis
146308 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
146309 the trains will run with bullet proof locomotives and the drivers and other crew of the trains will wear bullet proof jackets while a huge contingent of paramilitary troopers assam police and railway protection force rpf have been deployed
146310 there is a certain accommodativeness in issuing passports by the authorities in some south indian states like kerala tamil nadu and andhra pradesh particularly kerala which helps people get hold of fraudulent passports
146311 basically there are two problems to this the passport itself can be a forged document or a person can procure an original passport from the passport office by producing fake documents in other words the passport may be original but the contents within might all be fake
146312 this practice has been going on for the last 15 years or so because of people searching for employment abroad
146313 security should be uniform all over the country you cannot have a tight security system in kashmir and a loose one in kerala our enemies will always look for the weak link
146314 we never knowingly issue passports based on fake documents with whatever expertise we have we do all verification of the documents
146315 we have noticed people coming with fake documents whenever we see such people we detain them
146316 if the people at the counter become suspicious of the documents they refer the applicant along with the documents to me then the applicant vanishes from the counter itself
146317 uae authorities are very concerned about security they are very strict when it comes to security the iris test they have put in place at entry points to the country has proved to be very effective
146318 it is we in india who are very complacent we need to have harsher penalties to deal with such people in india people found with fraudulent passports are let off with a fine of just rs 5 000 we need to amend the laws
146319 the problem is not seen among businessmen or professionals it is with the low income group people who search for jobs abroad particularly in the gulf
146320 by showing the outpass you can apply for a fresh passport in india
146321 these people then try to reenter the countries which had sent them back with their new passports
146322 for example in the uae with the new iris test it can easily be found whether the person had been sent back from the country earlier
146323 there are reports of around 25 such cases every month in which people have been sent back to kerala from the uae
146324 we have received information about such activities particularly in the kasargod district of kerala
146325 well dear mommy and daddy fall in love and get married one night they go into their bedroom they kiss and hug and have sex
146326 that means the daddy puts his penis in the mommys vagina thats how you get a baby honey
146327 mom is it true that babies come from where a man puts his penis in a woman
146328 yes its true dear do you have any other questions about sex
146329 im going to numb your mouth with this jelly and then im going to give you a little pinch with more numbing stuff but i will go very slow to not you
146330 if you feel like i need to stop just raise your hand
146331 your going to feel the pressure of me pulling but should not hurt
146332 if it hurts at any point raise your hand to stop
146333 well get the professor no matter how smart he is
146334 i dont care if youre tired we will get him weve been after him for six years now it cant be that hard
146335 you will find the professor or you will all lose your jobs
146336 we were just looking around up here weve been told this place is haunted and decided to check it out
146337 my name doesnt concern you or anyone else so may i ask who you are
146338 sorry we dont tell strange people living in haunted houses our names
146339 too bad i heard everything you said when you came in through that door
146340 in fact would you like to see my latest experiment
146341 no its a t c t d a time control and transportation device
146342 it can bend space and time around itself and those in contact with it
146343 because the first attempt severely changed the future and the second time i fixed it up since then i was too afraid to use it again
146344 i am being chased down by two of the most powerful companies in the world theyre both extremely pissed off at me because my computer hacked into their systems and found out that the companies are working together to take control of the world they have figured out how to control peoples minds and are in the process of developing a new biochemical weapon and they know about the t c t d i had just started creating it but some how they knew i could do it
146345 in a pit with a lion on a snowy day
146346 that is the result of understanding compassion careful study and analysis
146347 knowledge that is part of an overall campaign of self affirmation
146348 in november 1996 the board of directors of the national association of realtors approved an agreement between the realtors information network rin nars wholly owned subsidiary and realselect inc to take over the operations of nars official internet site realtor com at the time many business models were considered to finance the development of realtor com nars leadership team decided against using dues dollars or asking for a special assessment of the membership to fund realtor com while homestore and its investors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build and operate realtor com no nar funds or nar member dues dollars have ever been used for the creation or operation of the site
146349 outsourcing to move com controlling your e estate technology is important thats the very reason i dont rely solely on active rain for all my marketing efforts you might sell it to someone who isnt so friendly
146350 id rather pay trulia and i aint gonna pay them either
146351 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
146352 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
146353 we expect our fuel bill to top three billion pounds this year the equivalent of more than eight million pounds every day
146354 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
146355 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
146356 i am extremely keen to talk to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the brookwood road area of huyton between midnight and 2am this morning
146357 i am particularly interested in speaking to anyone who may have seen a 4x4 vehicle possibly a mitsubishi shogun in the area as information they have could be vital to our investigation
146358 i am also interested to speak to anyone who has seen anything suspicious in the croxteth lane area between 1 30am and 2 30am this morning
146359 it is all in all only acceptable in view of the duration of the settlement and the performance related one off payment it is imperative however that the increased costs be compensated by higher productivity resolution of the pay dispute on their own initiative by
146360 every length to resume flight operations quickly for our customers in the customary reliability and quality
146361 is however provisional on pay parity for cabin crew staff and pending agreement between lufthansa ver di and ufo the flight attendants union
146362 we dont need to discuss what we already know about living together
146363 hes a serious person and that i should get used to it
146364 we have all worked extremely hard to meet our commitment to commence production of the mg tf in august
146365 we are delighted to have reached this important point and are looking forward to seeing the cars in showrooms shortly
146366 we have taken the very best options from the car that you saw before and put them into one package
146367 if you look at the pre orders that we have had through our dealers about 70 percent are already sold and that tells its own story
146368 the launch of this car also marks the re introduction of the mg brand to the uk
146369 existing mg owners our huge band of enthusiasts and fans of the authentic sports car driving experience have looked forward to this day for a long time
146370 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
146371 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
146372 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
146373 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
146374 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
146375 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because
146376 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
146377 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse

146379 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
146380 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
146381 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
146382 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone

146385 these and other studies are finally gaining recognition that pulmonary rehabilitation is an essential element of comprehensive care for patients with copd the weight of the evidence has succeeded in gaining medicare payment for rehabilitation services which has been one of our major hurdles to access

146421 in that process you diminish some of the benefits of open source you loose the synergies of cooperation
146422 create a level playing field upon which vendors can be judged
146423 such a thing could actually cause more harm than good by confusing potential adopters

146439 theres just not enough advice for new expats coming here
146440 so people rely on blogs online forums word of mouth and the dubai urban myths that you get told by the taxi drivers when you arrive
146441 saying you dont know about the law is not an excuse

146443 business people go along wanting easy answers and they just come and they say tell me the dos and donts
146444 but all these dos and donts are based on looking at the external perceptions of culture
146445 you cant tell the expat you cant do this you cant do that
146446 were going to get the information he might not have much at all right now until we evaluate it further we really cant say much else

146468 unite will be working closely with spanish trade union colleagues strong bilateral relations already exist with the cc
146469 any merger must provide for increased job security as well as protected terms and conditions for thousands of dedicated professional employees and we will be seeking clear assurances from both ba and iberia on these matters as well as the future of their operations we will be seeking specific safeguards in respect of any potential opportunity for ba to utilise non uk based cabin crew as well as protections for workers in customer service and ground handling operations
146470 this comes on the back of other merger consultations that the union has been involved with
146471 however unite members have experienced the often negative effect consolidation has on their terms and conditions of employment therefore although the merger of ba with iberia could be seen as a positive development within the industry we are mindful of the long term impact it may have on our members jobs and earnings ba has a proud record unlike other uk carriers of keeping its fleet maintenance in house and unite has supported this position for many years we would be opposed to any cost cutting which results in the outsourcing of this strategically important work

146521 sunt doua echipe valoroase conteaza forma jucatorilor nu conteaza unde joci primul meci daca ai valoare cu siguranta steaua are o experienta importanta in aceasta competitie dar nici galatasaray nu e o incepatoare
146522 daca picau cu atletico era mai rau totusi galata e campioana turciei si a dat multi jucatori nationalei la euro e un meci foarte greu se poate trece de turci dar cu eforturi foarte mari
146523 o sa fie o dubla interesanta cine va juca mai bine va castiga eu am jucat la ambele formatii si nu pot sa tin cu una anume va depinde foarte mult de forma in care se vor afla cele doua echipe din punctul meu de vedere steaua trebuie sa joace bine in ambele manse pentru a se califica suporterii turci incurajeaza foarte mult echipa galatasaray este echipa numarul 1 in turcia

146537 but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
146538 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
146539 in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits

146541 the response quotes and expands upon an existing legal opinion to help frame the response

146561 wer einen mann mit dieser politischen bilanz aus der spd ausschlie en will hat nicht mehr alle tassen im schrank
146562 die in demokratischer streitkultur ge bte sozialdemokratie muss solche auseinandersetzungen anders als mit ausschluss beantworten
146563 wahlen gewinnen wir nur gemeinsam wolfgang clement geh rt genauso zur spd wie andrea nahles und hermann scheer
146564 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist wer sich so unsolidarisch verh lt muss mit einer solchen entscheidung rechnen
146565 was seine wirtschafts und ordnungspolitischen vorstellungen angeht gibt es viele bereinstimmungen mit der union das ist richtig aber ob sein herz jetzt f r die union schl gt das muss herr clement selbst entscheiden

146572 it has been in advanced discussions with british energy there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy a further announcement will be made when appropriate
146573 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
146574 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit
146575 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
146576 unless we occupy space in those platforms the company will be and other companies in the traditional media space will be marginalized

146593 i had a banner of saad hariri sunni head of the march 14 aligned future movement outside
146594 we hope the international community will not allow syria back here syria is causing unrest to facilitate hezbollah but we trust that the us will support a democratic and free lebanon
146595 we are awaiting the iranian response to the american and european incentives on the nuclear issue if iran plays along hotspots may cool off
146596 regarded as politically dead but has been revived by his alliance with hezbollah
146597 westerners misunderstand our mou understanding with hezbollah the shiites are a pillar of lebanon and they have chosen hezbollah as their main representative and we are working with hezbollah on the basis that the reasons for hezbollah bearing arms must be addressed as part of a national dialogue before any progress can be made on this issue

146600 as far north as hudson bay canada and as far south as lima peru
146601 to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack on the united states requiring a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union
146602 my fellow citizens let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out
146603 it was established pretty convincingly by milton friedman and proved beyond all doubt in the inflationary episodes of the 1970s and 1980s that if you want to bring inflation under control you must set interest rates at a margin above the current inflation level
146604 mommy something big and ugly ate daddy and it is looking at us and licking its lips
146605 the overall lesson is as usual bearish almost all the world has abandoned proper anti inflationary discipline and is destined to suffer a period of high inflation and recession in the coming years
146606 countries like people behave dangerously when their mood turns dark
146607 the credit crunch is in part the consequence of a flawed regulatory system lax monetary policy allowed americans to build up debts and fueled a housing bubble that had to burst eventually
146608 corrupt congressional scumbags getting corrupt federal reserve scumbags to act irresponsibly stupid to implement bizarre impossible laughable neo keynesian econometric theories by creating a continuous flood of money and credit so that an unfolding bust would be reversed and they could all make a lot of money and their friends would make a lot of money when the economy again booms under such an onslaught of new money but which will cause horrendous inflation in consumer prices and people will get grumpy as hell but about which we wont talk at all and well pretend that suffering and misery inflicted by higher prices doesnt exist in reality because it doesnt exist in their stupid stupid stupid little econometric models
146609 the abolition of the central bank is just a major first step but it is a necessary first step
146610 millions of americans were made loans beyond their ability to pay
146611 we need to help them stay in their homes including by converting the home mortgage deduction into a cashable tax credit and creating a homeowners chapter 11 an expedited way to restructure their liabilities
146612 why is columbia staffing itself with people like this and what is the real value of a degree from columbia given their faculty
146613 once the party has chosen a new leader i will resign from my post as prime minister to enable them to put together a new government quickly and efficiently
146614 subject to a wave of investigations examinations and criticism immediately after being elected
146615 if he said good morning to me i wouldnt believe it was morning until i went to the window to check
146616 there is certainly a chance of putting together a coalition
146617 the big question is whether we will be able to get the budget passed with the world economy struggling we will have to keep the budget tight and so it will depend on whether a party like shas understands this the word child allowances is just a word you can always call it something else
146618 the chance of a new government being formed is very low
146619 the smell of elections is in the air and so when it comes to the coalition negotiations no party will want to be seen to be compromising thats because they know elections could be just around the corner and they might not be judged so kindly by their voters if they do
146620 she will say that we have to move forward on this front and that we have to go to the people in an election and win their support
146621 he will say he can form a broad government and that with israel facing serious security issues now is not the time for elections
146622 as long as i remain at my post i will not stop trying to continue to bring the negotiations between us and our neighbors to a successful conclusion
146623 he has lost the support of parliament and of the people he no longer has legitimacy
146624 we syria and israel desire to recognize each other and end the state of war
146625 here then is a grand thing on offer let us sit together let us make peace let us end once and for all the state of war
146626 atomstroyexport russias nuclear power equipment and service equipment monopoly is ready to provide turkey with a project for the construction of a nuclear power plant npp that will be less expensive and more reliable than its american counterparts such npps will help turkey to consolidate its position in the regional energy market especially considering irans nuclear energy problems moscow has long been hinting to ankara that it is best to give priority to economic expediency especially in the energy industry
146627 turkey is living a tense situation and we very much hope that the decision by the court will contribute to restore political stability the court has rendered an opinion and were going to continue to work with this government we work quite well with them
146628 turkey and erdogan becoming a functional and effective actor in the issues topping the international agenda currently is of special importance in turkish internal politics
146629 this verdict is a serious warning i hope the party akp draws the necessary lessons from this
146630 when we go to bed we dont want to worry what kind of turkey we will face in the morning a highly esteemed member of our community was subjected to treatment reminiscent of the coup era which deeply offends us we dont approve of this

146633 for china doing well in the olympic games is an opportunity to establish international prestige and earn face on the world stage since sporting achievement is indicative of the level of a nations development we feel we could change the worlds impression regarding china by performing well at the olympics
146634 if our bodies are not strong how can we attain our goals and make ourselves respected
146635 suitable to the physiques and talents of east asian peoples
146636 we are not a real sporting country because we lack a popular base most chinese kids in normal schools are purely focussed on academics and sports are rarely seen as beneficial or important our success in the olympics is artificially engineered from the top
146637 now we the chinese should reconsider our sports value system and also focus on the enjoyment of sports and the spirit of sports rather than merely winning
146638 the whole country excited and helped china gain in confidence
146639 violent extremist movements such as al qaeda and its associates
146640 the united states must strengthen and expand alliances and partnerships
146641 the us alliance system has been a cornerstone of peace and security for more than a generation and remains the key to our success
146642 freedom of action in the global commons and strategic access to important regions of the world to meet our national security needs
146643 the well being of the global economy is contingent on ready access to energy resources
146644 notwithstanding national efforts to reduce dependence on oil current trends indicate an increasing reliance on petroleum products from areas of instability in the coming years not reduced reliance
146645 we as a nation must strengthen not only our military capabilities but also reinvigorate other important elements of national power and develop the capability to integrate tailor and apply these tools as needed
146646 the department of defense has taken on many of these burdens and will need to institutionalize and retain these capabilities but this is no replacement for civilian involvement and expertise
146647 overall the kinds of capabilities we will most likely need in the years ahead will often resemble the kinds of capabilities we need today
146648 what we must guard against is the kind of backsliding that has occurred in the past where if nature takes it course these kinds of capabilities that is counterinsurgency tend to wither on the vine
146649 us predominance in traditional warfare is not unchallenged but is sustainable for the medium term given current trends
146650 the reality that conventional and strategic force modernization programs are strongly supported in the services and in the congress
146651 for the foreseeable future the strategic environment will be defined by a global struggle against a violent extremist ideology that seeks to overturn the international state system
146652 iran and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle
146653 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
146654 for these reasons arguably the most important component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
146655 china is one ascendant state with the potential for competing with the united states
146656 for the foreseeable future we will need to hedge against chinas growing military modernization and the impact of its strategic choices upon international security
146657 retreat from democracy and its increasing economic and political intimidation of its neighbors give cause for concern
146658 we shall seek to anchor china and russia as stakeholders in the international system
146659 similarly we look to india to assume greater responsibility as a stakeholder commensurate with its growing economic military and soft power

146664 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
146665 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
146666 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
146667 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible

146669 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
146670 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
146671 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like

146712 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
146713 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
146714 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
146715 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
146716 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
146717 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
146718 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

146721 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

146725 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
146726 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
146727 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

146741 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

146759 its friday in boston lets throw on jeans and t shirt and do this thing
146760 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
146761 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
146762 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
146763 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
146764 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
146765 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
146766 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
146767 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
146768 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
146769 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
146770 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
146771 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
146772 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
146773 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
146774 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
146775 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
146776 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

146779 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
146780 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
146781 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
146782 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
146783 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
146784 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
146785 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
146786 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
146787 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
146788 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
146789 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
146790 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
146791 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
146792 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
146793 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
146794 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
146795 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
146796 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
146797 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
146798 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
146799 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
146800 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
146801 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
146802 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
146803 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
146804 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
146805 we still want to add a striker the wayne andrews fitness situation is ongoing and well assess that as it goes on

146844 she seems in good form but we are hoping for more group one black type for her really it is a very tough race
146845 i think she travels so well over a mile that we expect her to see this trip out and it will give us a guide to other options
146846 but i know sir michael is happy with her over that trip as well as a mile
146847 a group one win for these fillies is worth so much but when you are lucky enough to have a filly of this quality to run in these type of races you run them
146848 we will be pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game
146849 as you rightly say its a reunion with steve and we are looking forward to it
146850 when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
146851 im assuming people will say arsenal are one of the strongest seeded teams and he might have been hoping for someone else but thats what the draw brought us and we get on with it
146852 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
146853 all the speed horses like borderlescott look to be on the stands side so thats where i wanted to be
146854 he needs a good gallop and when he won here before he missed the break so he needs something to aim at
146855 he just loves this track and all i hope is that there isnt too much of the wet stuff before saturday
146856 he seems as well as ever and hes certainly as well as he was last year
146857 whether i picked the right side or not we will have to wait and see but he is the pace anyway so im not too worried about that
146858 he will run his race whatever happens whether there is something well handicapped that will come and do him we will see but its obviously a hard race to win
146859 he has come out of the ascot race fine and to be honest he didnt have much of a race that day
146860 i cant understand why he ran so badly but he definitely came back uncomfortable in himself then later on he was back to normal
146861 the seven furlongs definitely wasnt to blame as he wouldnt have won at any stage
146862 he told favre and his agent james bus cook that the deal was on the table regardless of whether favre decided to come back
146863 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphys at least trying
146864 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end my intentions have been to play and with green bay they say no so i still want to play in this division for obvious reasons which i made clear to management if they wont let me play in green bay let me play against you
146865 i only want to play for the packers vikings bear or lions but if they want to pay me 20 million not to i just might take them up on it
146866 a n nfl source who wanted the packers side to be explained said murphys financial offer was wrongly being portrayed as a bribe
146867 die hamburg freezers sind sehr schnell zu einer festen gr e in der hamburger sportwelt geworden gerne setzen wir unsere erfolgreiche zusammenarbeit mit dem eishockeyclub fort wir w nschen den spielern und den fans f r die neue spielsaison weiterhin viel erfolg und freude

146871 a well used tool by webmasters looking to increase the interactive features of their site and get to know their visitors better
146872 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
146873 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
146874 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
146875 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
146876 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
146877 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
146878 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
146879 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
146880 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
146881 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
146882 act swiftly to get to the bottom of the scandal and immediately punish the guilty
146883 the sc must show no hesitation whatsoever in pursuing this controversy the entire judiciarys reputation is tarnished by this scandal and the swiftness within which the sc responds will determine whether the damage is temporary and minimal or if it will be massive and irreparable
146884 the sc must respond with clear and convincing resoluteness by dismissing from the service the ca justices involved in the irregularities if the evidence warrants it
146885 kung sino ang nag offer ng bribe kay justice sabio dapat ihabla kasi krimen yon e
146886 ang sama ng dating sa taongbayan because kumbaga right at the doorstep na ng supreme court ito e its not only the national but also the international reputation of the judiciary could be compromised
146887 of course my god when you say that the second highest level of the judiciary in the philippines is corrupt and bribable whos going to be safe investing here or even travelling here
146888 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
146889 empowering isabela voters to reclaim their democratic right to elect leaders of their own choosing and to contribute as full partners in their own development
146890 if people find it truthful we also print that so where is the bias
146891 onl ang arranger ng 5 billion peso syndicated loan i dont know exactly what it means but the arranger is onl consulting something
146892 like the fertilizer scam itong swine scam yung baboy ginagamit para mababoy ag taong bayan
146893 kung siya ginagawa niya yun ako hindi trapo lang ang nagpapapansin
146894 ito yatang administrasyon na ito mahilig sa tong pats bakit kailangan pa ng arranger samatala bank to bank yan government bank to government bank landbank at quedancor ay government banks naman
146895 i regret she might have been misinformed in banking there are terms not used by layman i dont know where shes coming from but i presume shes been minsinformed
146896 if i get invited to the senate we can explain this as ive said this is all aboveboard
146897 my brother is clean its unfair he can answer the accusations i am not his keeper i hope jamby is not shooting off from her mouth just to get public attention
146898 kung gfi government financial institutions to gfi bakit may p100 million that will be paid by taxpayers
146899 marami pang hidden treasures that we expect to unearth from the 2004 deals
146900 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
146901 there is still a chance the government could sell its stake in san miguel this year there are ongoing talks with farmers and i might announce something in the next two to three weeks
146902 we are now talking as to how the proceeds will be booked whether it will go directly to the farmers or first pass the treasury then to the farmers

146905 at the end of this course you should have a good overview about the opportunities offered by the internet to re invigorate democracy and civil society as well as the current state of the art in digital democracy together with an understanding of current research that should enable you to critically evaluate claims about the promise of the internet for a more participative democracy
146906 some men dont want anything logical like money some men just want to watch the world burn

146909 warning spyware detected on your computer install an antivirus or spyware remover to clean your computer
146910 windows is restarting because the remote procedure call rpc caused an error
146911 there is a hard core of rovers fans who want robbo to do well but think hes had it cant believe weve lost brad and bentley in the one window
146912 i heard about the group on the radio and before i knew it i was kind of addicted
146913 were one of the few families to keep bringing the same child back for summer visits
146914 some children from belarus have been tested and have 400 times the radiation that we have in our bodies
146915 people dont realize this because you cant see the radiation but its a continuous vicious cycle because what they are eating and drinking is radiated it will take 400 to 500 years for the radiation to be gone from their land
146916 if they can get treatment each year it helps them nadias immune system is also down so when she gets sick it takes her longer than my kids to recover
146917 theyre more breakable because of the radiation and we can get sick really easily
146918 im very happy i got involved in the program when i did and i would like to keep coming
146919 the people in canada are really friendly and i think its great i like everything about it
146920 really excited but also scared a bit about the plane trip
146921 language was no problem because nadia was very willing to learn and she caught on to english very quickly
146922 everything about life in canada was amazing to her when she first arrived she was swimming within six hours and going to the grocery store was an amazing adventure for her
146923 grocery stores were different for me because there was more stuff
146924 there was a lot more to choose from when i was here i ate pizza and lasagna which i had never tried before
146925 our food is different its very hard to make and takes a long time
146926 its very different from when i see joanne make supper in 30 minutes
146927 its fun to see nadia is growing up and contributing to the family
146928 shes very mature and was even quite mature when she came the first time she comes from a very different lifestyle that requires her to mature quicker
146929 camping was pretty good and it was fun going on the behemoth at canadas wonderland this year thats my favourite ride
146930 i have also enjoyed just spending time with joanne and her family
146931 its exposed my children to how she lives and made then aware of how lucky they are
146932 radiation is very hard to explain to kids but when nadia went to the dentist and had several teeth pulled because of the radiation they realized quickly that she was coming here for her health i feel they are very fortunate to have this exposure and hopefully it will make them want to help people in the future
146933 its a thrill to see her each year and we just pick up where we left off its always thrilling when summer comes because we get nadia and i have a second daughter for the summer
146934 dios te est llamando est is a un click de estar con l
146935 neither side wants to show that it is losing face or that it is caving in or appeasing the other side but both sides are interested in finding a way out of this conundrum
146936 the iranian reply should come in the next few days
146937 the situation today is that we want a clear reply to the question solana asked in geneva
146938 for the moment the iranian response has not been clear enough
146939 will evaluate every situation individually and take actions as appropriate
146940 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
146941 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
146942 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
146943 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
146944 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
146945 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
146946 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
146947 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
146948 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
146949 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
146950 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
146951 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further
146952 one thing that should not be allowed is the glorification in song or story of what was mean and nasty and dirty
146953 there is always the risk of the re emergence of a cyclical pattern as a generation of young people who have not experienced the actuality the horror and the cost of violence react against the ineffectiveness of politics and politicians their predecessors having been persuaded to turn away from violence on the promise that politics could deliver
146954 if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him
146955 rosary beads a priests collar and a bible or breviary
146956 likely to cause offence contrary to taste and decency guidelines
146957 wayne was interviewed by police in connection with an alleged minor offence involving a paparazzi photographer who had been persistently invading his and coleens privacy throughout the evening
146958 this included the photographer following the couple into a restaurant from which he had to be evicted
146959 we are proud that this distinguished son of ghana deems it proper to lend his name to the university of our country
146960 we trust that having him would add greater credibility to the university and as an institution we will do him proud in all our activities we invite the country at large to accept his appointment and rejoice with us
146961 theres nothing like a total eclipse no experience youll ever have compares to standing under the moons shadow in the daytime seeing planets and bright stars not to mention the suns corona
146962 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
146963 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
146964 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
146965 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
146966 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
146967 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
146968 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
146969 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
146970 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes
146971 ive had some colorful personalities on my clubs like david wells and jimmy leyritz if you feel somebodys going to help your club youve got to find a way to make it work and thats my job its a challenge but i look forward to it
146972 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them

146977 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the u s did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
146978 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
146979 what the u s wants is a revamp especially among the isis units which deal with areas along the afghan border additionally the u s wants to see new structures in place for closer oversight on people in the field basically within the isi there has to be a strong internal affairs unit of a kind

146988 newcastle west has been very badly hit by this flooding the people of the town have had their lives turned upside down overnight peoples homes and vehicles have been severely damaged and it will be quite some time before newcastle west recovers from this flooding
146989 i am calling on minister mansergh and his office of public works to get involved in dealing with the flooding as a matter of urgency we badly need official assessments of the flooding and damage to be taken so we can start working on action to address and limit the damage as soon as possible
146990 i am also calling on the government to provide relief aide to those residents whose homes businesses and vehicles have been badly damaged
146991 we all want to see newcastle west returned to normal as soon as possible in the meantime however its vital that we are doing everything we can to minimise any potential damage and to alleviate the flooding as a matter of haste
146992 seit fr her kindheit verbrachte ich die meiste zeit in balletts len doch eine starke sehnsucht nach mehr freiheit nach dem ursprung nach der reinen freude am tanzen lie sich nicht mehr unterdr cken eine starke affinit t zu stlichen lebenslehren und verschiedenen energiearbeiten f hrten mich zu qi gong und zu einer ausbildung als yoga lehrerin der sivananda yoga zentren die ich sehr genoss
146993 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
146994 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
146995 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
146996 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
146997 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
146998 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
146999 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
147000 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
147001 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
147002 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
147003 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
147004 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
147005 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
147006 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
147007 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
147008 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
147009 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical its a very different type of system
147010 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
147011 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
147012 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream

147129 the goal of the organization is to have a competent and professional group of armed volunteers ready to respond to a threat at a moments notice in any area where jews reside

147132 because historically there has been less anti semitism than in other countries but there have been incidents neo nazi terrorist attacks arab terrorist attacks jews have to be vigilant

147135 the average american is friendly to jews but were worried about those individuals on the periphery of society
147136 we realized there is a need for this kind of organization and as israeli combat veterans living in the us we have the skills and ability to respond to this

147221 is there any evidence that the author of this poem actually saw
147222 not really any specific evidence the lines about the wall being marked with lichen stained with red have sometimes been seen as specific description of an actual place rather than an imaginative or literary based description but no one knows a specific site
147223 no one even has any plausible candidates and it is not clear when the poem was written even if we know that the exeter book was compiled copied between 950 and 975 its obviously possible for the poems in it to be much older

147244 but whats so novel about the plan is its the first attempt to facilitate loan modifications that entail a reduction in the amount of mortgage debt owed by homeowners before this there was really no effort to do this and i think this is really vital this kind of a write down plan is very important because there are now close to 10 million homeowners that are underwater meaning they owe more than the value of their home to give you context there are 51 5 million homeowners with first mortgages so already closing in on 20 percent of homeowners that are underwater that is a large pool of homeowners that are at significant risk of default
147245 weve got to invest in financial literacy i think a very substantive cause of our current problem is many homeowners dont have a basic understanding of their finances they got mortgages that they did not understand and i think that goes to some significant limitations of our k through 12 educational system i know when i went through high school by the time i got out i knew how to make an omelette but i had no idea how to balance a checkbook or what a cd was or even what the stock market was all about i had to learn that afterwards thats something we should really rethink
147246 if you dont have a problem with your mortgage if youre still making your payments and youre current on your mortgage i think its just a matter of waiting to sit tight the market will find a bottom and it will recover and prices will begin rising by the turn of the decade the market will right itself you need to look through all of this and not panic if your horizon is more than a few years youll be fine for those folks that are having problems with their mortgage now the worst thing to do is nothing there are many options now and you should avail yourself of all of them
147247 i think prices nationwide will continue to decline through next spring theyll be flat for a year after that and by 2010 the spring 2010 selling season i think prices will start to rise by 2011 in most communities this will just be a distant bad memory
147248 its going to be somewhere near 2014 2015 nationwide prices when its all said and done will fall about 25 percent from the peak say you get 4 or 5 percent per annum growth so it really wont be until 2014 until many communities start seeing a return to the previous peak
147249 baltimores been a bit of an enigma i keep thinking that it should be comparable to the national housing downturn and i still think that will be the case when its all said and done it just seems to have entered into the downturn more slowly and prices havent fallen as far as i anticipated the market is not good but its not quite as bad as i expected at this point but of course the storys still being written
147250 i think the economy may be holding up a little bit better meaning the job market a lot of that may be related to health care educational services those are industries that are holding tough still adding jobs and i think thats providing a floor to the job market and to housing demand i just think some of the excesses that are plaguing california florida and even northern virginia are not quite as significant theres been subprime lending but not quite as much theres been overbuilding but not quite as much theres been speculation but just not quite as much
147251 its helpful but baltimore is a big economy even something as big as this is relatively small in the context of the size of the economy and the housing market that were talking about the most important thing for housing is affordability so prices have to fall ultimately to be consistent with incomes and rents otherwise the market will never really find its grove it may be the case that prices dont fall as much as weve anticipated because of brac but fundamentally prices have to be low enough that enough people can afford to buy the home and so far that affordability is still elusive
147252 with the advent of technologies like rich internet applications rias both flex powered and ajax driven the iphone adobe air html 5 and google gears web applications are making their way to more mobile devices desktops and yes browsers than ever before

147280 i would have liked to go farther but i dont think i could have handled it
147281 just because i couldnt connect with the songs i really had a hard time when we picked it up to two songs i wasnt committing to either one and i couldnt connect you need time for that
147282 i just showed enough potential that i could potentially be somebody im very much what the show was originally about im kind of as raw as it gets
147283 jeez i didnt know it was sung by a cat
147284 song selection and the pressure has really increased with two songs and preparing for the finale so in that sense it does feel kind of good to be done with that but i was welcoming the challenge as well
147285 we always say this show brings everything to the surface that might be an issue for you and that one is certainly one of them but i worked through it and at times had to work through it in a very public way
147286 id like to keep trying to do school while i work on music i think school is really important it was my main priority before this because i wasnt sure if i was going to get anywhere with music even if music does turn out to go somewhere for me youll never know how long it can last so i just want to have something that can back me up on that im still looking at options and careers id be interested in the future
147287 lately i find the ear nose throat doctor really interesting it would take a lot of education but its something that really interests me its something that helps people whove had the same problems as me ive had so many issues with that stuff so it would be great to study into that more and be able to help out with all those problems
147288 i so do not want to deal with the drama of a relationship right now i just want to focus on music
147289 yeah my dads a dick man i hate him okay are you ready to drive me home dad
147290 i got too many bad comments from the judges to keep me there
147291 and at this point in the game you cant have had too many bad comments to be in the finals i made peace with it i couldnt be happier right now
147292 it will probably be a rock record but i think thats a pretty vague generalization i just want to make a record that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up a record thats going to stand out on its own long after im gone if i can do that then im set im ready to get back into the creative process of writing songs and basically baring my soul on these records
147293 gosh i cant believe where im at and isnt this amazing
147294 and now its time for the timex judges comments remember it can take a licking and keep on ticking and so can these contestants
147295 i wanted to show another side and show some kind of progression
147296 simon just killed kristys chances by calling her performance in a roundabout way karaoke hell
147297 all he does is take a popular song and make it sound like rock
147298 i would love to perform on that american idol i dont really go and ask them a lot for stuff theyve done so much for me and my career already i wouldnt have the career i do without them maybe some people should call up idol and tell them they want to see old bo bice play on stage and they might let me
147299 he sings technically well but does so more and more like a grade school talent competition than a consummate performer
147300 im just ready to make a record and just enjoy life in general and i dont know go to the beach do the things i used to do in my everyday life

147318 there will be lots of doubts in his own mind about the injuries
147319 he has never had those types of problems before in his career but he has had a full pre season under his belt and i am sure he just wants to get out there and play games
147320 i am just hoping he doesnt suffer any more problems
147321 rio ferdinand has grown into that role in his absence and thats why he is being touted as an england captain but you can never have too many leaders out there
147322 every england manager has had him in their team during his career so that shows you how good a player he is
147323 he has been a targeted by the press and when he had one iffy season they jumped on it
147324 but you only have to ask fellow professionals what they think of him and they will tell you what a good player he is
147325 hes been a terrific professional and all his life is about football it is difficult to survive up there with the best at a top club but he has done it
147326 im sure hes questioned himself while hes been injured and when you are so passionate about the sport it is frustrating to have it taken away
147327 the things that made ole succeed as a player will make him succeed in management

147334 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
147335 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
147336 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
147337 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
147338 a israeli tank came in looking for a couple of kids and he threw a single stone as it passed by they put two bullets in him one in the chest and the other in the leg his friends started to carry him to try and get him to hospital but he was dead
147339 we were shopping then my son came dashing up to me dont go into the square mum they just shot a boy
147340 my mother told me she didnt care what i brought back just bring the photo of dad you see
147341 my father and my three brothers were all killed in shatila camp when i was three years old and only my sister and i are left jane my house was like powder the whole camp is like powder it has been razed to the ground and we will never see my fathers face again
147342 we were so desperate we decided to risk the snipers and run to the main street to see what we could find we saw loaves of bread lying scattered in between dead bodies im sorry jane
147343 you are not going to like what im going to say next but we were starving and i didnt care about the bodies and the sticky pools of blood on the road i picked out the whitest bits of bread some of it full of blood i just didnt care i took it back to my family i was in a state of shock i couldnt speak to anyone for days after that
147344 we have got to stop sounding miserable about ourselves and sounding as if we have been treated unfairly
147345 i think we can win the next election and weve got to do that i think in two ways set out a very positive clear vision about how our values are right for the country and how we can take the country forward
147346 we have got to stop sounding miserable about ourselves and sounding as if we have been treated unfairly we are not doing well enough its what the voters have said to us
147347 we are nearly on our side if we get out of this it will be a miracle
147348 we heard stuff crashing everywhere we heard screaming things were a bit of a mess casino machines fell over
147349 last night when the ship rolled she and her party were in the casino they were injured as a result of machines coming loose and rolling into them when in the dining hall the ship rolled again and she said all the crockery went flying
147350 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth go therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all things that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age
147351 and we know that all things work together for the good of those who love god to those who are the called according to his purpose for those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren moreover whom he predestined these he also called whom he called these he also justified and whom he justified these he also glorified
147352 we have made it clear that we think coal should be part of the mix in the future we are absolutely determined as soon as we can to develop clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage ccs
147353 we know that china is building coal fired power stations and the real prize is to develop technology so that the ccs technology can be fitted on to coal power plants in places like china
147354 while i fervently believe that climate change is the biggest pre eminent challenge for our planet in the 21st century we also have to worry about energy supply and energy security and we have to go in for diversity and therefore coal needs to be part of the mix
147355 although for some protesters the great challenge is britain with no coal at all just washing our hands of it the challenge for us in the uk government is to be one of those lead nations developing clean coal technologies that will benefit the globe the planet as a whole
147356 we dont feel we should be burning coal at this stage in the climate crisis for the government to be considering building a whole new fleet of coal fired power stations is real madness
147357 we need the government to put in incentives and frameworks that will allow companies like e on to opt for renewable options
147358 why are we going for the most polluting option when low carbon tried and tested technologies like wind power like solar power already exist and could be rolled out
147359 kent has a massive role to play in delivering renewable energy if you look at the london array the offshore wind farm and youve also got the kentish flats
147360 theres huge potential in kent for both investment in renewable energy but also in the economy and kent really could be at the heart of our fight against climate change
147361 the uk is facing a major challenge at the moment weve got a third of our power stations closing in the next 10 to 20 years so we need to fill the gap so we can keep the lights on
147362 kingsnorth power station is going to be closing by the end of 2015 what we want to do is replace it with something that is much cleaner
147363 what we are talking about is technology that will allow us to produce electricity from coal that is far cleaner than we have ever seen before in the uk
147364 its a 20 improvement in efficiency that means 20 less carbon emissions which can only be a good thing
147365 we believe that carbon capture and storage is absolutely critical if we are going to tackle global climate change
147366 what we want to do is demonstrate this new technology at kingsnorth so that one day it can be exported around the world to all coal fired power stations
147367 although the industry is talking about fitting carbon capture and storage nobody knows how soon this can be done
147368 so what the committee is saying is that the government should not allow any new coal fired power stations to be built unless there is an absolute condition that they wont operate without ccs
147369 there are other ways of producing electricity we could do with more wind power particularly off shore in the south east we could do probably with more nuclear power as well
147370 coal is the dirtiest option and environmentally disastrous if we allow coal fired power stations to be built without carbon capture and storage
147371 if we do not move to low carbon electricity generation in this country we will face a terrible problem in 10 years time and pay an even bigger price when we have to solve it then

147392 tidak boleh melakukan perbuatan hukum atas menggunakan hak milik orang lain tanpa seizinnya
147393 mayoritas ulama dari kalangan mazhab maliki syafi i dan hambali berpendapat bahwa hak cipta atas ciptaan yang orsinil dan manfaat tergolong harta berharga sebagaimana benda jika boleh dimanfaatkan secara syara hukum islam
147394 berdasarkan hal bahwa hak kepengarangan adalah hak yang dilindungi oleh syara hukum islam atas dasar qaidah istishlah tersebut mencetak ulang atau men copy buku tanpa seizing yang sah dipandang sebagai pelanggaran atau kejahatan terhadap hak pengarang dalam arti bahwa perbuatan tersebut adalah kemaksiatan yang menimbulkan dosa dalam pandangan syara dan merupakan pencurian yang mengharuskan ganti rugi terhadap hak pengarang atas naskah yang dicetak secara melanggar dan zalim serta menimbulkan kerugian moril yang menimpanya
147395 especially the scores we gave away in the first half we upped it in the second half but we never thought it was gone

147411 what turns me on more than anything is when a girl is really into it but for herself if i feel that the girl is really enjoying it but not so that it is good for me but good for them well that just makes me horny as hell because then there is no feeling that you have to act in a certain way so that they know that you appreciate what they are doing sex shouldnt be a favour to be bestowed on your partner but it is a carnal natural thing that should be enjoyed for what it is and if i feel that the girl is thinking in that way also well it makes me horny as hell

147421 caution in using terms such as jihadist islamist and holy warrior as grandiose descriptions
147422 the national counterterrorism center and the department of homeland security have issued memos imposing speech codes
147423 these are precisely the terms that osama bin laden and other terrorist leaders use routinely to describe their actions against the united states we should not let them define this debate and claim a false mantle of legitimacy

147458 if the instrument works as we hope it will be a valuable tool that will enable us to characterize the extent and intensity of incursions of these high co2 waters onto the california shelf and better understand the stresses ecosystems are under
147459 by observing ph over long time periods ocean scientists will be able to determine the processes that control seawater ph its natural range of variability and how ph is changing as co2 is absorbed by the oceans
147460 whats the intensity and frequency of these events is it a few days now and then or do acidic conditions persist over a protracted period of time
147461 we fear that these intermittent acidic conditions could pose severe problems for organisms and their associated ecosystems but as yet we just dont know

147469 literature is about that it is about the stranger in you curiosity about others
147470 it is not just what we know it is how we know it it is the scientific method the critical method of organized doubt that too is an immensely valuable education equipment for life
147471 computers have no place in primary and secondary school they teach the culture of the readily available and not the pain and effort of culture
147472 the most important technologies are threatening the human species knowledge could destroy us
147473 can we behave as a collective well enough to survive do people have the right to know everything
147474 and i realized that i could easily have been in her place
147475 and his body was thrown into a cistern a woman could not do that
147476 but they sort of forgot about me the women were happy that i was interested in their stories because nobody wants to hear about them theyre considered bad women and people think they should be shunned
147477 she tried to show indifference but she was feeling bad and hurt she had the feeling she was going to be killed and nothing mattered to her maybe thats one of the reasons that she let me film her unveiled and that she smoked on camera at the same time though she was hoping we might help her
147478 he didnt know that she was a minor at the time of the crime there was a second mitigating factor one of aminas daughters was killed in a car accident and under islamic law this lifted the death sentence
147479 where did this man get such wisdom and mighty deeds is he not the carpenter s son is not his mother named mary and his brothers james joseph simon and judas are not his sisters all with us where did this man get all this
147480 a prophet is not without honor except in his native place and in his own house
147481 those who have hope must live different lives cf spe salvi 2 the world needs this witness who can deny that the present moment is a crossroads not only for the church in america but also for society as a whole
147482 i have come to proclaim anew as peter proclaimed on the day of pentecost that jesus christ is lord and messiah risen from the dead seated in glory at the right hand of the father and established as judge of the living and the dead cf acts 2 14ff i have come to repeat the apostles urgent call to conversion and the forgiveness of sins and to implore from the lord a new outpouring of the holy spirit upon the church in this country
147483 let us trust in the spirits power to inspire conversion to heal every wound to overcome every division and to inspire new life and freedom how much we need these gifts and how close at hand they are particularly in the sacrament of penance the liberating power of this sacrament in which our honest confession of sin is met by gods merciful word of pardon and peace needs to be rediscovered and reappropriated by every catholic to a great extent the renewal of the church in america and throughout the world depends on the renewal of the practice of penance and the growth in holiness which that sacrament both inspires and accomplishes
147484 in every time and place the church is called to grow in unity through constant conversion to christ whose saving work is proclaimed by the successors of the apostles and celebrated in the sacraments this unity in turn gives rise to an unceasing missionary outreach as the spirit spurs believers to proclaim the great works of god and to invite all people to enter the community of those saved by the blood of christ and granted new life in his spirit
147485 it is a pleasure to listen to your sermons you forget yourself and preach jesus christ
147486 these people will stay under arrest until the west bank authorities release mohamed ghazal a member of the political leadership and his comrades
147487 how much government do we need theres not a smoker in america that doesnt understand that smoking isnt good for you
147488 the minority leader said when is enough enough well cigarettes one of the most dangerous products on sale today are not regulated at all
147489 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
147490 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
147491 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
147492 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
147493 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body
147494 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
147495 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
147496 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
147497 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal

147511 back in 1995 he and i along with a few other close friends were just a group of guys that wanted to ride our motorcycles across the country
147512 we found out that we could raise some money for charity while doing it and the kyle petty charity ride was born while it had my name on it click was a driving force behind the ride
147513 words cannot describe what click baldwin has meant to me my family and the victory junction gang camp
147514 there has never been a more giving human being he was more than a friend he was like a brother to me
147515 the parade of ships is very touching moving and inspiring for americans who have a chance to see the parade
147516 it was nice to tap into things you dont get to see every day i appreciate so much the service of young men and women who have a purpose greater than ourselves i wouldnt miss this
147517 seafair is a long standing festival that goes back to 1941 here in seattle and throughout its history they have made a point of including the navy and ships in the festival
147518 the parade of ships marked the official arrival of the fleet
147519 the parade of ships is important because its an increase in public awareness
147520 by increasing public awareness people are asking questions to me and other dignitaries around here as to what the navy is about and why they are here i think its a good thing just to be able to talk to the public
147521 the parade of ships was great i enjoyed every minute of it
147522 i havent been on a ship like this before and it gave me a chance to see our service men and women in action and it gives me a perspective of what they have to do in giving service to our country its great to be able to meet some of these sailors
147523 it is as close to live action as we can get in a training environment
147524 these scenarios range from small boat boardings to communications with unidentified ships it tests our ability to respond
147525 comptuex helped us prepare for jtfex and because of fleet synthetic training we were able to have pier side exercises with the other ships in our strike group
147526 we held classes for the crew so they could be trained for various duties including standing watch and visit board search and seizure exercises
147527 the crew has trained long and hard for jtfex and we look forward to seeing positive results
147528 getting freedom underway is a significant step in the ships steady progress toward entering the fleet
147529 freedom has overcome many challenges to reach this important milestone lcs 1 will add tremendous capabilities to the fleet for our sailors
147530 this is a major staff sustainment exercise concerning our ability to operate as a jtf
147531 we do exercises like this since we are a u s joint forces command designated jtf capable headquarters and we report as such through the defense readiness reporting system said navy capt steven zaricor cjtf 950 director of operations
147532 this was a pretty complex ambitious exercise considering this was a major certification exercise for the carrier strike group expeditionary strike group and for second fleet
147533 at the operational level of war its important to fuse all effects you have to pool all services and abilities to have a jtf with expertise and command and control to effectively fight a joint war
147534 i was impressed with what they were able to do
147535 if you need to get a staff forward with no footprint you can reach back to your main support in the rear
147536 i think we had a good solid joint team both here and back at norfolk
147537 an obvious advantage to this is the admiral can be here with a large part of his staff while back in virginia a large group is getting work done in support of expeditionary operations
147538 its a challenge definitely one of the big learning points is how to do distributive ops and weve demonstrated we can do it
147539 working in a joint arena makes it more difficult but once you get the processes and procedures its easier people brought a lot of experience to this exercise
147540 having these guys bring the expertise that a navy centric staff doesnt have pays big dividends
147541 we have some very talented mid grade officer majors lieutenant colonel types and we plug them into key billets in our staff
147542 the biggest advantage of having interaction with the other services is seeing how other services operate
147543 the great part is everyone understands there are different cultures and works together to bridge that gap
147544 combined joint and interagency operations are here to stay the more we can learn about each others culture service and history the better prepared we will be to defend american interests and freedom when required
147545 will make at least a few high profile appearances around the rest of the country
147546 the markets attention will turn today friday to the release of the us

147564 we have a situation where the biofuels compete very seriously with food for poor people driving up food prices
147565 the price of corn is very relevant for poor people because they spend 50 70 of their money on food
147566 you look at the price of food and the packaging costs more than our product in it
147567 the transportation has added inordinately to the price of corn and so have wages costs there are factors other than the cost of grain
147568 at the level of consumption we are at today we can t produce enough
147569 if we use every acre we can t produce enough we can t produce ourselves out of an oil problem with plant fuels when it comes to consumption we need to do better
147570 despite the likelihood that the rumours contributed to the fall in the share price the fsa has not uncovered evidence that they were spread as part of a concerted attempt by individuals to profit by manipulating the share price
147571 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hbos share price
147572 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day

147592 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country

147609 the network was beginning to air new episodes of some of their shows the eps were shot before the strike and it looked like the network wasnt going to hold them back and air them after the walkout was over now it looks like they are so those of you who were starting to get used to the idea of new smallville and supernatural episodes for instance are going to have to watch some more reruns for a while

147630 in places like where i grew up and where i worked there are incredibly high hiv and std rates
147631 this card opens up the conversation for people to talk about it
147632 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
147633 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
147634 this is a great opportunity for us to show chinese readers what first class journalism we can deliver
147635 but of course we will also want to check if the site is still available after the olympics have ended

147643 i can go in there with a clean slate and go into camp and try to impress some people
147644 it stretched on for a little bit and there were two teams talking and then it came down to montreal my agent liked what they had to offer so we signed a deal
147645 going into training camp everyones goal is to make the big club but if things dont work out and i do end up getting sent down it will be cool to play close to home and close to family and friends
147646 everyones goal is to be a full time nhler and thats what ive been working toward its the same situation ive always been in i have to go in and have a strong camp and try to make an impression thats all i can do on my end is go and play well and then whatever happens happens
147647 i think first impressions are a big thing and this is the first time a lot of their people are going to see me you definitely feel a little added pressure that you have to come in and perform well right off the bat because theres no history there you want to get off to a good start
147648 we know virtually nothing about this art thats the exciting part of this discovery
147649 what we need to do now is to discover how this art relates to other prehistoric features in the landscape
147650 we are talking about very simple and abstract art using circles lines and triangles mostly the designs are pecked into stone in the shape of simple cups and rings
147651 given the worlds reliance on coal we need to find ways to make it a cleaner energy source were delighted to be working with our partners in china to help find solutions to this global challenge
147652 in a recent visit to china prime minister kevin rudd said that china was the largest consumer of coal in the world and australia was the worlds largest exporter of coal as such australia and china should work together develop low emissions coal technologies
147653 it will allow pcc technology to be progressed in the chinese energy sector which will have a much greater impact than operating in australia alone
147654 using common and affordable elements and a glass of water these chemists may have given us a future way to efficiently obtain oxygen by splitting water
147655 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism

147664 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
147665 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
147666 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
147667 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
147668 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
147669 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
147670 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
147671 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
147672 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
147673 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
147674 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
147675 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
147676 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way

147680 i find it particularly interesting that fish are capable of such a sophisticated behavior the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur
147681 future studies will need to evaluate the potential for male mate choice copying and deception in natural populations because male mate choice copying cannot be evolutionarily stable if males always have an opportunity to deceive rivals

147690 s k chaturvedi has assumed the charge of chairman and managing director of the company from today
147691 he was a veteran secular leader and his death is a jolt to secular forces
147692 surjeet had made significant contribution to the evolution of indian politics and the communist movement in india he would be missed dearly
147693 we expect more bodies may be trapped under the charred bogies
147694 all of us would participate in the stir along with other like minded mps of other states
147695 in some cases the effects were similar to those achieved with common anti blood pressure drugs
147696 es tut mir so so leid f r das team
147697 ich konnte den felsen nicht sehen er war im schatten einer farm ich habe ihn nicht gesehen ich dachte es w re ein reifenschaden aber als wir dann ber die kuppe kamen sind wir abgeflogen das auto hat sich halb berschlagen es ist nicht gut ich hoffe nur dass wir morgen wieder fahren k nnen um etwas selbstvertrauen zu gewinnen es tut mir so leid f r das team
147698 alle piloten haben diesen felsen in ihrem aufschrieb aber jari matti nicht
147699 ich habe mit jari matti gesprochen aber es war keine besonders lange konversation
147700 er hat einen felsen gerammt es klang als ob der felsen gro wie ein auto war alle piloten haben diesen felsen in ihrem aufschrieb aber jari matti nicht
147701 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
147702 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
147703 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
147704 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
147705 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
147706 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
147707 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
147708 did you not want that yogurt whyd you dump it upside down
147709 im very grateful id already had a child that was breastfed because i had very clear memories of how lovely it is when youre breastfeeding a little baby and they are looking up at you
147710 theres that eye contact that is so critical and tara at this point never looked me in the eye it just didnt feel quite right
147711 in purely practical terms what it has meant is that no matter what health care problems tara has had theyve been covered by insurance
147712 which is a huge blessing because if youre already worried about a little kids health not having to worry about paying for it really helps
147713 i think theyre very fair they come in and ask a lot of questions and their job appears to be to try to be helpful and to get you as much assistance as they possibly can
147714 she said the really key thing to understand is you dont have to worry
147715 the way the swiss government approaches this is that every person who is a swiss citizen has the right to be able to live decently
147716 for me that was just like such a huge wave of relief to have somebody tell you you dont ever have to worry about how your child is going to be cared for
147717 i dont know if this will ever be a reality
147718 my older daughter had great difficulty falling asleep so i would spend two to three hours in bed with her trying to get her to sleep i was literally getting two to three hours of sleep and this would go on for months at a time
147719 you had to stay on top of things you couldnt just expect it to go well
147720 no id have to say i consider myself extremely lucky
147721 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
147722 long long ago my friend came here for business and introduced me to dakar to sell chinese products
147723 i hope i can make a big market in africa in the future and maybe i will have good luck
147724 these people represent a new form of colonialism with an asian face that is coming to africa
147725 the influx of chinese business people onto the streets of dakar is quite a phenomenon
147726 one street the boulevard general de gaulle named after the french wartime leader could be called boulevard mao tse tung because it is dominated by the chinese
147727 when they came to africa three centuries ago they used the barrel of the gun
147728 they came with boats they controlled ports and forts and physically dominated places the chinese did it in a soft way
147729 the advance force that has allowed opening up of new territories including senegal and they were followed up later on by the big companies and then the political leaders
147730 they are very useful in the grand strategy that china is deploying across the world
147731 well see maybe one two three four maybe more if the market is suitable for me maybe i can stay here for a long time
147732 there is no strategic continental approach that african countries have adopted
147733 no think tank no task force no inclusion of chinese language into universities no coordinated approach this should be the role of the african union
147734 its an unbalanced relationship in which china knows what it wants and has a clearly defined agenda
147735 the question indeed is what is africa doing in the face of these challenges
147736 nothing its as if african countries are rushing to china bowl in hand and china naturally is in a best position to take advantage whereas african countries are almost powerless and just expecting china to be the new messiah
147737 china is in a position to be in the heart of africa
147738 and the west they are losing out if africa plays its cards well i think africa has never been in a better position
147739 no matter how hard we tried we couldnt shake it free of the scoop and deliver it to the tega
147740 our excitement is not so much that ice is made of h2o
147741 its what were going to learn about the impurities that are associated with this ice salts minerals and all of the things that are going to tell us about the history and the chance that this is a habitable zone on mars
147742 the civil service process is designed to protect employees from political interference
147743 by stripping civil servants of protections after the fact you undermine the whole notion of civil service protection
147744 theyve been caught with their hand in the ideological cookie jar
147745 the no 1 issue here is confidence among the american people that cases are taken in a way that isnt influenced by political ideology
147746 to turn a flashlight back on the people whove entered and to re evaluate their admission into the department would be extremely difficult
147747 our re creation of pixie hollow and the visual splendor on the ice sets the stage for the magical and diverse cast of disney fairies
147748 audiences will get to meet the fairies live for the first time ever as we open the door to this mystical fairy world deep in the heart of never land and unveil the secrets that lie within
147749 this years festival provides an opportunity for our artists to explore and draw upon the legacies of their history it is also an opportunity to see our stories connect and unite with people of all cultures although our theme is based on the black experience resilience knows no racial boundaries it is my hope that the works presented in afrosolo arts festival 15 will provide inspiration to move past all of the difficulties we face in todays world
147750 shes like a barbecue i put my meat up on her grill
147751 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all of the agencys legal requirements
147752 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
147753 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards
147754 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent
147755 it strengthens the impression that there are good and bad nonproliferators

147764 he shot annapolis yesterday when he declared that there is no possibility of reaching an agreement by the end of the year he destroyed annapolis by declaring that jerusalem is not part of the discussion and today by this resignation probably hes providing the ammunition to kill finally the annapolis process completely olmert is finishing with failures but his biggest failure is that he has proven that up til now there is no partner for peace in israel
147765 it is decided not to ban the party the court decided to impose partial financial penalties the party will not be banned but everybody should evaluate the decision very carefully the decision should be accepted as a very strong warning for akp six court members voted yes four people voted for imposing financial penalties and one person voted for rejection of the case
147766 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
147767 similar to practices in other countries china is acting in accordance with its laws with regards to control of the internet according to chinese law the internet cannot be used to transmit information that is illegal such as promoting the evil cult falun gong or threatening national security so we hope that the media will respect chinese laws and regulations
147768 this is a major step towards serbias place in europe where the country belongs serbia now must face through this trial and through every next trial perhaps of hopefully of general ratko mladic soon to face everything that was done and undertaken in the name of the people of serbia including crimes atrocities and everything else

147771 the mission is to enter gaza without passing through the territory of israel or egypt going from international waters directly into gaza it hasnt been done since 1967 and theres reason to think that no one will interfere with us if we go because israel has said that they no longer occupy gaza so we want to put it to the test

147777 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
147778 i wouldnt even be surprised if that in some polls that you saw a little bit of a dip as a consequence weve been out of the country for a week people are worried about gas prices theyre worried about home foreclosures so the reason that i thought this trip was important was i am convinced that many of the issues that we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad
147779 the conviction gives his victims hope that he will soon be brought to justice for his crimes in haiti that included the murder and rape and other torture of thousands more
147780 we strongly condemn this decision by the defense ministry to allow new settlements in the west bank in the jordan valley this is not the interest of the israeli people and the israeli public to have new settlements while we are having negotiations with the palestinians about having the two states

147834 fusion centers are part of a much larger trend here a trend of our nations movement towards a surveillance society where our every move and our every transaction our every communication is scanned and scrutinized for signs of quote unquote suspicious behavior and that that kind of vision for how to do law enforcement how to stop terrorism becomes a justification for really keeping tabs on all of us in our everyday lives

147881 you shall not make any cuttings in your flesh on account of the dead or tattoo any marks upon you i am the lord
147882 i do not nullify the grace of god for if justification were through the law then christ died to no purpose
147883 christ has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better since it is enacted on better promises for if that first covenant had been faultless there would have been no occasion for a second
147884 the next day he saw jesus coming toward him and said
147885 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
147886 to him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name
147887 you are severed from christ you who would be justified by the law you have fallen away from grace for through the spirit by faith we wait for the hope of righteousness for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail but faith working through love
147888 but now we are discharged from the law dead to that which held us captive so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the spirit
147889 for his sake i have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse in order that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own based on law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness from god that depends on faith
147890 our competence is from god who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant not in a written code but in the spirit for the written code kills but the spirit gives life
147891 you yourselves know how unlawful it is for a jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation but god has shown me that i should not call any man common or unclean
147892 on the first day of every week each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income saving it up so that when i come no collections will have to be made
147893 how is it that you fail to perceive that i did not speak about bread beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees
147894 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you tithe mint and dill and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith
147895 and he called the people to him and said to them
147896 what about christs proclamation that he did not come to abolish the law and the prophets but to fulfil them
147897 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the great and first commandment and a second is like it you shall love your neighbour as yourself on these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets
147898 you have heard that it was said to the men of old you shall not kill and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment but i say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council and whoever says you fool shall be liable to the hell of fire
147899 do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit who is in you whom you have received from god you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honour god with your body
147900 and it shall be to you as a sign on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes that the law of the lord may be in your mouth
147901 it shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes for by a strong hand the lord brought us out of egypt
147902 this one will say i am the lords another will call himself by the name of jacob and another will write on his hand the lords and surname himself by the name of israel
147903 behold i have graven you on the palms of my hands your walls are continually before me
147904 and the lord said to him go through the city through jerusalem and put a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it
147905 henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear on my body the brand marks of jesus
147906 then i saw another angel ascend from the rising of the sun with the seal of the living god and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea saying do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god upon their foreheads
147907 on his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed king of kings and lord of lords

147910 do not for the sake of food destroy the work of god everything is indeed clean but it is wrong for any one to make others fall by what he eats it is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble
147911 byx has failed to show that the forced inclusion of a non christian in their group meetings or other functions will prevent byx from encouraging their christian members in their faith fostering unity with like minded christians and teaching christian leadership

147915 unusually we at arup began the competition process by outlining to the architects what we wanted to achieve technically based on our previous experience with aquatic centres bringing into play a whole gamut of engineering disciplines as swimming pools need to be heated for most of the year we decided that the solution that solved most of the technical problems was an insulated greenhouse diffused natural light would enter through a main steel structure built within a cavity to isolate it from both the corrosive pool hall atmosphere and from the outside arup also reasoned that a transparent form of teflon would be most efficient for such a greenhouse removing the need for a secondary structure and providing better insulation than single glazing the architectural planning team concurrently calculated that the entire square site would be needed to fit all the required facilities into the centre
147916 he suspected nature would provide the answer from living cells to mineral crystals
147917 how can space be partitioned into cells of equal volume with the least area of surface between them
147918 the structural optimization process sized all the steelwork members and their connections
147919 its hard to get people out and paying attention to the election they seem somewhat apathetic
147920 there is a disadvantage in not having the democratic endorsement but im working my way around it
147921 youre supposed to be able to search all kinds of databases to find out the cost of new york state government but ive tried some searches about 3 times and found it to be non functional for the time being
147922 there was some early uproar when facebook first permitted applications about some of the music sharing apps
147923 what ultimately happened then was that the music sharing apps very rapidly were tweaked so that people werent doing any actual file sharing
147924 hasbro certainly couldve saber rattled and pushed the issue with facebook
147925 particularly under the grokster decision from a few years back facebook has to be very careful even if its getting indemnity from the people who are putting applications on the site that indemnity might not amount to much if theres very little there to back it up
147926 in fact in last weeks f8 conference announcement they said they are trying to award and sort out the good applications versus the not so good ones
147927 its posturing but its the way that they are ensuring that theyre not in bed with their application makers for this purpose
147928 strive s to work with developers to correct any issues we discover but when necessary we will act quickly to correct problems and ensure a safe and high quality facebook platform experience for all
147929 i think that this is a questionable area of intellectual property law and its not clear cut
147930 when things arent clear cut you dont necessarily go and cut off peoples access to platforms
147931 the thing is theres 400 000 developers using facebooks platform and theyre trying to find ways to be successful and that means copying games that are going to work
147932 theyre clearly trying to segment quality apps that help the user experience versus ones that dont
147933 if you dont make the problems public the companies dont fix them and the consumers buy shoddy stuff
147934 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them
147935 how does it help the consumer not to tell them that there is a vulnerability
147936 medeco customers have a right to know whether their locks can be compromised
147937 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport we frown on all of that even if its for fun
147938 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
147939 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
147940 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
147941 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
147942 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
147943 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
147944 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
147945 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
147946 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
147947 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years
147948 let them make their security assessments based on how secure they are told the locks are
147949 in previous years ive had big support from the crowd so im looking forward to a good race a good atmosphere and some good weather this weekend
147950 i had run about eight or nine laps and was just up to speed and suddenly i felt the car straightening out
147951 it no longer went where i was steering im not sure what broke but i had no steering and i was heading straight into the wall
147952 but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
147953 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
147954 in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits
147955 when plaintiffs discovered these images rather than using the simple removal option google affords they sued google for invasion of privacy trespass negligence and conversion
147956 the response quotes and expands upon an existing legal opinion to help frame the response
147957 it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy
147958 google respects an individuals right to privacy we have privacy protections built into all of our products
147959 theres something stately about these treasures that actually show their history once regal vehicles that have been left unrestored by their owners
147960 some have sat untouched for decades in barns under tarps or buried in the back of deserted warehouses while others have been lovingly driven around town in each instance theyre unique beautiful and bear witness to the passage of time not only to those who created them but to those who drove them
147961 i couldnt find the car id been dreaming of so i decided to build it myself

147964 something was happening within the church that she didnt approve of
147965 rhoda left the church because of problems that were happening inside the church
147966 so as far as what im hearing its some kind of financial thing
147967 it wouldnt surprise me if her death was part and parcel to the tremendous turmoil involving her former church
147968 despite a tumultuous quarter for companies in the financial sector we are satisfied with the performance of our stock and remain confident in the strength of our institution our balance sheet is well capitalized our asset quality remains high and our loan and investment portfolios are free from sub prime collateral
147969 during the balance of the year we will continue our focus on developing long term personal and commercial banking relationships in southern louisiana upholding asset quality through diligent underwriting and persistent review of the loan portfolio and prudently managing the capital of the corporation in our efforts to maximize long term shareholder value

147974 the company reviewed various alternatives and we concluded that maintaining our corporate headquarters in indiana was optimal for building long term shareholder value
147975 indiana has served our employees well in the past and we believe that the infrastructure and talent pool is present in indiana that will allow our company to continue its strategic plan and expansion efforts
147976 brightpoints decision to remain in indiana and grow its global headquarters here is the latest confirmation that the economic environment we have created is allowing us to compete and win for new job creating investments
147977 we are pleased to be able to provide brightpoint with the space they need for their expanding global operations

147990 even though we lost this morning coach brian crichlow had all the confidence in the world that we could beat dfw
147991 that steal and that layup were pretty much the momentum changer for the game
147992 weve grown a lot since the last time we played them
147993 i was sitting at home doing nothing and all of a sudden a team wants me
147994 latroy gives us another experienced quality arm for our bullpen
147995 we tried to sign him during the offseason and lost out to the yankees but we are happy to have him here for the remainder of the season he gives manager cecil cooper one more weapon to call upon late in the game
147996 it was one of those things where if i ever got the chance to play for the yankees i certainly didnt want to pass up on that opportunity
147997 no disrespect to the astros or anything like that but it was one of those things that i wanted to do at one point in my career and the opportunity presented itself
147998 we ended up getting a deal done for an experienced relief pitcher who we think can go back on the back end and help brocail and sampson and the other guys who weve been using late and help us get the job done
147999 i told myself that i was going to stay in shape
148000 if i got traded i got traded or if i had to wait the full 10 days and get released and then sign with another team that was the way i was going to go i just wanted the chance to pitch again this year
148001 he seemed very pleased with the opportunity hes going to get here
148002 there is always the possibility that something else will happen
148003 but realistically this was the thing thats been teed up for a while here well see what happens in the next couple of hours but there is really nothing hot or active at this point
148004 i have to shoot it sometimes because people play me so tight i have that shot i just have to take it more so i can be consistent
148005 it didnt really matter if i can play im out there no excuses
148006 the most intriguing and impressive winner that ive seen in this race over the years was western pride
148007 he was a special animal and he was able to showcase the riding skills of a local kid like dana whitney
148008 the reason it has become such a great race with national interest is because of the efforts of rose mary williams
148009 shes just a tremendous executive and she knows how to put an event together as well as anyone its just amazing to see all the people there from parking lot attendants to the racing office staff dedicated to her leadership
148010 a variety of artificial turf products were evaluated for risk exposure to lead and the bottom line is parents should not be concerned about harmful levels of lead in artificial turf
148011 this will ensure that there is a level playing field for any company manufacturing synthetic turf in the future
148012 my quick take is that the cpsc study is fatally flawed and were going to continue to pursue our case because lead is a threat to children playing on artificial field
148013 we had to come out hard and attack them before they came out and ran over us
148014 our whole thing is that we win off of team basketball
148015 win lose or draw its a matter of working on some stuff and tweaking some areas we use those tournaments to tweak our stuff to get ready for nike nationals
148016 now im just looking forward to playing for the yankees and maybe i will play against detroit again in the playoffs
148017 hes hitting over 290 i believe and hes been hot so were looking forward to having him
148018 pudge has always wanted to play in new york and detroit felt it needed a relief pitcher so both sides were able to get what they wanted to some degree
148019 its going to be very exciting they are in the race and im ready to do my job
148020 hes been a great player for a long time and i remember the battles we had in texas hes been a world champion
148021 they are in the race and im ready to do my job
148022 another team wants me thats the way i look at it
148023 they the tigers know my reputation they know what type of person i am
148024 hes been throwing the ball great and its great to see the things hes done to make himself better but its a business and you have to understand that
148025 we are robbing peter to play paul so we hope it works out
148026 somewhere sixth seventh inning i told joey girardi i dont know where this is going but dont use farnsworth
148027 first let me say that pudge has done an outstanding job for us
148028 im sure he was very surprised by this but for him this is a good situation hes going to new york city and they are in contention
148029 we think brandon inge can do a fine job at catcher and at the same time weve done some repair to our bullpen
148030 i wanna play every day no matter what position so im pumped
148031 did i learn a lot from pudge hes a future hall of famer so watching him makes everybody better im not pudge ill just go out and do what i can
148032 this is a surprise to people if they dont know the situations of the players
148033 both teams get better by this and thats what a trade is supposed to be all about
148034 whether he is with the kings or starting yet another rehabilitation program with another team ron artest will be one the most valuable fantasy players while he is on the floor we like him if he joins a new team where he has to prove himself more than if he remains with sacramento which will struggle to make the playoffs
148035 at this point im just hoping to get through the summer with no one else getting hurt
148036 batting third and playing first base got a great glove mark te te texss uhhhh mark is batting third
148037 practice your clich s in front of the hotel mirror
148038 kill time by computing the mathematical probabilities that youll get dealt to a contender
148039 you can be the linchpin to your old teams success by leaving it
148040 nobody has called me from boston and neither has my agent scott boras
148041 the only thing i know of a possible trade is what ive seen in espn
148042 during my years here ive seen how they the red sox have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy
148043 i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
148044 i think around here theres a lot more smoke than fire if something happens it happens
148045 the marlins always seem to be in the middle of everything
148046 it takes two to tango were looking everywhere were making calls were getting calls but were not going to be stupid
148047 ive always told you everything is possible there are all sorts of crazy things theres no way to say which trades are going to happen
148048 if something happens it will not be tonight and frankly i dont think that will ever happen lets wait if something happens before 4 p m thursday
148049 this situation is not a strange one for me because its more of the same story in my eight years in boston
148050 i should go to green bay straight up and they should send brett favre to boston that will end two soap operas at the same time
148051 as good a chance to win the division as the mets and phillies
148052 i cant say teams are exactly lining up to deal with the marlins at the moment
148053 you put that aside when you step between the white lines
148054 you go out there and try to beat the mets and let other people take care of that stuff ive still got a marlins jersey on it didnt affect me whatsoever
148055 its strange because that was the last thing on my mind a trade rumor
148056 im happy here until something happens ill continue to be happy
148057 if i can just get a victory out of kvd the garrison gate of my dignity will hold for another week
148058 who am i kidding the other three walls have already collapsed
148059 this is the only thing in the world that would make me interrupt my margarita and my carne asada burrito
148060 it is the interview of the most impactful trade ever in the history of fantasy fishing
148061 i dont want this to sound similar to the green bay packers situation and i hope you put it in this order because i know how the media likes to skew my organizations thoughts and ideas editors note not true
148062 team mr woodcock would like to thank kevin vandam for all the years for all the championships the organization loves him everybody at the facility loves him the town the town loves kevin vandam
148063 the problem is that there was a salary cap issue and we were trying to win a championship this year i am not looking forward to next year i am trying to win this year and because of the salary cap issue we had to let our most beloved player go we cannot think him enough for his years of service and we wish him the best with team fantasy pants
148064 its not how much they do its trying its trying to just im in this for business man ok this is a business its no offense to him like i said we love what he did for us the town loves him does he want to play does he not want to play make up your freaking mind dude
148065 i could fit him on my team but not my scheme editors note he was thrilled with that line because it rhymed he no longer gels with the rest of my team i dont think he i better stop talking there
148066 heres what im saying i better stop talking because somebodys going to get offended
148067 this is magic my team comes out to 49 9 this is why i had to go with aaron
148068 im here to win a championship this year not next year
148069 this one reminds me of a parallel in the news these past few days in short looks to me that zona would risk losing a friend to win a fantasy fishing war i mean the dude just dropped one of his best buds in the grease
148070 actually i heard about this trade from zona himself just this morning and dont think for a minute i let the italian donkey off easy he tried the whole points thing with me too but i aint buying any of that crap
148071 zona pretty much flat out admitted to me that he did this deal because he thought martens was the better pick on erie hes just covering his butt with kvd but i got no problem busting him out
148072 furthermore from a rules and ethics point standpoint this whole so called trade seems kind of borderline to me as a whole
148073 it reeks of a lack of institutional control on many fronts or maybe its just simply panic
148074 made a few moves myself im bringing the wood with an erie thunderstick one jamie fralick zona woofed when i mentioned his name
148075 when he makes the top 12 im sending zona a framed 16 x 20 of fralick with the word face written across the bottom of the photo
148076 oh yeah i got skeet and last years winner on my team too edwin evers so zona can kiss it and bring it on
148077 i like ole aaron martens as much as any of the anglers on the elite series in my book hes one the all time greats and i love to watch him fish
148078 but given the point we have reached in this debacle of a league you can write it in granite stone that im pulling out some voodoo karma
148079 ole j o is hoping byron velvick ties his boat off to aarons trolling motor and they are forced to drop shot the same rock pile for three days on lake erie
148080 a song doesnt leak by itself and pirates dont have some sort of superhuman ability to get their hands on pre release material
148081 no most leaked movies tv shows and albums come from the inside so blaming pirates is useless
148082 hi youre going to call off your rigorous investigation youre going to publicly state that there is no underground group or these guys are going to take your balls theyre going to send one to the new york times one to the la times press release style look the people you are after are the people you depend on we cook your meals we haul your trash we connect your calls we drive your ambulances we guard you while you sleep do not fuck with us

148087 this announcement further demonstrates ibms commitment to our state and to our people
148088 i look forward to maintaining this partnership with ibm for years to come
148089 this new data center is part of ibms commitment to construct the worlds most advanced data centers
148090 this is the latest example of ibms deep history of innovation in north carolina when we open for business in late 2009 the new ibm data center assures that research triangle park will be a strategic location for our outsourcing business for many years to come id like to thank the state of north carolina durham county the durham chamber of commerce and duke energy for their outstanding support that helped make this project possible
148091 ibms innovations have been a cornerstone of the research triangle park and durham county and this new state of the art data center certainly continues that outstanding legacy
148092 the majority are being caught in the shrimp trawls particularly in the gulf of mexico
148093 a lot of those sharks that are being landed are undersized
148094 thats putting a lot of pressure on those young sharks
148095 we consider cloud computing to be the model that can change the current it market structure fundamentally and create paradigm shifts
148096 to spread cloud computing in japan it is very meaningful that ibm has launched the first cloud computing center in japan at this time ns solutions research center will actively use this center and advocate cloud computing
148097 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
148098 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
148099 to develop high skilled human resources in it field it is necessary to create latest it environment in education place
148100 kyushu university is very interested in cloud computing technology which can provide an on demand it environment to our students and teachers we have been working with ibm the pioneer of this field kyushu university will continue to take advantage of cloud computing technology more actively
148101 this has always been one of the tougher teams to play against in my career now to be on the other side of that and cause havoc for everybody else is definitely a positive for me
148102 they expect me to be quick and run their team thats what ive been able to do throughout my career
148103 at this point in my career the last couple of years ive been wanting to get with a winning organization
148104 i know that this is deron williams team there is no question about that
148105 he has worked to get himself in that position and he is a great player in this league
148106 i had to scratch and claw my way into this league
148107 people from all over the world come to play in the nba this is a chance to really impact this situation
148108 he might not be like bruce bowens but he can go in and play tough d like he did for his past teams
148109 the only person who really shot 3s was mike bibby this team last year hardly took any 3s with maurice that should change a little
148110 with the eastern conference getting stronger i know i can make an impact here
148111 they didnt back down and took boston to the wire
148112 it looked like they ran out of gas in the last game
148113 if you want someone to defend i can do that if they need outside shooting i can do that whenever they need me im just going to get to work
148114 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the u s did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
148115 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
148116 what the u s wants is a revamp especially among the isis units which deal with areas along the afghan border additionally the u s wants to see new structures in place for closer oversight on people in the field basically within the isi there has to be a strong internal affairs unit of a kind
148117 is failing the militants are gaining ground the u s and others are just pointing fingers towards others
148118 vor allem auf der tauernautobahn in richtung s den werden sich die autofahrer wohl auf einen bis zu 20 kilometer langen stau einstellen m ssen
148119 i raised this question even before euro 2008 my only wish is to play in a stronger club if zenit agrees with chelsea or arsenal i will gladly join either of them the failure of the transfer to barcelona has upset me but i am trying to be philosophical
148120 i am perfectly aware of zenits position the offer 12m was really too small it is strange that my good playing at euro 2008 should have hurt my chances my price jumped and my dream will perhaps remain a dream
148121 i dont care who i work with at zenit as long as he is not a russian coach who wouldnt have a chance here anyway
148122 all this where have you been why didnt you tell me in advance this army monotony routine lights out reveille zenit wouldnt stand all that rubbish we are a different kind of team more democratic and modern
148123 this means the world to me because spurs were the first club i used to watch as a kid
148124 gazza was my favourite player when i was growing up the first shirt i ever got was a tottenham one with his name on the back
148125 some of my mates are tottenham fans and season ticket holders and theyve all got tottenham tattoos they always used to say youve got to come to tottenham and i would say i want to but they dont want me as soon as i knew they tottenham were interested in me there was nowhere else i wanted to go i grew up through the arsenal youth team but its not a problem for me all my heart is at tottenham
148126 we talked about that quickly he keane is not too old to forget that
148127 i had words with him we also had an argument in a league game at liverpool when we lost 2 1
148128 everybody knows roy keane as a temperamental man and they know me like that as well i am similar to roy keane because he used to be a bad loser as well i hate losing just like he did he was always so hot on the pitch i am like that as well people used to boo roy keane wherever he went and now they do that to me but people never boo a bad player
148129 but i am totally comfortable with that i like to wind the opposition up if i know people are ready to boo me i want to score against them i know the sunderland supporters will support me
148130 i chose sunderland ahead of both portsmouth and paris st germain because i came here and saw the training facilities and the stadium
148131 its beautiful i know what this club is capable of its a long time since sunderland have played european football but why should it not be possible if bolton can do it why shouldnt sunderland
148132 we cant hide the fact that we need new players
148133 everybody knows it we have to get five or six players in before the season starts
148134 we take very few positives only leon osmans performance really
148135 we are a long way away from where we think we are going to be but that is due to several different circumstances we are having to use some of the lads more than wed like to but some of them are just not playing well some of them are going to have to start looking at their own performances because we dont have any competition just now
148136 borriello has a problem which will be resolved quickly so we will wait for him shevchenko will play at chelsea this season
148137 besides kaka paloschi remains our only striker available so he will play the next two games that are important tests against strong teams
148138 hes only 20 and a full international he has shown glimpses of the real potential that enabled bristol city to sell him to wigan for 2m
148139 tottenham came in with a bid for stephen and the player is very keen to go which is fully understandable i would like to have kept him but it is a move which appeals to him and we wish him well
148140 trezeguet is not a player who interests us hes a great player but our squad is now complete were only waiting to see how the situation with etoo will develop
148141 is roy hodgsons judgement better than that of lawrie sanchez
148142 most football clubs are a work in progress especially after the type of season we had last year and even the year before weve got to try to re establish ourselves as a mid table premiership side at least to get there theres a lot of work to do
148143 we havent ruled out bringing in a couple more players but it wont be wholesale because weve done quite a few things already and im very pleased with what weve done
148144 its a great opportunity to play first team football in the premier league and i grabbed it with both hands
148145 the last few seasons have been off and on and last year was pretty much a write off for me
148146 its a new start for bobby he needs to put last season totally behind him and well work with him on the player he was before last season i think were getting a player that is more than motivated and anxious to show hes a top class premiership player
148147 if they dont want to treat it seriously then well keep winning
148148 if people like that dont want to take it seriously then thats up to them but obviously he shouldnt play or shouldnt want to play but i tell you what there are a lot of other players out there who want his place
148149 i had to explain to him what i was trying to say
148150 he understood and i told him that making this team is very important to me i do care about it and i do want to win and i want to bring the cup back to the states
148151 i dunno from when i talked to him and as far as i know it hasnt
148152 they are definitely suspended and will miss the beijing olympics
148153 the athletes have been charged with a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
148154 we were notified by the iaaf that their drug samples taken in out of competition tests in may 2007 and then at last years world championships in osaka do not match
148155 unfortunately we dont have much choice but to suspend them
148156 as i have absolutely no reason to consider myself guilty naturally i will contest this id like to apologise to the fans that we have ended up in this position albeit through no guilt of our own
148157 but the key thing was winning the fia confidence vote because if you are an elected official and your electorate dont want you to continue then you have to stop
148158 winning the case was good because it stopped all the nonsense about nazism that has now gone and that is the thing that really mattered
148159 it needs the independent teams to be able to operate profitably and if they cant operate profitably they wont operate at all eventually because they have to run at a profit
148160 one of the suggestions being made is the first thing you do is move the development area essentially into the drivetrain so that youre looking at the new technologies in the drivetrain things like kers things like turbo generators heat recovery all those sort of things which are relevant to the road
148161 not really because ive thought ive had that opportunity since day one ive had a couple of bad races but there has always been a long way to go so ive never believed i cant win
148162 the camp is an opportunity for the coaching staff to work with the players and set some foundations ahead of what is going to be an important november for us
148163 we have a new blend of experience in the coaching staff and we felt that this camp would be key to getting the ideas of both the staff and players across ahead of the new season
148164 it is an exciting time and both the coaching staff and myself are looking forward to getting down to business and working with what is a talented squad of players
148165 people ask me how do yall play that song so much
148166 unser kind hat zwar einen schaden ist aber kein schaden
148167 la hosting company dreamhost which hosts more than 700 000 web sites is encouraging its customers to use googles gmail for their e mail rather than the dreamhost mail servers

148169 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
148170 pressurized recovery has been around for the past 30 years but this is the deepest fish capture under pressure the previous record was 1 400m this is also the first time pressurized capture has occurred at a hydrothermal vent
148171 at depths of over 1 000m it is difficult to recover animals alive catching with no pressure is as good as catching dead fish are the most fragile even a fisherman with a 100m line will probably reel in a catch whose gas bladder is in its mouth
148172 the hope of some scientists is that they might be able to harness stem cells and program them to generate pluripotent stem cell lines capable of differentiating into many different types of cells which have the genes of patients
148173 in too many cases the departments trucks must drive through entire neighborhoods to collect only a few bins
148174 those neighborhoods that do not improve their set out rates will be dropped from the program at the end of this calendar year

148180 i confirm our ambition to be a major actor of the nuclear rebirth in britain we have been working on that for three years and we have taken measures to reach this target
148181 it has been in advanced discussions with british energy there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy a further announcement will be made when appropriate
148182 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
148183 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit
148184 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
148185 we essentially traded strong growth now for weak growth later
148186 as a result this may turn out to be a longer recession than were used to
148187 without the stimulus package this would have been a very standard u shaped recession
148188 what the stimulus did was put a bump into the middle of it turning a u into a w
148189 high oil prices are hitting europe and japan almost as much as they are here
148190 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
148191 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
148192 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
148193 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
148194 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
148195 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
148196 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
148197 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
148198 its becoming a more acceptable piece of technology for older adults
148199 used to be there just for safety reasons but its become a tool theyre comfortable with
148200 ive told them not to send me any because i have to pay every time i get one

148205 we continue to invest at record levels to bring new supplies to the market
148206 our congress needs to give us access to areas currently off limits to the industry
148207 the best way to bring downward pressure on prices is by bringing on new supply while doing everything we can to use energy efficiently
148208 whats shocking is that big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production or investing in alternative energy
148209 why do they need more land to drill on when all their money is going into buying up stock
148210 the situation has become critical and threatens the safety and security of the nation and its residents
148211 we are deeply disturbed by this imminent loss of communications service to vital public safety agencies
148212 in just a few days the navajo nation will lose its entire communications network including its public safety network as a byproduct of usacs mishandling of this matter
148213 sadly mothers are also no longer able to reach out and communicate with their children at war in iraq

148216 he was a very early supporter of senator obama and began that support long before the senate investigation into tax havens
148217 hes very interested in politics and he gives to both sides
148218 peter lowy never took any action to hide his ownership in anything
148219 peter lowy did not do anything improper or illegal or unethical
148220 the iron ring of secrecy around tax haven banks and their deceptive banking practices enable and encourage tax cheats to hide assets from the united states
148221 okay we have some social problems in this political system maybe well just deal with the social question

148256 the only i question i still have is whether or not tony blames sam for what happened
148257 we have indicated to the department on an ongoing basis that given the workload we considered it should be remunerated

148263 i sometimes think the writers try and figure out what would be the typical tv plot line and then head in the exact opposite direction
148264 if you ever think about turning that triangle into a square
148265 i kissed a girl isnt problematic because it promotes homosexuality but because its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention both from perrys boyfriend and her audience
148266 compared to the crap that buffy season 1 was this actually looks ok
148267 our big goal was to make the show four things funny sad strange and beautiful to have those be the informing ideas and nothing else anybody who felt like a misfit growing up appreciated the show because more than anything the show is trying to say that weird is good

148289 so you can see that these terrorist groups are not that capable of instigating massive sabotage activities as some hostile forces hope to see
148290 to the beijing olympic games the biggest threat comes from the east turkistan terrorist organization
148291 these forces are trying all means to sabotage the beijing olympic games
148292 these terrorist groups are not as capable as some media organizations have claimed or broadcast
148293 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed
148294 the conduct actions and unwarranted utterances by mr kimunya amount to gross misconduct and the chair speaker strongly takes great exception to them i therefore without any reservation severely reprimand the member for kipipiri for gross misconduct
148295 by alleging that if the substantive speaker was in chair the motion would not have been allowed mr kimunya cast aspersions on the integrity capacity and independence of the chair it was far fetched speculative and unacceptable
148296 kimunya cast aspersions on this house at a goat eating ceremony where he said that were the speaker in the country the motion would not have passed
148297 mr speaker sir we are turning to you to clarify whether or not you gave assurances that the motion passed by the house in the former minister was out of order
148298 what i said about carrying debate outside applies only to debates on substantive motions which result in a definite solution the subject matter of such debates indeed must not be discussed by hon member publicly outside the house while debate is pending whatever the nature of the proceedings things said by hon members in this house may only be answered by other members in this house
148299 to show maximum restraint and refrain from any threat or use of force against each other and to avoid provocative military activities
148300 reached a level so as to undermine the basis of the missions mandate and compelled it to temporarily relocate from eritrea
148301 by accident or design following the withdrawal of unmee remains a reality
148302 the work of unmee is coming to an end not because its mandate has been implemented but because it has become impossible for the mission to implement it
148303 the responsibility for the current impasse falls on the parties and on the parties alone
148304 reaffirming all its previous resolutions and statements of its president pertaining to the situation between ethiopia and eritrea
148305 stressing once again its unwavering commitment to the peace process and to the full and expeditious implementation of the agreement on cessation of hostilities of 18 june 2000 s 2000 601 and the peace agreement of 12 december 2000 s 2000 1183 hereinafter referred to as
148306 considering that ethiopia and eritrea bear a shared responsibility in the implementation of the algiers agreements in which they agreed that the delimitation and demarcation determinations of the eritrea ethiopia boundary commission eebc shall be final and binding and that their forces shall respect the integrity of the temporary security zone tsz
148307 regretting that eritreas obstructions towards the united nations mission in ethiopia and eritrea unmee reached a level so as to undermine the basis of the missions mandate and compelled unmee to temporarily relocate from eritrea stressing that this relocation was without prejudice to the algiers agreements and to the integrity of the tsz and recalling the security councils previous condemnation of eritreas lack of cooperation
148308 having considered the special report of the secretary general of 7 april 2008 s 2008 226 the letters from ethiopia and eritrea dated respectively 17 and 18 june 2008 in response to the letters of the president of the security council of 10 june 2008 and the letter from the secretary general of 28 july 2008 s 2008 496 in response to the letter of the president of the security council of 3 july 2008
148309 2 demands ethiopia and eritrea to comply fully with their obligations under the algiers agreements to show maximum restraint and refrain from any threat or use of force against each other and to avoid provocative military activities
148310 4 requests the secretary general to further explore with ethiopia and eritrea the possibility of a united nations presence in ethiopia and eritrea in the context of the maintenance of international peace and security

148313 pembangunan transportasi publik di dki jakarta tidak terintegrasi dengan pembangunan kota dan tata ruang bisa dilihat dari jalur bus transjakarta yang sekarang ada itu tumpang tindih dengan angkutan lain dan menyebabkan kemacetan
148314 pemprov dki jakarta dapat membentuk visi yang sama dengan perusahaan mrt jakarta mengenai realisasi transportasi terintegrasi diperlukan juga pembentukan komite tod yang akan menangani khusus implementasinya
148315 artinya pembangunan moda transportasi itu sejalan dengan pengembangan wilayah sekitarnya
148316 misalnya bus transjakarta saat ini masih belum disediakan feeder untuk transit penumpang dan pelayanan juga belum maksimal sehingga masyarakat yang seharusnya beralih ke busway masih enggan ini pekerjaan rumah bersama
148317 kalau kita lihat sekarang ini misalnya keterangan yang disampaikan hamka yamdhu itu bisa menjadi salah satu momentum penting bagi lpsk untuk menjalankan fungsinya dengan baik terhadap orang orang yang mengungkapkan kejahatan juga bobrok bobrok korupsi di indonesia
148318 celakanya kasus kasus itu melibatkan rezim saat ini barangkali ketakutan mereka seperti itu tapi saya juga melihatnya lebih ke isu politik kenapa pemerintah mengulur ulur kita sangat menduga pemerintah tidak serius sejak awal saja sebelum lembaga ini dibentuk dalam proses pembuatan uu perlindungan saksi korban juga kan merupakan inisiatif dpr dan bagi pemerintah ada atau tidak ada uu dan terlebih lagi lembaga ini tidak penting
148319 para orangtua harus selektif dalam memilihkan bahan bacaan yang berguna untuk anaknya

148322 all our companies in the world will have one brand name
148323 it is very important that the name reflects our values and our strength this is what we hope to achieve with zain
148324 this is a very important acquisition for celtel as the operator with the largest footprint in africa we bring a broad understanding of the trends and challenges of mobile telephony the perfect complement to kencells successful experience in kenya
148325 contrary to most of the other markets the second operator celtel not only failed to narrow its lag behind safaricom in terms of market share but lost subscribers in the second half of 2007
148326 not very long ago members of government were calling me and tuhoe that we were in cuckoo land to believe tuhoe is able to get into a discussion about this issue about tuhoe as a nation within a nation thats not going to happen hes dreaming yesterday that is not a dream its a reality
148327 justice delayed is justice denied if there is no space and there is unlikely to be any space in the foreseeable future what are the chances of moving the cash up option from 2014 to now so jim anderton hes been interested in that
148328 were getting a little complacent were far from out of the woods unless we can get really deep speaking deep thinking people language is a bit shallow at the moment and while many maori can converse conversationally nevertheless you have to be able to talk about the combustion engine halleys comet all those things in maori in order to feel safe
148329 poor old matukutureias been beaten up over the years quarried big time and the part that is going to be set aside is the remnants it still brings a swlling in the heart when you think about it when you go there
148330 there has never been a proven association of dinosaur prints with human footprints
148331 i said it looks like something has been washed out of this hole
148332 i seen the human track coming out and saw that it was a man
148333 i thought to myself lord ive been shown man was here when the dinosaur was here
148334 when i found it i said this has to get to someone who knows it
148335 i took it to dr baugh he liked to have a heart attack over it he shed some tears
148336 the compression lines the density features do show and there is no way to fake that
148337 it is possible to carve a track in limestone but there is no way to compress the material in the rock under the track that is absolutely impossible thats why the cat scans are so important
148338 during locomotion thats very important that distribution is shown here compression is in the right place under both prints density compression distribution the density factor is there weight distribution forward locomotion rocking of the foot
148339 within minutes or no more than hours of each other
148340 i know its going to change history thats pretty heavy
148341 disprove darwins theory god made man man did not evolve from ape
148342 i have really worked hard to figure out how it could be faked
148343 when i saw this i said this is too good to be true
148344 if someone found a way to fake that they could also get a patent for concrete that would far surpass anything
148345 i dont think it is going to displace the theory of evolution
148346 my hope is that the scientific concepts of archeology and paleontology will be used under the guidelines of the texas schoolbook committee any evidence supporting that should be presented and hopefully this particular fossil will be presented for the students to be able to see that there is evidence supporting an alternative concept as opposed to just evolution
148347 thought hmmm thats pretty cool i want to share it with a friend
148348 prefer card check because it means they know exactly how people are going to vote
148349 plans to spend some 150 million in this years election most of it to get barack obama and other democrats elected
148350 it is the fuel the opening for seiu to change our growth curve from 100 000 to a million or more workers a year
148351 that in itself burger argues makes the employee free choice act larger than any one single issue even more important than healthcare
148352 card check would make it easy for union organizers to intimidate workers into voting for the union by eliminating the secret ballot and then the seiu and other unions could force more cash from workers into the pockets of democrats now the seiu suddenly has 150 million from which theyve already committed at least 85 million specific to democratic candidates that money got squeezed out of the locals under duress in obvious violation of the spirit and letter of federal law the union knows how to protect itself and its interests and the lockstep nature of their support for democrats should awaken voters to the threat their policies comprise this is nothing more than a closed feedback loop for democrats and card check is the prize that will ensure its rapid growth
148353 i personally would want our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
148354 the most important thing for the u s government to is not just offer words but deeds
148355 i personally would want our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged

148361 looked for other types of people to bring to the show maybe more real life sci fi shows can get insular sometimes its good to see characters interact with real people every so often instead of just people who know the secret or robots
148362 both the show and movie take certain inspiration from terminator mythology like the value of self sacrifice perseverence and faith but when we deposited sarah connor in the present day we instantly created a new timeline and mythology for her
148363 people always say something to me at the pharmacy the produce section or the airport i always feel like im disappointing in real life just reaching for the celery
148364 surprised and thrilled at how many people are watching our show people are seeing the show and are really excited about it
148365 he was able but didnt have blood in him to be a leader

148377 i can think of at least two ways in which cameron could survive that blast the first is that the explosion didnt affect her chip and she could repair herself and grow her skin back although it was mentioned that terminators could be destroyed with intense heat second another terminator model just like her is sent back
148378 its science fiction on fox its on the bubble as of right now but its an expensive series that gets mediocre ratings by foxs standards im just waiting for the final word
148379 ign tv laughs okay gotcha the show is doing well in the ratings but everyone wonders is it doing well enough and speculating that because its such an expensive show it might be a harder sell for renewal should the fans be optimistic based on what youre hearing
148380 wait a minute theres two women in the leads in this show and theyre strong women one of thems a mother and the other is sort of a mother thats cool we want to see that

148388 it will be ready any day now but well have to wait until the high pressure arrives
148389 the barley straw is still a bit green but im hoping for a good crop
148390 i would think the claire will be ready mid august a bit later than normal and the spring barley looks at least a month away

148414 at 12 10am on wednesday we received a third party allegation that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street w1
148415 officers established the incident occurred at approximately 10 20pm on tuesday evening
148416 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
148417 he was not arrested and did not attend a police station inquiries continue
148418 this is one of the publishing sensations of the decade brad and angelina are the dream couple of the glossy magazine world
148419 if the companies keep going on like this we could have almost half of all households in scotland being fuel poor this will already take us uncomfortably past one third of all households being fuel poor and if it keeps rising it will only get worse
148420 we thought the rise might be high something like 17 per cent but british gas blew that out of the water
148421 either they stop these price rises now or they should expect tough action against them
148422 the chancellor of the exchequer should make it clear that unless we see these companies show some decency then he should be prepared to introduce a windfall tax and then use that money to reduce peoples energy bills
148423 we have found in the past six months that the restaurant trade is under some pressure
148424 people are getting energy mortgage and fuel bill increases and something has got to give
148425 luxuries tend to be the first to feel the pinch and restaurants may be seen to be a luxury
148426 we are still getting the same number of covers that we were but average spending has dropped and that has meant lower revenues
148427 but i think edinburgh can overcome this its done a tremendous job in recent years ensuring that it is not just august and christmas that keeps businesses busy but its year round
148428 for small restaurants the share of the market is getting smaller but it pressurises all of us to be keen in terms of pricing and service and that can only be a good thing
148429 i really do think food is one of the last luxuries people will give up
148430 people always want a night out to get away from the tv ten years ago in these market conditions restaurants would have really suffered
148431 but people are now ingrained in the mindset of going out for a meal its become a natural thing they will not want to lose that
148432 this council cannot turn its back on the huge social need which all of these under threat services provide the buck stops with them and they need to make every effort to make sure people are not stranded
148433 lothian buses is blaming the drop in passengers on the tram disruption a scheme which this administration brought to the city so it is up to the council to sort out the mess it causes
148434 the situation is deeply regrettable and i hope this is very much a last resort for lothian buses it is unfortunate that its least profitable routes are those with the arguably the highest social need
148435 we are acutely aware of how vital some of the affected services are for communities and are working hard to identify potential options for retaining the most socially important services
148436 i note that this alert has been billed as unprecedented but visitscotland ultimately have an interest in promoting edinburgh to the world
148437 looking to the longer term we have to recognise that times are difficult at the moment but it wont last forever and we do need additional hotel space
148438 the scottish government has set a target of 50 per cent tourism growth by 2015 and the area thats going to have to try to deliver that growth is edinburgh
148439 the city is the most important destination for business and leisure tourism and we need to have quality hotel and leisure facilities to accommodate them
148440 we are in the middle of a credit crunch and a global slowdown yes we are facing challenges in the short term but we have to look to the future
148441 its pretty unheard of for so much accommodation to be available and theres no denying things have been slow
148442 ive certainly never heard of visitscotland doing anything like this in august before
148443 i know bookings are well down although the industry is pretty confident it will recover through last minute bookings
148444 were trying to spread the message that there is still plenty of opportunity for people to enjoy the citys fabulous festivals
148445 edinburgh waverley is one of the busiest stations in scotland and a key transport link for tourists and commuters in the capital
148446 it is vital that the station has the necessary facilities to meet the needs of all our customers and these proposals will not only improve the steps for the thousands who can already use them but make this entrance suitable for a wide range of users who are currently unable to access the station from princes street
148447 the redevelopment of the waverley steps will be funded as part of an overall 150m package of investment from transport scotland which has already delivered the recently completed platform track and signalling upgrades at the station
148448 network rail is also planning to invest significantly in the coming years on refurbishing the station roof and buildings
148449 all of these investments demonstrate everyones commitment to giving scotlands capital the best station possible and enhancing passengers journeys
148450 by blending visionary learning and research spaces with state of the art technology napiers sighthill campus is set to become a campus fit for 21st century learning and working maximising opportunities for interaction between students staff visitors and the local community
148451 the redevelopment of the sighthill campus is central to napiers ambitious 100m estate strategy launched in november 2006
148452 the proposed building creates an arrival point in the form of a large civic space leading to the main entrance on the eastern side of the building
148453 the benefits to the local community far outweigh the inconvenience to the police were trying to encourage local people to take part in sport
148454 the race was due to take place at 8am on sunday morning when the traffic is very light and disruption would be minimal we were happy to pay for all of the police support offered and the police said no they werent prepared to listen to any of our objections
148455 we have been in discussions with the organisers and at no point have we refused permission for this event however we do have significant concerns as regards the safety of the public and competitors particularly in terms of the volume of traffic on the proposed cycle route
148456 triathlons like this take place across scotland and as such it is extremely disappointing that the portobello event has had to be cancelled
148457 i hope that some arrangement can be made to ensure the event returns next year
148458 this approach suggests a new breed of council housing in edinburgh the council should be applauded for taking a proactive stance
148459 this is welcome news it is precisely what the council should be doing and its taken a long time to get here
148460 this is the first time in a generation that the council has considered building homes which marks a major shift in strategy and defining council housing in the 21st century
148461 i hope the people of edinburgh will be reassured that their council is responding to the obvious difficulties many of them face
148462 when i went into the office after filming all my colleagues had put up a big silver star on my door and they were saying this is my 15 minutes of fame
148463 it was good fun going around all the locations some of them had been chosen in advance like the castle but i suggested portobello beach as i thought people abroad might not realise the capital city had a lovely beach on its doorstep
148464 it was very nerve wracking though i always sit at home and think how easy it must be to work in tv but after this i have a lot more respect for them
148465 the folk at work were all really supportive when they saw the film and theyve been playing it on the screens at work
148466 it was good fun and if i got a bit more notice next time i might do it again

148471 the regional divisions digital media activities continued to deliver good growth with revenues increasing by 33pc and operating profits by 31 8pc
148472 the numerous actions we took during the period to reduce our costs and improve our efficiency product portfolio and balance sheet have served to partially offset the impact of the serious downturn in advertising expenditure being experienced by consumer facing media businesses
148473 we have implemented a further efficiency programme which will deliver at least an additional 20m of savings in 2009 by accelerating technological improvements to processes across editorial advertising and pre press
148474 we believe that these initiatives alongside good portfolio management and our continued investment to build our digital revenues will see the group through this economic downturn and best position the business for growth when market conditions improve
148475 in cardiff our new multi media newsroom is fully operational and has delivered process efficiencies and cost reductions in the midlands the implementation of new systems for advertising pre press and editorial is on schedule and on budget and provides the platform for further efficiencies within the publishing process

148478 deborah provided valuable support to the councils communications team for nearly three years as she combined media relations work with her artistic endeavours
148479 all officers and councillors who worked with her admired her true professionalism candid advice and lively personality deborah will be sadly missed
148480 although deborah was a news editor at heart and just loved it when a top story came the newspapers way she went on to master the many other aspects of the editors role
148481 everything deborah did she did to a high standard setting a tremendous example for all who worked with her
148482 weston is a wonderful resort with lots to offer the loss of the pier was a huge blow to everyone but there is still plenty in the town and its surrounds to amuse and entertain everyone

148487 i was sat in the crown court press room surrounded by all these welsh media veterans when i asked them what they thought of our chances of getting the order lifted they said theyd never seen a section 39 challenged before it was hardly a boost for my already fragile confidence
148488 the atmosphere in the newsroom as we awaited the verdict while the clock ticked remorselessly towards our final deadline was like nothing ive experienced on a weekly paper before
148489 it reminded me of those nights in fleet street when we would watch england take part in a penalty shoot out they would invariably lose
148490 had steve come on the line five minutes later that four page wraparound would have been pulled thats how close it was
148491 a young woman is dead and in our view the accused is old enough for his name to be known to the wider public
148492 we are all really really shocked its a big blow for our readers who like getting their paper with todays news not yesterdays its a real shame
148493 following a detailed review of publishing operations it is proposed to restructure editorial distribution and certain field based newspaper sales functions
148494 it is anticipated that the proposed changes will deliver newspaper sales benefits and enable efficiencies in printing and distribution
148495 specifically it is proposed that both daily titles will be printed overnight in peterborough with editorial shift patterns and newsroom structures in both northampton and kettering being adjusted to accommodate adjusted file deadlines
148496 in distrubution it is proposed to adjust shift patterns to facilitate overnight distribution of both titles into retail
148497 prior to any implementation we will consult extensively on an individual and collective basis and we have commenced this process today with those individuals affected
148498 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
148499 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
148500 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
148501 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
148502 billin is a community physically divided by a concrete monstrosity which for more than 700 kilometres snakes its way around and through town and villages in which the stateless palestinians live
148503 our party arrived in billin as villagers poured out of friday prayers in the mosque to make their way to the wall two kilometres away the israelis had their answer waiting to counter this civil disobedience tear gas
148504 even the merest sniff of tear gas is enough to make you choke and even vomit the villagers turned and ran but they could not escape the effects and even though they legged it more canisters were fired over the wall
148505 one exploded just yards from where i was standing the full force of its contents erupted among the crops and orchards lining the route back to the village immediately i started choking my eyes watered tears and i couldnt stop retching
148506 for someone like me who has had respiratory problems this was a tough welcome to the on going crisis in the middle east fortunately the effects wore off after ten minutes but nevertheless it was an experience i dont want to repeat

148514 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
148515 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
148516 the possibilities for this new technology are huge for the first time users will be able to make low cost calls from any part of the world using a handset or other mobile device and will be able to seamlessly roam from one wireless hotspot area to another
148517 the amount of time being spent on mundane implementation work is very high
148518 with global online travel generating sales of more than us 100 billion and almost no african tourism sold online it is crucial that africa begins to harness the web especially with the world cup looming the e tourism africa conferences will help educate the sector to move online and take advantage of all the new opportunities especially in the world of web 2 0
148519 after ten years of hosting online tourism conferences globally we can see how international speakers and best practice experts inspire and motivate the tourism sector worldwide we now want to share this with african markets and give the continent access to some of the worlds experts on online tourism our partnership with e tourism africa is enabling us to do this we know that this will make a marked difference to tourism businesses across africa as well as their partners and suppliers abroad africa is an emerging and growing market on the tourism landscape
148520 africa really is the last frontier for the online world and i am very excited to help motivate and inspire people in the tourism sector there on what they can do to grow and expand their business online
148521 uk companies should look to africa as a fantastic new market tourism numbers to africa are rising and broadband speeds are increasing across the continent so we see many opportunities for new business an increasing number of tourism players in the african market will move to online marketing in a much bigger way
148522 acid reflux occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach pass up into the esophagus and the sphincter muscle the barrier between the two has a defect so it cannot block the acid
148523 the lining of the esophagus is not made to resist acid its very different from the stomach so acid reflux can cause ulcers and inflammation and a whole host of other problems
148524 there are certain lifestyle things we tell people to avoid
148525 alcohol consumption increases the risk of acid reflux as well as caffeine so do foods like chocolates and tomatoes or tomato based products if you have mild symptoms and can avoid these things you might be able to avoid medicines
148526 the thing that should be taken away is that acid reflux isnt going to kill you
148527 why we actually look down your throat into your esophagus with a scope is because it can cause other problematic conditions

148534 the teams will work closely with lu and dlr staff to tackle staff assaults and anti social behaviour and i encourage people to approach officers and raise any concerns they have about safety or criminality on the tube
148535 the teams will be working with members of their local community to identify local problems as well as working to develop targeted solutions to tackling crime and the type of behaviour that may not be criminal but which makes people feel unsafe
148536 todays announcement of 30 dedicated policing teams will make the tube a safer environment for passengers and staff it is vital that londoners can travel safely around the city reassured by a visible police presence these new policing teams for the tube will work alongside the additional 440 uniformed officers for the bus network which i announced in may to tackle the number one issue for londoners crime and safety
148537 london underground is a low crime environment but we know there is always more work to be done and these new neighbourhood policing teams will mean that officers can better get to know their local communities and the issues that are key in their area
148538 these officers will continue to work in partnership with the mps safer transport teams and transport operational command unit so that whatever mode of transport londoners choose a team of dedicated officers will be there to reassure them and tackle crime
148539 reduce the waste that you produce for instance just think about how much material you throw away when returning from a trip to a supermarket when you buy your fruit and vegetables choose loose rather than pre packaged photocopy on both sides of a piece of paper it could cut your paper consumption at work by half remember to buy recycled products where possible as this is far more environmentally friendly and helps create viable markets for more recycled products you also get as good a quality product as from one made from virgin material
148540 re use products or buy a product that can be reused re use your plastic shopping bags take one of your old ones the next time you go shopping or ask for a bag for life instead of throwing paper away why not re use it if it has only been written on or printed on one side as scrap paper it can come in useful for shopping lists reminders or be used as a note for someone
148541 the main problem in discussing this kind of issue is that it comes down to tens of millions of individual choices made by people and public policy is largely ignored or ineffective anyway
148542 then there is the power of social norms letting people know what other people do informing them that most of their peers are organ donors leads to more registered donors
148543 have already decided made england and scotland two nations labour have had a majority in both but as the prospect of governing england on the back of scotland loomed it became clear separation was accomplished no englishman can rule in scotland of course and now the reverse is as true

148546 a huge exodus of work that used to be done in offices and face to face and it is starting to move online
148547 the one thing weve been lacking sufficiently are reports relating to your investment
148548 we really have to get down to the grassroots here because we dont have any grassroots
148549 people are able to experience first hand some of the many services we provide to keep people safe as well as obtain information about ways to protect themselves against crime
148550 i have to rodeo to make a living i know it is affecting lot of people like guys who do this for hobby it doesnt make sense to go anywhere when you cant make enough in a weekend to pay for the fuel to get somewhere but i dont really have a choice i just have deal with it but i dang sure dont like it when i do have to fill up on my own
148551 we could rodeo three or four guys comfortably and never buy a room but now we are traveling in cars or mini vans and buying hotel rooms its still cheaper than doing a diesel pickup
148552 every one in our group has been fortunate and has been winning pretty regularly but if you dont win you have got to find something else to do if you dont have anyone to enter with i dont see how you can do it by yourself
148553 if you get a chance to win say 30 000 or 40 000 in one steer you have to make a catch you have to be confident and make it work
148554 if i didnt have a chance i would go home too
148555 everything costs more but it seems like there is more prize and sponsorship money floating around too
148556 i thought gas prices would really affect how many we would lose but those cowboys i talked to have said it is worth it coming to reno because it is such a huge rodeo and it pays so well

148564 it has been clearly demonstrated that director mirgon has no motivation to correct the shortcomings of the system
148565 his actions not only endanger our membership he exposes the county to tremendous financial liability should a first responders injury or death be linked to the inability to communicate director mirgon has squandered precious county resources to attend lavish training conferences with no documented benefit to the county his long term arrogance and derision towards our personnel is completely unacceptable
148566 the principal complaint is the failure of the 911 emergency management technology services division to address the gross inadequacy of the radio communications equipment used for transmissions of law enforcement principally the douglas county sheriffs office the system failures also effect the operations of washoe tribal police officers animal control officers after hours alpine county sheriffs office and periodic use by the nevada highway patrol the failures of the radio system promote an environment of extreme officer safety perils in an era of limited personnel and increasingly violent criminal activities the statistical probability of an officer injury or death increases daily the county faces a tremendous liability in the event of an officer injury or death contributed by the failure of communications equipment
148567 there is no place in county government for someone who ignores grand jury recommendations to the imminent peril of law enforcement and fire personnel any member of our association would have been terminated immediately if we conducted ourselves in this manner
148568 but the sheriffs office has no authority over the agency its under the direction of the county manager and because of the former county manager holler it didnt get done theres no doubt in our mind the sheriffs administration has put in a lot of effort
148569 we know the sheriffs administration and the new county manager desire to be part of the solution our ultimate goal we need to be safe

148590 mit der aufstockung des baf g erleichtern wir die entscheidung f r ein studium denn wir haben damit deutliche finanzielle und strukturelle verbesserungen geschaffen
148591 auszubildende mit kindern sowie migrantinnen und migranten stehen im fokus der gesetzes nderungen und profitieren seit jahresanfang in mehrfacher weise von den verbesserungen
148592 ein hauptanliegen des bologna prozesses ist die mobilit t der auszubildenden unser ziel ist 50 prozent der studierenden sollen einen teil ihres studiums im ausland verbringen bei 20 prozent davon soll dieser aufenthalt mindestens ein semester dauern dass die zahl der deutschen studierenden im ausland in den letzten 15 jahren kontinuierlich gestiegen ist ist nicht zuletzt dem auslands baf g zu verdanken

148595 i drive a bmw 1 6 se petrol 3 series saloon it was bought new in 1995 by my husband and has been my car since 1998 when he died it has done just under 55 000 miles has an mot and annual check at the garage it was bought from and has a full service history
148596 i do about 5 000 miles a year mostly local but some motorway miles on holidays so need a car with speed when necessary a smaller more eco friendly new car with the refinements of the bmw plus climate control and rear parking sensors with the comfortable seats of the bmw and its reliability would be ideal for the leafy lanes of surrey is there such a car
148597 after the committees decision last night we hoped we would have more time and they could have allowed us to stay
148598 we would have liked more notice as well about five or six people have got nowhere to go

148613 i am excited and extremely honored to have an actress of mary tyler moores stature and talent join our show
148614 that was one time and you know i had a sty

148628 i was sitting dazed at home watching the tv and when i saw fans burning an old no 17 shirt by the shankly gates it did my head in
148629 show some respect dont you know how this is tearing me apart
148630 fans ive spoken to want rio out and if he left it would be mourned by few and welcomed by many
148631 he is grossly overrated and i totally support the fans who gave him stick at charlton
148632 theres no going back its time for me to move on im desperate to play champions league football and thats why i have to leave villa villa kept saying they wanted me to stay but i have not heard from the manager for weeks it just made me think that he and the club were just saying one thing in public but were not really bothered at all about me in private its seven weeks now since the season finished but while the gaffers found time to be a pundit for the bbc at euro 2008 he hasnt found the time to speak to me but liverpool boss rafa benitez has shown how much he wants me at anfield i am obviously flattered that someone as successful as rafa benitez thinks so highly of me and that hes not been afraid to put his valuation of me in black and white for villa and all the world to see but have villa offered me anything to try to persuade me my future is at villa park not anfield not a thing
148633 it is on record that manchester united came to nigeria spent sometime here played a match that was seen by the whole world and ate our food without anything happening to them now that the players and officials are back home in their country they are definitely ambassadors of nigeria because they are in a position to explain to those outside the country how peaceful and warm nigerian people are
148634 i understand that position of the club because we are playing for so much from the start i have said that i want to play for my national team and at no time have there been any problems until now
148635 i am waiting to see what fifa says and if they say i do not have to go then i will not go and if they say i have to go then i will go without waiting for the outcome of the tas because that would be too late and my team mates and the national team coaching staff are waiting for me
148636 if once i am there tas says that i have to return then i will return but for the time being i want to be with my national team and my colleagues

148655 the growth of the plants shows that there are excess nutrients getting into the lake
148656 plant succession is the process by which stronger plants take advantage of the presence of another plant to invade a habitat
148657 generally the presence of vegetation in a water body reduces its depth due to the increased deposition of silt
148658 the hippo grasses that have invaded lake victoria are usually present in rivers and small pieces find themselves in the lake
148659 typha grass and papyrus could soon sprout in the lake leading to floating islands
148660 the grass is usually common in the shallow areas of the lake next to the shore
148661 consequently the area under the grasses and other vegetation will expand with time
148662 this strategy has been applied successfully in uganda and tanzania
148663 in the long run the grasses will lead to increased yields of fish species such as lung fish mud fish and tilapia ngege
148664 on overall view the grasses are more economical as compared to the water hyacinth
148665 lake victoria is not about to disappear at least not by the growth of the plants
148666 the gradual reduction of rivers nyando and sondu miriu could be a stronger cause for alarm over the disappearance of the lake
148667 mechanical removal would be a good option since the pieces of the plant could be carried away to feed livestock
148668 a long term solution for the problem would be reducing with the huge nutrient load in the lake
148669 we need to deal with nutrient flow in the lake right from the top regions of the catchment
148670 look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
148671 this will enrich western methods to improve local communities adaptation to climate change
148672 the study revealed that the community has a well developed indigenous climate forecast system that could be integrated into western climate forecasts
148673 the timing and duration of the rainfall was important to the largely peasant farming community
148674 there is need to conduct ecological genetic and physiological studies of these manifestations as well as the local physical geography and astronomic conditions
148675 the colonial government tried to get us to work with them but the local community resisted
148676 even advanced science would not be accurate to homestead level
148677 the kenya institute of property institute will ensure that the rights are not violated
148678 food aid will not solve the food crisis in africa if the issues to do with climate change are not addressed
148679 we need to scale up our forecasting methods since climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of disasters making forecasting difficult

148688 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
148689 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
148690 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way
148691 we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out

148726 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
148727 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
148728 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy

148731 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing
148732 the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
148733 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
148734 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts
148735 it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv

148739 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
148740 what the u s wants is a revamp especially among the isis units which deal with areas along the afghan border additionally the u s wants to see new structures in place for closer oversight on people in the field basically within the isi there has to be a strong internal affairs unit of a kind

148766 tell you what take this sack of peas home with you and next trip this way let me look at that red marble
148767 there are two other boys like him in our community all three are in very poor circumstances jim just loves to bargain with them for peas apples tomatoes or whatever
148768 when they come back with their red marbles and they always do he decides he doesnt like red after all and he sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an orange one perhaps

148775 magnetic measurements of brain activity could be free from noise in the future thanks to a new helmet like device developed by medical physicists at the los alamos national laboratory in the us magnetoencephalography meg is the only technique that can directly measure neuronal activity in the brain but it is plagued by background noise that interferes with signals from the brain itself the new helmet could provide much more accurate information on brain function p volegov et al 2004 phys med biol 49 2117 meg is a non invasive technique that provides detailed information on the brain in almost real time by using superconducting quantum interference device squid sensors to measure the magnetic fields generated by currents flowing in and around neurons however these magnetic field signals are extremely weak typically between about 10 14 and 10 13 tesla and are therefore easily overwhelmed by background magnetic noise although various techniques exist to reduce this noise none are entirely satisfactory because they can also reduce the size of the signals produced by the brain itself the helmet designed by the los alamos team is made from a layer of superconducting lead and is placed around the squid sensors see figure the helmet needs to kept at temperatures below 8 kelvin in a liquid helium cryostat for the lead to be superconducting the device works on the principle that meissner currents flow on the surface of the superconductors in the helmet these currents expel magnetic flux therefore preventing any external magnetic fields from penetrating the helmet moreover unlike previous methods the helmet can be placed close to the head without affecting signals produced by the brain the scientists have already tested their helmet on real patients and say that background noise signals can be reduced by more than six orders of magnitude making it the most effective system to date however the device still needs to be improved because noise levels are still relatively high around the brim
148776 vortex dynamics in superconducting systems imaged by scanning squid microscopy abstract using a scanning squid microscope ssm we have studied vortex distributions in various superconducting systems the excellent flux sensitivity of the ssm allows us to resolve individual vortices for low flux density field cooling produces quenched vortex patterns which can be disordered in strong pinning nb films or well ordered into a lattice in a moge films with weak pinning surface steps alter the field cooled patterns with vortices formed in dense rows along the low side of steps with few vortices near the high side we observe an asymmetry in the dynamics of vortices around the surface steps under the application of a driving force the vortex line tension impedes vortex motion from thin parts of the superconductor to thick regions while not affecting the opposite motion down the steps we have also investigated the behavior of vortices in thin superconducting strips in a perpendicular magnetic field a complex problem due to the large demagnetizing effects these geometrical barriers are frequently encountered in transport measurements on high tc superconductors strips with transverse surface steps as well as strips with a uniform cross section have been imaged we are attempting to correlate the observed vortex distributions with transport measurements of the vortex dynamics in the strips

148783 this all culminated in 1952 when i had my second coronary thrombosis
148784 after the second coronary i was told i would not live much longer that i might die any day and shouldnt make the effort to take so much as a step unless i necessarily had to
148785 having lived 42 or so years and having reached the end of the line without happiness without health therefore all this knowledge you have accumulated is of no avail

148787 i began correcting all my thoughts and feelings in that direction
148788 not that the world stopped pushing against me it continued but i was at a place where i could resolve things almost immediately having cleared out the negative fears all the negative i can nots i would focus right on the answer to every problem and get it very quickly
148789 my whole life turned around from being depressed and sick to being happy and in perfect health all the time
148790 one of the things that happened in this process was my identification with others i saw that we are all related we are all inter connected each mind is like a radio broadcasting and receiving station that we are all tuned into each other unconsciously that we are just not aware of it that life was meant to be beautiful meant to be happy all the time with no sorrow and to be with perfect health and so after reaching that high point of understanding in 1952 i have wanted to help others to discover what i had discovered
148791 i believe if i can do it anyone can do it
148792 never look for results while you are intending for if you do you will not find them
148793 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
148794 if anyone can do it then it will be bohm
148795 bohm was desperate to know to discover the secret of everything whether through physics or through mystical knowledge and yet he insisted that reality was unknowable because i believe he was repelled by the thought of finality
148796 insofar as the mystic chooses to talk about his experience he has to follow the rules governing the domain of the ordinary that is he has to be reasonable logical and clear
148797 his dreams were of the light that penetrates yet his life was accompanied by great personal pain and periods of crippling depression he never achieved wholeness in his own personal life and the fruits of that life which are still with us were gained only at great sacrifice
148798 truth is a pathless land dont listen to gurus including the present speaker
148799 ill present them in a way that the public will find pleasing
148800 well youre not a genius so why bother doing those things pick something small
148801 find a very very small area in physics and then just publish about ten or fifteen papers on it then youll get a reputation then you can go and do this other stuff
148802 thats the way that physics is going to progress by people doing little bits of things
148803 if this is the way things are going then theres no point in my doing physics anymore
148804 between where you are now and where youd like to be theres a sort of barrier or a chasm and sometimes its a good idea to imagine that youre already at the other side of that chasm so that you can start on the unknown side
148805 lets sit down with this fellow swedenborg because he seems to be a very intelligent deep thinker now what is he saying
148806 what if its a metaphor for something an image of something alright then what is it an image about
148807 okay if youre talking about energies and im talking about energies then were talking the same language which is about relationships of energies

148836 mr president has graciously approved a five member federal government delegation to the games
148837 mr president as a keen sportsman has decided to draw a curtain from previous jamborees and open a new chapter in doing things right in the sports sector our new focus is the athletes and their welfare
148838 previous participation in games of this magnitude has resulted in unnecessary and over bloated delegations in terms of both athletes officials and the federal government delegation
148839 team nigeria will proceed to beijing from korea on 4th august at which time the games village would have been opened to all participating countries nigeria will be represented in 10 sports and these are athletics taekwondo judo wrestling weightlifting table tennis boxing badminton football male and female and swimming
148840 a total number of athletes and officials is put at 125 out of these 82 are athletes and 43 are technical officials including coaches sparing partners in combat sports medical personnel and other auxiliary staff
148841 the remaining 60 journalists can be accredited but will have to find their way to beijing to do their jobs in this world of globalization i believe five journalists are more than enough to cover our participation in form of hard copy reporting
148842 these five journalists approved by the commission are to be nominated by the nigeria union of journalists nuj and the sports writers association of nigeria swan
148843 a series of events the shooting of a bound palestinian protester two military police probes and as of tuesday the suspension of a battalion commander show a worrying and dangerous downward spiral

148845 encourages the opponents of the fence to ratchet up the conflict and a pparently it also increases pressure on idf officers who are having difficulty keeping events in check
148846 my greatest concern is that the idf will lose its humanity because of the continued fighting
148847 china would promote regional economic co operation to advance towards mutual benefits and all win results

148859 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
148860 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
148861 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
148862 further to the announcement made on july 24th 2008 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
148863 there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy group
148864 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept
148865 edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
148866 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder in a publicly listed company it is a now matter for both boards to see how to proceed
148867 the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
148868 recent developments in energy markets underline the need for new nuclear to combat high fossil fuel prices climate change and security of supply
148869 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
148870 or did they bring the war to those innocent people

148880 we are seeing creditors pursuing debtors more aggressively through the courts at baker tilly weve experienced a 40 per cent increase in individual and corporate creditors instructing us to pursue debts as people and businesses demand their cash back

148890 migrants from africa will successfully settle in australia just as previous waves of immigrants from different backgrounds have done
148891 each month we see women walking into our centre saying khat is destroying their family
148892 if khat is banned then men in our community will go to alcohol or hard drugs or something worse than khat
148893 this has become a huge issue and a very divisive one within the community
148894 he chewed it all night then was too tired to go to work and he lost his job and would spend what little money we had on khat my family broke up because of khat
148895 this will be done with a view to developing recommendations for correcting the problems indentified
148896 the jcf strategic review report substantially supports this it states clearly that the pcoa should be focusing more on performance management and the thematic style of inspections
148897 these inspections because of the depth of examination could take two to three months to conclude
148898 as soon as possible when the air ambulance is available
148899 formal request of scotland yard for its assistance in cracking the number of unsolved murders still on the books
148900 we want the world to understand that we abhor this despicable crime
148901 we have found some of the stories reported in certain areas of the press insensitive untrue and have added to our distress
148902 while acknowledging the benefits of pointing to the dangers ahead one must distinguish between that and the harm which widespread negative speculation can cause in the public mind especially when suggestions for better alternatives are not forthcoming
148903 divergence of opinion can be a sign of a healthy democratic environment what we must guard against is that divergence becoming a cacophony and thereby leading to a diversion from achieving our common goals indeed it would do us all good never to forget the vision and courage of the founding fathers who gave birth to our integration process in the wake and wake it was indeed of our failed federal experience
148904 in addition to certain foreign commentators some prominent regional voices and members of the media corps seem to be losing heart and are on the verge of if not already predicting collapse of the integration process some of this is due to the economic partnership agreement with the european union eu to which we are about to subscribe some is also due to the fact that we have not adopted suitable governance structures and point to the european model of governance despite the differences in geography history and culture and notwithstanding the fact that the experience of some who have copied the european model has been somewhat unflattering
148905 if we are to withstand the veritable onslaught of negativism which turns a blind eye to 35 years of achievement gained by the toil
148906 i just talk to the senator she asked me if ive got your signature yet
148907 we hold the cuban government responsible for the welfare of juan carlos herrera acosta

148909 were going to nationalise bank of venezuela im calling on grupo santander to come and start negotiating
148910 they wanted to sell the bank to a venezuelan banker and as head of state im saying no sell it to the government to the state
148911 were going to recuperate bank of venezuela were very much in need of a bank of that magnitude

148913 the whole idea is to transform main street into a beautiful area one week before carifesta i am appealing to patriotic guyanese to work with me
148914 we were ready to take them out by force because they had refused to leave voluntarily but finally they understood we were serious and they decided to leave

148916 so if youre flying to cuba you can learn salsa and if youre flying to new york you can learn hip hop
148917 weve spent four years working on the 200 metres though
148918 we want to give him the best chance of glory at all times but you have to plan and ensure that youre not just going into it because theres a chance of glory
148919 instead you have to go in and ensure your chance is solid a silver and a gold is not bad but im a patient coach
148920 i like to dot the is and cross the ts with everything that is within my control
148921 for the 100m you have to be extremely experienced at this level in stockholm he got left at the start and just got up and ran and abandoned all his technique that was a result of inexperience
148922 we had a plan and we embarked on that at the beginning of the season that was to concentrate on the 200m and use the 100m to improve speed for it
148923 at the end of last season when i assessed his performance and assessed his competitors the only person who was able to beat him was someone with a faster 100m time
148924 so we wanted to get the 100m as fast as the people hes competing against in the 200m and maybe we can run them both at next years world championships that was the plan
148925 im arguing that it should change its a clean development mechanism and im arguing that this should be changed to a market based mechanism especially to trade carbon and carbon dioxide from forest that is sequestered through tropical rain forests
148926 europe now through an emissions trading scheme has been trading credits to the value of 33 billion we feel that we can generate a significant amount of money for developing countries like ours if we were to have a market based mechanism trading these credits
148927 haiti has to move forward otherwise the people begin to lose confidence that anything will change
148928 it wants to influence policy makers by giving them an incisive and authoritative analysis of a crisis situation
148929 we are going to pursue the fight to have a government in this country things are very difficult people are hungry they are starving and they dont have a government to help them get a job or put programs in place to help them

148931 the government cannot pay employees the cost of food is going up the price of gas is increasing
148932 the 74 million contract to pave the rutted highway in haitis central plateau region should have been signed last month american investors should be pouring in after congress gave the ailing textile industry a boost and a third of the haitian senate should have been elected by now
148933 its a governing challenge because it basically impacts our ability to have confidence in the implementation of our programs
148934 this means heavy losses as investors have their eyes set on africa and india which are a real threat
148935 honduras has not exported to europe for a long time precisely because of this protectionism
148936 the area of growth is europe because they latin america have saturated the us market for years
148937 the longer it takes to resolve the tariff row the worse it will be for latin american producers
148938 this disaster brought a significant new beginning to nevis and we must never forget its importance in the history of the island
148939 they all encouraged members to work together diligently among themselves and with other private and public sector partners they also assured members of their readiness to support the growth and success of the sba from assistance available within the government and the chambers resources
148940 my life has been one of service to the people of grenada and i am please once again to be called upon to serve this is an exciting challenge which i hope will bring a renewed professional approach to policing in general and to the rgpf in particular
148941 my job is to help bring to the fore the talents and abilities of the men and women in the force i look forward to enhancing the professionalism and respectability of the police while developing the machinery that will help in eradicating crime in the country
148942 only through a deliberate national strategy and an action agenda can we hope to fully harness the raw human resource potential with the aim of promoting attitudinal change and social renewal
148943 i think its just that my music is just a little different
148944 i really like being able to feel like im talking to someone one on one
148945 it was weird because i didnt expect anything next thing you know its a different thing every week something would happen then we found out i charted in europe
148946 it was a way i could express myself and people would hear
148947 not many people will listen to poetry unless theyre really into poetry
148948 i dont think you have to go through a situation to understand it you can still console people
148949 its a pleasure for me to be chosen to serve as the president of the st vincent amp the grenadines chamber of industry and commerce and this once again demonstrates that csme is working and would continue to be good for our region and island states
148950 as the head of a business operating within st vincent amp the grenadines i recognize the importance of the chamber in working with all businesses within the community and i remain committed along with the rest of the new leadership to serve all those businesses well through advocacy business development services and strategic alliances
148951 i and several other female employees have been subjected to unwelcome comments gestures touches of a sexual nature from my supervisor joseph murphy
148952 additionally i have been subjected to racial comments about african american employees which are offensive
148953 i have complained to management on numerous occasions with the most recent complaint on or about may 20 2008 but it failed to take effective action to stop the harassment
148954 john greenan has become a valuable member of the county executives team and has been outstanding in his role as commissioner of personnel
148955 his leadership has been instrumental in the county executives effort to run county government like a business certainly johns track record of success will be a key factor when the county executive reviews his appointment this fall
148956 within 24 hours of receiving a complaint from mrs fanti i turned the complaint over to eeo and the county attorneys office for investigation
148957 as a result of that investigation mr murphy was suspended for one week this was the first time i had received a specific complaint from mrs fanti regarding harassment
148958 it has been going on for years he makes sexual comments about peoples breasts and says things of a sexual nature to most of the women in the department
148959 they are inaugurating a black guy on st patricks day
148960 to get an array of public information on one web site is fabulous

148962 the two ugliest words in niagara falls and perhaps the country were love canal
148963 but the agency has been very successful in turning that neighborhood around and now its time to put it to rest
148964 what i find very frightening is that the folks who live there now have been abandoned
148965 something potentially deadly will leak out of the ground not tomorrow but sometime in the next 20 years and therell be no one there to help the people
148966 we have completed the mission we set out to do
148967 when we covered it we used the best technology available at the time
148968 we told them construction was the wrong thing to do
148969 this mixture of a devils broth bubbled up through the breached clay and into the backyards of houses
148970 fear of the unknown gave rise to concern and hysteria
148971 we needed this for inspiration tell our major sports teams to get a hint
148972 six years ago all we had was a vision when we were awarded a franchise
148973 we didnt have a pair of shoulder pads we didnt have an office we didnt have a football team id be lying if i said five years ago i envisioned thousands of people on market street and helicopters flying overhead
148974 because of the novelty of going over there they were fine with it
148975 the one thing were really excited about doing is that fans will have the opportunity to actually sit in the seats they sat in that they held when they had season tickets at the spectrum we worked really hard on it but weve been able to put it together so it should be a lot of fun
148976 this will be a wonderful opportunity for thousands of our fans who used to attend our games at the spectrum or watch them on tv to come back one last time and see the flyers in our old home
148977 there was an energy white paper ten years ago but absolutely nothing has been done
148978 we need to maximise the use of renewable energy and build a sizewell c
148979 we also need to help people individually with what they can do to insulate and reduce their energy needs
148980 i have been campaigning for a long time about the fact energy prices were going to go up and there is nothing you can do about it because there are a lot more people in the world demanding energy and energy resources are much more limited
148981 therefore the price is going to go up and we have to live with higher fuel prices
148982 i think ipswich borough council has shown significantly advanced leadership on this front and other councils in suffolk ought to take very seriously what ipswich is doing
148983 engineers have restored power to some customers but are working as quickly as is safely possible to supply power to the customers who remain affected

148996 everyone here starts off at a certain place and they get better
148997 two million people are serviced by one 45 year old pipeline
148998 its come down to this theres going to be a new pipeline built whos going to build it
148999 absolutely i have a whole western part of the county that needs water
149000 my interest is introducing water to the parts of the county that dont have it
149001 in seven years it went from 9 million to 18 million for genesee county to buy water we represent about 10 of their customer base and pay about 20 of the cost of the system
149002 the increases put us close to the point where we were paying as much to purchase water that it would take to build our own system
149003 its not something i started but it is something id like to see finished
149004 my wife and i have been traveling extensively and i think its time to started scheduling things around when and where we want to go and not around board meetings and around the activities of the college
149005 i have truly enjoyed being an sc4 board member over the years sc4 has been blessed with a vibrant student body an excellent faculty staff and leadership in drs richard norris ernie dear christa adams and rose bellanca
149006 im sorry hes leaving because norms been the most stable person
149007 hes always been the grounding force im going to miss him hes always had good advice
149008 someone who has the same qualities someone whos wise who has sound judgment who is dependable

149011 this show is fixed they fixed it when they got rid of melinda she had the best voice of any ai contestant in any year she might not have sold them records and they couldnt have any of that
149012 oh yeah that melinda doolittle sure can sing shell be in the finals for sure dont cha know
149013 yeah no offense but we do have much better hook ups
149014 some are taking this opportunity to assuage their own egos by claiming that they werent surprised at all
149015 the need for more of an equal balance between positive and negative influences in entertainment
149016 theres no time like the present to speak out on issues and use the most popular form of musical entertainment to motivate and inform
149017 thats why i decided to call the album acid reflex its an aggressive response to what i see going on there are a lot of people out there who feel like mainstream music doesnt truly reflect their concerns or how they feel our art form is being kept artificially young and artificially dumb listeners of all ages are noticing that theres more to what we do than whats given us on the radio and on t v
149018 well i wonder what jon is thinking he should be happy

149020 if you could succeed at any other talent what would it be and why
149021 is there a song you hope to sing on the tour this summer
149022 why do you feel it necessary to apologize after a negative critique
149023 the one thing i think might hurt him is his lack of power behind his voice and i think that it might have something to do with him being a stoner he sounds and looks like he smokes weed and i am not just saying that because of his dreds hes very mellow sounds just like a stoner has short breaths which would indicate a smokers lungs and his eyes were very glassy and red
149024 this kind of music could definitely suit your voice you could make an album out of it i dont know if that was a stellar performance for me there were some pitch problems and sometimes you rushed the music a little bit but it was alright
149025 whats great about you is that youre consistent your are who you are you have an emotional connection with each song that you pick and i think thats what record companies and executive want you are brooke white excellent and wonderful
149026 i totally disagree with paula because i think what was lacking on that song was any emotion it looked like you were busking your way through the song i thought all of you looked very odd together as a group it wasnt one of your better performances i wasnt that crazy about it
149027 you sang it well enough and i liked the ensemble touch of adding an intimate band around you but your performance came off as safe and boring for me brooke and im going to have to agree with simon in that i didnt really feel anything from you on that one you have the potential of being a real breakout talent on this show it just didnt happen tonight it wasnt bad it was good just not great
149028 you know what i love that youve been doing the past couple of weeks youre a rocker but youve been showing that youve got this unbelievable range i liked how you went into the falsetto there you made your own arrangement which was very cool and once again another hot consistent performance
149029 i like your haircut let me tell you something ive never heard a guy do that song and it was fantastic hearing you do that going into your false with strength it shows how well rounded you are as an artist
149030 im not going to say it was as good as last week because it wasnt but if you can make a song about sparrows good which actually you did congratulations
149031 this was as weve come to expect from you which is good you didnt slip at all in the quality of your performances as others have done you didnt reach new heights or blow me away but your voice is a real find and a real treasure this year
149032 i wasnt jumping up and down but i wasnt mad at you either it was alright you showed some signs of strength right there and conviction i thought it was a pretty good performance i would say six and a half out of ten
149033 im very proud of you because i was a little worried that you werent going to connect but i think that you really had a great minute and thirty seconds and you really connected with the audience and you were having fun
149034 look were not going to remember this in ten years time are we it was cute you sang it quite well but overall i thought it was forgettable and i thought it was very reminiscent of something you would see and hear on a cruise ship if you want my honest opinion
149035 youre starting to come out of that little shell are you really that shy youve got this big old voice trapped in that tiny little body and tiny little personality i know theres more to you than what we see on that stage you just need to find that confidence and comfort in yourself
149036 i thought it started a little bit rough for me but by the middle of the song i thought you picked it up i thought yeah this is kind of cool you worked it out
149037 this was one of your strongest performances you seemed so comfortable you let go your voice sounded so strong and rich and you were confident it was great i loved it
149038 this is the point where i lose my season pass to dollywood because i didnt like that at all it sounded like the same song as before referring to ramieles song simon probably doesnt know any of dollys songs i didnt think you sang it particularly well i dont think this kind of music suits you well if this had been the first time id seen you or heard you i wouldnt get it sorry
149039 well i thought it was better than that i agree with paula that this was one of your stronger performances its not always about how familiar the song is youre singing but what you bring to it and youve gained tremendous confidence on that stage was it your best no but youre growing and getting better
149040 i do believe that that will probably be one of the better performances of the night nice job
149041 carly that was glorious you are such an amazing talent you are beautiful that voice of yours oh my god and you look great
149042 i thought it was good i dont think it was great i also think that youve got to have a word with whoevers dressing you at the moment i think at this stage without being rude youve got to start looking more like a star and im not seeing that progression at the moment
149043 the irony of simon giving wardrobe critique just sells itself what can you add to that i thought you had a beautifully controlled performance i think youve kind of fallen into the middle of the pack in past weeks but that performance right there should remind the people at home why youre here and how good you can be
149044 david archuleta is back tonight and i stand corrected that was the best performance of the night right there
149045 you have an amazing tone in your voice youre strong you have a beautiful aura about you youre just glorious
149046 i had issues with your choice of song last week this week absolutely on the money
149047 that was a great performance for you david you hit a rocky patch a bit there but you seem to have righted yourself this week this song and style definitely suited you
149048 country music is definitely your wheelhouse and i think you gave a very nice performance this is kind of the kristy lee week
149049 you look stunning tonight you just gave a beautiful performance i think this was your best performance
149050 i totally disagree i thought last week was your best performance and i thought this was pleasant but forgettable
149051 i knew that this would be a good week for you because this is the kind of music you can sing and if this were country idol id be praising you as a contestant but its not and i know as soon as you cant sing something country youre going to go back to being the girl whos just way out of her league on that stage or maybe youll grow as a performer in the meantime and surprise us all but im sure well see you next week
149052 you took on the biggest tiger of the night and i think you did pretty good its still hard for me to hear anyone else sing that song it was alright
149053 you look beautiful that colors gorgeous on you lets talk about your voice your voice has like a velvety tone thats it for you and i just think youre growing and growing and growing and youre connecting with the audience so much more and i love it
149054 you forget what a brilliant song writer dolly parton is because this is one of the best pop songs ever written i almost wish you hadnt got it in a strange way the first part was good the second part as i had a feeling unfortunately paled by comparison to the whitney version i dont even know if it helped you that much it was a good it wasnt a fantastic version of the song
149055 you keep on bring it up every week a notch dude that was a blazing hot performance nice job
149056 i just want to say one thing youre a star a rock star a blues star and you look gorgeous
149057 i think this is the best i have heard you sing throughout the competition
149058 far and away not only your best performance to date but the best performance of the night as well great job
149059 if youre going to steal my man im going to steal your song

149063 whats happening in our state is the older core cities become warehouses for lower income people the unfortunate
149064 the auto industry is in turmoil we didnt realize how much we depended on them to subsidize our services
149065 anything beyond 30 and you start to see a decrease in stability and value in a neighborhood
149066 tenants typically dont put money into the units they dont put money into yards there are absentee landlords
149067 once an older house in our community deteriorates to a certain point its going to be demolished
149068 its very important to maintain our existing housing stock because thats one of our best assets
149069 im getting a lot of calls from people who are getting foreclosed on they can afford the market rent but they couldnt pay the jump in mortgage payment
149070 homeowners are losing their homes and people cant afford to buy them but guess who buys them the landlords
149071 when the market turns in a few years ill sell them
149072 so we end up with a concentration not only of rental units but subsidized rental properties typically thats a burden to us theyre receiving the services but not paying the tax
149073 we cant afford to provide subsidized housing for all of southeast michigan
149074 as anyone living in port huron can tell you in the last 10 to 15 years more and more people are moving out to the suburbs
149075 what we need to do as a community and as a whole is to give people a reason to move back to come back to downtown
149076 one thing you need to be careful of when youre talking about the percentage of renters is cause and effect
149077 this is just one indicator of the economic health of our community
149078 all the indicators are going in the wrong direction in the country theyre worse in michigan and even worse in port huron

149096 hatton is an aggressive puncher who swarms his opponents from start to finish while malignaggi is one of the purest boxers in the game today
149097 as a fan i am excited to see if hatton can lure malignaggi into a brawl or if malignaggi can dictate the tempo and make the fight his no matter what happens i think when their styles collide its going to make for great action and great drama

149103 each of which has now received subsequent regional productions our community is small and i felt the plays deserved a wider audience i was pleased that victory gardens agreed i researched these plays over the past several years attending many in israel the plays deal with secular religious relations religious fundamentalism growing up in israel the spanish inquisition and with life under the threat of terrorism romance comedy drama i believe too this is the first time we see plays performed together that are empathetic to both israelis and palestinians hopefully this creates a balanced perspective to encourage dialogue

149127 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
149128 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
149129 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
149130 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
149131 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
149132 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
149133 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
149134 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
149135 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton

149137 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
149138 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
149139 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
149140 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
149141 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
149142 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
149143 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
149144 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
149145 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates

149207 measures aimed at improving residual values and reducing bad debts will be pursued more intensely

149224 this is a really exciting initiative which we are fully supporting
149225 this project offers an incentive for young people to wear cycle helmets and to begin thinking and learning about road safety from a young age
149226 head injury is simply devastating and children and young people risk the effects daily by not wearing a helmet because they fear pressure from peers and the need to conform to a designer image that is not portrayed as cool
149227 august 15 and 16 the caravan of hydrogen cars will stop at the university of north carolina in charlotte where the vehicles will be refueled using mobile stations the public can look under the hood of the vehicles and several guests will be invited to drive to the next stop in greer south carolina
149228 it is common practice to search a person when they are arrested
149229 while searching her bangerters purse officers found what they suspected to be weed marijuana methamphetamine pills and a 22 caliber gun that was loaded
149230 i am a little nervous we need to look at this as a long term project
149231 we can do this in an orderly fashion in a timely fashion i just hope we are not getting ahead of our dreams or at least our initial dreams
149232 it wont have to be everybodys main street u s a
149233 on the way home the guy got a little squirrelly with the handles and wrecked
149234 weve had some minor incidents people jumping off of rocks and getting injured but not any falls like this

149236 we would like to see it done as quickly as possible
149237 were working really hard to get some other projects built to alleviate traffic congestion and give alternate routes
149238 weve put together a very very strong staff and were looking forward to having a great year for the kids
149239 we want this year to be awesome and have everyone participate
149240 i think its really cool that we the senior class will be the original thunder
149241 were the biggest school in the district i know that
149242 i think it feels better to get the award a second time
149243 it says a lot about our reputation and where we stand
149244 it says a great deal about our student satisfaction on a broad spectrum
149245 its one of the more important rankings that we have gotten
149246 they only talk to students who give bad comments along with the good
149247 its quite remarkable because it is based on what the students say
149248 this is definitely a place where the students are happy
149249 this is a bill that encourages federal investment into research on how we use water
149250 we have a relatively good amount of confidence that increased research will yield good results and perhaps great results
149251 different costs associated with each step on both sides of the equation
149252 its going to make more money available for the kinds of programs our nation has to have
149253 we have to change societys view of whats beautiful and desirable
149254 is going to be our greatest challenge for the next decade
149255 this bill is beautifully timed and is going to be very very important to southern utah
149256 breastfeeding is the one choice that all mothers can make that will have life long benefits for both mother and child
149257 given the opportunity newborns who breastfeed will have had the very best start for infant nutrition
149258 intermountain healthcare and dixie regional medical center join with the worlds leading health experts in recommending and supporting breastfeeding
149259 we recorded the album at grouse lodge studios in ireland and the same studios in berlin hansa where u2 recorded achtung baby
149260 very much melody based but its different too in ways from the other albums
149261 its hard to know what everyone will make of it but were happy id go as far as to say i think its our best album yet
149262 jamie and katie are finally taking the plunge and buying a place together but they are arguing over where exactly to base themselves and now the monkeys are getting involved
149263 theyre telling jamie to get a pad in london where singer alex turner lives its becoming an increasing source of tension and jamie is the one bearing the brunt of it
149264 hes got alex and the lads in one ear telling him to move down south and katie in the other pleading with him to ignore them
149265 friends are joking that shes turning into a modern day yoko ono and turning jamie away from the group
149266 he ran fifth in the tj smith but he didnt have the best of runs and made his run too early and only battled away that day
149267 he hasnt been over the trip since but its only because the opportunity hasnt been there for him until now
149268 hes never really backed up before but im hoping he can do it the only time hes gone close to backing up was nine days after the sires produce into the tj smith
149269 ive always thought he could get a mile 1600 metres and i think hell run well but my worry is hes jumping from 54 5 kilos to 58 kilos this time
149270 i was struggling to get boxes on course at rosehill for my pair and i thought i might have to stable them off course
149271 but ive made a few phone calls and its been sorted out but ive only got two boxes at rosehill and wont have room for any more
149272 black minx won her trial by more than two lengths in the fastest time of the day over 650 metres and she was very impressive
149273 the filly sat three wide all the way and clocked a tick over 40 seconds on a dead track
149274 presley also won his trial by eight or nine lengths over 900 metres and i was very impressed with him as well
149275 hes been given a little freshen up and has done so well and im expecting him to run a big race
149276 he got back a little bit further than i would have liked in the ramornie because of his wide gate 14 but the run was full of merit and i cant take anything from the winner he won very well
149277 tim knows the horse very well now and im confident that hell make the right decisions on the day
149278 hes always got to be ridden patiently and from that alley three well probably see him slot in midfield somewhere and saved up for a crack at them later
149279 it looks an even race and theres a little bit of the unknown with a good filly like danehill smile resuming but my blokes going well and hopefully we can kick off the season perfectly
149280 i have respect for other peoples horses but i think he is better than he was
149281 we havent given him a lot of hard work and it has paid off because he has held his weight well and hes eating well
149282 we will get over tomorrow and if he happened to win and pulled up well then he probably deserves to run in it the liston
149283 he is a horse that races best early in his preparation and with his pedigree and his build he has the potential to be a stallion
149284 we threw him in the deep end last time but he responded very well
149285 ric has been coming down from brisbane to ride fast work for me every tuesday and thursday for the last couple of months
149286 hes grown up a lot in that time and hes got a very level head on him now
149287 provided hes injury free im sure he can be right in the finish for the jockeys title this season
149288 i didnt get the chance to run my horses in brisbane during ei when the meetings at eagle farm and doomben were restricted to horses trained on those tracks
149289 i cant separate them and theyll both run good races
149290 grecolo is close to a win his last run was very good but he got held up and should have finished closer
149291 hes a stakeswinner as a three year old and this is a nice race for him at this time of the year
149292 escreve num jornal onde h uma cruzada declarada contra jos s crates
149293 sim com que eu na maioria dos casos estou de acordo
149294 the right race has been there at the right time of his preparation and if he can keep winning we will have a go at the emirates
149295 we will see what happens at caulfield but i told the owners when he won a maiden at colac in february that he might make a listed or group three horse and now for the last two months we have been aiming at the emirates
149296 it is going to be a stronger field than last year with sydney horses coming this time but if you look at the videos of his last three wins he command prince has been hit with the whip just three times

149298 i got an offer from cranbourne to do a match race with apache cat for 200 000 over 1200 metres in october but its too close for us
149299 takeover target is still in england but he leaves today and will go to eastern creek in sydney for two weeks
149300 ill have his leg re scanned when he comes back and well see where we go from there
149301 its only a slight tear in his suspensory but hes also got a bruised heel and between the two of them perhaps thats why he stopped so quick in the golden jubilee
149302 if hes okay id like to aim for the age classic and then we might do singapore and england again next year but well have to see if he stands up first
149303 it was discussed last week when the cranbourne club launched its plans for sunday racing
149304 the time suggested was cranbourne cup day on october 12 and it was suggested either takeover target or miss andretti run in the match race against apache cat
149305 its only in the early stages at this point in time but if apache cat runs in melbourne in the spring it may fit in and be a possibility
149306 at this stage we hope to be in melbourne but the amount of runs he has will be limited if we go to hong kong
149307 hong kong is looking more suitable now and at this stage well focus on one melbourne run in the age classic and then hell have to go into quarantine if we go to hong kong

149317 our concern is that the government wants to lock up the kimberley without proper recourse
149318 if this listing goes forward the detrimental economic ramifications for western australia in the agriculture and resources sector will be massive
149319 the current impact of green and red tape that agriculture faces already makes it tough for farmers and pastoralists to stay viable without more constraints that heritage listing would bring
149320 dont these wise men from the east understand how difficult it is for cattle producers right now
149321 input costs are currently outstripping current returns on cattle and any additional costs which would invariably flow on from such a listing would kill off the cattle industry in the kimberley altogether
149322 the agricultural sector is already facing flow on costs from the new carbon emissions trading scheme
149323 the australian heritage council is doing a two year national heritage list assessment of the kimberley
149324 the council and the commonwealth government must consult with owners occupiers and indigenous people with a right or interest in the region as part of this process
149325 obviously we are unclear on how it will impact on further development in the region i think in one regard its really positive but in another there is some concern over what this means for people investment and business in the kimberley
149326 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
149327 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
149328 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
149329 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
149330 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
149331 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk

149453 i dont think youll be able to touch it but youll be able to feel the vibe
149454 we are prepared as anybody could be i think and the chances of peoples day to day life being disrupted by the convention i think are minimal
149455 there are very few people that are even talking about anarchy the media just seems to give them a very broad platform which is something i have not been able to figure out how to address
149456 my opponent is solely responsible for 4 a gallon gas
149457 there is a broad based slowdown in manufacturing activity across the euro zone with a disastrous number in spain
149458 there is a risk that the euro zone could fall into recession
149459 now if the 4870x2 was actually notably faster than the 280 for about the same price then i might even take a chance on it

149464 i suppose it will be between mid october and november 15
149465 to be frank i wish to say that at the moment in xinjiang there are only a limited number of sabotage activities by east turkestan forces or groups
149466 these terrorists groups are not at all as capable as some media organizations have said
149467 a very small number of sabotage activities and many of them have been stopped in the early days
149468 with our experience in dealing with terrorists especially the east turkestan islamic movement over the past years we are confident that we can thwart any terrorist activities in time
149469 other anti china forces at home and abroad so long as they engage in sabotage activities or any kind of destabilization
149470 the government has been very worried about the security situation there
149471 she victoria is hot funny and lets not forget her success with the spice girls
149472 the inflation figures came in close to what was predicted but they are very high how will this influence the mpcs decision on hiking interest rates we need to wait for the rates released by the central statistical office
149473 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
149474 the teamsters union that represents ups has been trying to organize workers at fedex for many many years
149475 he skirts labor laws conveniently creating a situation where truck drivers are independent contractors and not employees and dont have the protections that ups drivers have
149476 has a disgraceful record of stripping workers of their most basic rights to organize and fight for a living wage it is disheartening although not surprising that john mccain would consider picking such a notorious enemy of hard working men and women to be his running mate
149477 respectful campaign is on the attack comparing obama to paris hilton and britney spears and making false claims about his energy plan
149478 this is george bush shaking hands with john mccain promising not to run a negative campaign the narrator of one mccain campaign ad in south carolina in 2000 stated
149479 do we really want another politician in the white house america cant trust
149480 reject this character assassination reject the low road to the presidency
149481 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me obama tells a campaign audience
149482 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
149483 he is claiming that what were doing somehow has racial overtones says mccain campaign manager rick davis
149484 to be honest i dont know how else you explain the quote about the dollar bills other than to believe that somehow barack obama was calling something we had done racist
149485 given the seriousness of these issues obama writes in his fundraising email
149486 theres a gulf between what hes the winger paid and what we can afford well react to what he comes back with
149487 mariah has been busy in the studio while nick has been filming for his tv series
149488 burglaries are usually an opportunist type of a crime burglars are driving around looking to see what they can steal they may see something that catches their eye in the garage and come back for it later on
149489 anything that takes effort theyll move onto something else the majority are going to be cars that are left unlocked the other is a large area where they are going to have cars and that would be your apartment complexes

149502 se aquilo portugu s porque est escrito em ingl s

149504 hey jerry that really bothers me when you do that would you mind not doing that
149505 i dont want to fucking talk about it i am not talking game right now
149506 we have made it clear that we think coal should be part of the mix in the future we are absolutely determined as soon as we can to develop clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage ccs
149507 we know that china is building coal fired power stations and the real prize is to develop technology so that the ccs technology can be fitted on to coal power plants in places like china
149508 while i fervently believe that climate change is the biggest pre eminent challenge for our planet in the 21st century we also have to worry about energy supply and energy security and we have to go in for diversity and therefore coal needs to be part of the mix
149509 although for some protesters the great challenge is britain with no coal at all just washing our hands of it the challenge for us in the uk government is to be one of those lead nations developing clean coal technologies that will benefit the globe the planet as a whole
149510 we dont feel we should be burning coal at this stage in the climate crisis for the government to be considering building a whole new fleet of coal fired power stations is real madness
149511 we need the government to put in incentives and frameworks that will allow companies like e on to opt for renewable options
149512 why are we going for the most polluting option when low carbon tried and tested technologies like wind power like solar power already exist and could be rolled out
149513 kent has a massive role to play in delivering renewable energy if you look at the london array the offshore wind farm and youve also got the kentish flats
149514 theres huge potential in kent for both investment in renewable energy but also in the economy and kent really could be at the heart of our fight against climate change
149515 the uk is facing a major challenge at the moment weve got a third of our power stations closing in the next 10 to 20 years so we need to fill the gap so we can keep the lights on
149516 kingsnorth power station is going to be closing by the end of 2015 what we want to do is replace it with something that is much cleaner
149517 what we are talking about is technology that will allow us to produce electricity from coal that is far cleaner than we have ever seen before in the uk
149518 its a 20 improvement in efficiency that means 20 less carbon emissions which can only be a good thing
149519 we believe that carbon capture and storage is absolutely critical if we are going to tackle global climate change
149520 what we want to do is demonstrate this new technology at kingsnorth so that one day it can be exported around the world to all coal fired power stations
149521 although the industry is talking about fitting carbon capture and storage nobody knows how soon this can be done
149522 so what the committee is saying is that the government should not allow any new coal fired power stations to be built unless there is an absolute condition that they wont operate without ccs
149523 there are other ways of producing electricity we could do with more wind power particularly off shore in the south east we could do probably with more nuclear power as well
149524 coal is the dirtiest option and environmentally disastrous if we allow coal fired power stations to be built without carbon capture and storage
149525 if we do not move to low carbon electricity generation in this country we will face a terrible problem in 10 years time and pay an even bigger price when we have to solve it then
149526 im ever so sorry ms x our records show youre dead

149535 our thought leadership efforts have given us credibility and notoriety in our target market
149536 when i hand my card to a prospect with the tagline if you want more information about the construction industry visit www midwestconstructionlaw com it really piques their interest because they see that we are committed to the construction industry
149537 they dont want to be sold but welcome online resources that help them make informed decisions our site has generated three great speaking engagements at construction conferences and up to eighty participants regularly take part in our teleseminars
149538 because we provide so much useful information prospects spend time on our site educating themselves its only natural that some companies contact us and say i see you do succession planning can i talk to you about it
149539 another tactic to bolster connections is through reverse networking instead of contacting others to pitch yourself let them come to you and judge for themselves whether they want to contact you
149540 it requires work and a commitment to look at your company from the perspective of the outside world generating a company wide ongoing effort to thought leadership is the best way to ensure that it happens
149541 thought leadership starts by taking a good look at your target market and identifying the point on the horizon where your want to take your organization
149542 thought leaders determine opportunities to position themselves within their target market based on their key competitive advantages
149543 when thought leadership achieves widespread ownership inside a company there is greater likelihood that the company will generate the internal momentum critical to keep thought leadership moving into the marketplace
149544 identifying the point on the horizon where your want to take your organization
149545 overseas contract workers incur a lot of expenses including plane fare even before they leave the country this is our way of assisting them so that they wont have to rent a vehicle
149546 when consumers think smithfield they should think pigs because thats what the company is about smithfield pumps pork products onto the market at volumes that weigh heavily on people and the environment massive hog farms mean tons of waste and smithfield has been fined as much as 12 6 million for violating clean water act provisions by improperly dumping waste in waterways on the human side of operations meat packers endure poor working conditions and poorer treatment than employees in most other industries companies such as smithfield require workers to perform strenuous tasks in low temperatures causing bodily harm that often goes undiagnosed or untreated like most other corporations smithfield has a stated commitment to the environment and its employees but the companys actions hardly reflect these admirable principles

149558 i was relieved to come away with an exceptionally hard fought win orkney in my opinion were slightly on top in the first half in the second i thought we controlled most of the play until the last 10 minutes when orkney threw men forward and were unlucky not to get a late equaliser on three occasions thanks to their new coaching team they were well organised fought like tigers and had some very good footballers especially robbie balfour up front who caused us no end of problems and scored their goal
149559 following the withdrawal of the western isles team from the proposed three island championships between themselves orkney and shetland the decision was taken to run the competition as an open event
149560 peoples faith in the judiciary is shaken terribly it is most unsettling of all destabilization the judiciary is practically the only institution that people trust if that remaining trust is going to vanish who else can they trust
149561 this involves the second level highest level of judiciary their judgment is practically law practically gods word then were going to be in trouble the supreme court should act on this allegation more deeply and more quickly
149562 when you say that the second highest level of judiciary is corrupt and bribable whos going to be safe investing here or even traveling here
149563 not only the national but also the international reputation of the judiciary could be compromised if theres no decisive action on this matter
149564 it is at the doorstep of the supreme court because it is the level before the supreme court
149565 act swiftly to get to the bottom of this latest scandal and immediately punish the guilty
149566 the swiftness within which the supreme court responds will determine whether the damage is temporary and minimal or if it will be massive and irreparable
149567 what the city government is doing right now is giving beneficiaries ample time to settle their obligations to avoid cancellation of their housing contracts
149568 operators wanted to save their investments so some of them complied
149569 not only do these illegal structures obstruct the navigational lanes but they also add to the poor current flow of the lake which decreases the lakes natural ability to self cleanse
149570 we are confident they will be able to resolve the issue as soon as possible
149571 they can take care of themselves let the proper forum take care of it

149573 central and southern luzon visayas and mindanao will experience cloudy skies with scattered rainshowers and thunderstorms becoming widespread rains over aurora and quezon which may trigger flashfloods and landslides
149574 light to moderate winds blowing from the southwest to west will prevail over southern luzon visayas and mindanao and coming from the east to northeast over the rest of luzon the coastal waters throughout the archipelago will be slight to moderate except during thunderstorms

149580 i was looking at him on the news and just thinking what an amazing moment this is watching his speech in berlin and thinking what a critical moment this is for america and for attitudes towards what they can achieve amongst the black community
149581 if barack obama can do it it will be the most fantastic boost i think for black people everywhere around the world
149582 i think republican candidate john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world that they can win
149583 i am full of fire i am like a greased bounding panther
149584 the violence of the people there its their responsibility they have to know that if they are going to be there its not good for them and its not good for us
149585 in this situation even so called less lethal crowd control weapons such as rubber bullets and tear gas have strict limitations on their use rubber bullets can be lethal when fired from less than 40 metres away
149586 the mukhabarat intelligence services appear to have hit him repeatedly they transferred him to a hospital under a false name so his family would not be alerted but a friend recognised him we think they will take him back to prison he is very sick
149587 the shebab young boys were looking for a place to escape to because they were stuck between the fence and barbed wire
149588 meanwhile the jeep was getting closer and closer we started running away but the younger children couldnt run as fast they were still near the fence then the driver of the jeep got out and shot three live bullets we heard the bullets and then we saw a young boy on the ground
149589 i said dont go you are young he said no im going just give me the onions
149590 we continue to focus on the key drivers including innovative high quality consumer preferred new products effective integrated brand communication competitive levels of advertising and promotion and superb execution with our retail partners

149594 our child is equal to an israeli child i hope the israelis realize they are going nowhere by killing children
149595 this resistance is not armed but peaceful and it will win
149596 we call on people to use non violence but the israelis provoke people and they are not in our control that is the problem
149597 we depend on this land for our livelihoods and it is all our land if the wall was on the 1967 border between israel and palestinian territory we would not make any protest
149598 but the younger ones werent able to keep with us i looked back and saw the driver of the jeep get out and fire three bullets and a young boy was lying on the ground one young man went to fetch the body and shook it to see if there was life and part of his skull just went on the ground
149599 we have a right to be on our land they dont have the right to shoot him on our own land

149608 despite the likelihood that the rumors contributed to the fall in the share price the fsa has not uncovered evidence that they were spread as part of a concerted attempt by individuals to profit by manipulating the share price
149609 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumors were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hbos share price
149610 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day

149632 business conditions for the automobile industry have deteriorated sharply over the past weeks rising oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy have made business conditions significantly more difficult
149633 as a result of the ongoing global financial crisis the price level of pre owned cars has dropped and consequently the revenues that can be generated on vehicles returned at the end of leases have not recovered
149634 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packed and was not stamped in conformity with the excise act
149635 based on our estimates by the companies paying these fines they will not be making any profits out of the illicit activities they had in the past
149636 the result weve seen today brings to a close a significant chapter in contraband tobacco history
149637 the message sent today is that no company is above the law
149638 we realize we are going to take a hit to our reputation because of this
149639 we acknowledge we violated this section of the excise act
149640 imperial is paying 600 million and benson and hedges is paying 550 million when you add up the criminal and civil fines
149641 theres no winners in this because the industry has addicted a whole bunch of young people who then became lifetime annuities for these companies

149651 on groceries so far ive saved about 20 a week i was spending about 170 and now im spending about 150
149652 you know what youre doing you dont have that fear it takes away your anxiety of saying did i spend too much
149653 retailers have actually determined that they are able to get 12 to 18 percent more sales with people who use credit
149654 so i thought if i could use cash id be saving 12 to 18 percent on my routine weekly purchases
149655 you feel more in control of your finances you have a greater peace of your destiny

149658 the first tee was frankly more difficult than i thought it would be
149659 but i made a good swing and the nerves went away absolutely five feet off the tee box and i didnt have them all day again
149660 i was just happy to get it in the air
149661 someone drops the puck someone hits you in the face there are not any more nerves thats the game
149662 theres no place out here to just kind of shake them
149663 after i hit balls on the practice range i went for a jog i ran over to the clubhouse just to breathe a little harder and try to calm down a bit so i dont think theres a whole lot you can do on the golf course other than have the experience of going through it
149664 the difference with hockey is youre nervous youve got all that anxiety and youre ready to go but the first shift you get out there and you pop somebody or somebody pops you and then the games on the nerves are gone
149665 yeah i got the benefit of herbie and none of the pleasure wish i could have played for herbie longer
149666 my dreams were pretty big for hockey and i have to tell you most of them were fulfilled i didnt think that i would see and do the things i did by the time i was 25 or 26 years old
149667 i would guess its kind of your curtis cup walker cup ryder cup kind of environment golf is an individual game and occasionally you get to represent your country there is nothing more special that you will ever do in sport
149668 the millions i guess are nice and people like that but you want nerves and apprehension put that jersey on one time
149669 i watched just like everybody else and was thoroughly excited
149670 i never felt one ounce of regret or should have been there im just thankful that they had the right guys there at that time to win
149671 it was a long winter it was a measurable winter herbie was a very very very demanding and difficult coach to play for
149672 you dont know if you played harder to prove him wrong about something or if you just were mad at him all the time that was part of his philosophy he didnt want friends he wanted everybody ticked off all the time and fighting each other for jobs and fighting him and fighting everything else
149673 every single utility would decrease the time they said it would be before solar would be a significant part of their utility mix
149674 in a country where solar radiation is sub par compared to many parts of the u s i have to hand it to the progressiveness and commitment germany made to solar
149675 in the upcoming months we should expect to hear more from pg amp e activities in this area
149676 half the utilities on the trip really had done nothing or little solar installation
149677 its plug in and play literally you buy a solar panel and put it on your roof drop down two wires and call the electric utility

149688 ekim told me once those gyrologic guys ordered his pilates encyclopedia funny how guido never mentioned pilates never mentioned the idea of pilates the absence of acknowledgement makes the truth all the more naked gyrologic is an extension of pilates no more than fancy frosting on top of the pilates cake
149689 i never knew much about it only everyone that did it acted like pilates was passe and gyrologic completely overshadowed and replaced the method
149690 their whole focus on spiral movement is just an extension of the progressive pattern they go off into la la land not even acknowledging the shoulders they stand on they cant afford to do otherwise

149741 without a specific dust related standard oshas ability to levy specific citations or penalties is limited
149742 imperial sugar is a tragic example of what happens when employers fail to uphold their obligations to protect employees as required by the osh act
149743 some people like to pass the buck to be quite frank they want to try to shift the blame away from them and put it on someone else
149744 for industry to run safely you do need some guidance in the way of regulations
149745 a company that experiences a major dust explosion can expect to receive a fine from osha as imperial has but absent a standard thousands of other companies that may be at risk do not benefit from clear instructions about what kinds of dust are the most hazardous and what training and controls should be put in place
149746 we have not ruled out looking at doing a standard
149747 nfpa believes osha must develop regulations to address and mitigate dust hazards by incorporating by reference the relevant nfpa codes and standards
149748 lets not ignore the combustible dust problem by assuming osha has it covered already or attempt to reinvent the wheel by having osha write new regulations when the information already exists in nfpa documents

149773 if holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court i want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here
149774 what i said was that i know that the hague does not have a death penalty but if anybody deserves the death penalty its radovan karadzic because he was responsible directly or indirectly for 300 000 deaths
149775 so if he is still afraid of me while he is in a well padded cell in the hague i guess thats an indirect compliment in a way
149776 the united states abstained from the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president bashir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice

149778 there was just a lot of music going on in kaunda square we used to listen to a lot of reggae and i think thats how i got into reggae as well but of course my interest in music started while in secondary school where i used to take part in variety shows although at that time i didnt think i would end up as a professional musician
149779 this was another big thing for me being at evelyn hone that time
149780 there was a tree there i think it is still there we used to call it the wisdom tree this is another place where we used to meet and share ideas i think this was good for music and the students as well
149781 this changed my perception of music i saw how these guys have respect for their music whether it is classic or whatever they have all the time for it and the government puts money in it because it is their culture it is a big thing to just be ignored
149782 so when i came back in 2004 i asked myself what i was doing whether i was helping with our music at that point i decided that my music was going to change although i didnt know how
149783 but one day i was moving in kaunda square when i saw a young boy playing marimba xylophone like instrument and that is when i started learning how to play the marimba and now it is my main instrument in music
149784 sometime back i used to play at tongabezi in livingstone where the school organised a workshop there i learnt how to make the marimba and tune it for myself so i do make my own marimba now
149785 what has also helped me is the music of thomas mapfumo which some girl introduced me to although it is more of the mbira it has still helped in widening my knowledge of music and playing the keyboard as well
149786 but i also play the mbalule which is three drums i also play the bwita which is a friction drum i have these so it is easy to learn them

149865 that combined with a comment about his son made him lose his temper which he knows was entirely unacceptable
149866 you appear in front of the court on one charge
149867 it is very important that you no longer have a charge against you that is under the firearms act
149868 it is an assault charge and although it involves the use of an imitation firearm i think it is vitally important that the complainer knew it was fake
149869 nevertheless you inflicted an injury using it as a blunt weapon and it is a bad enough assault
149870 but taking into account that you dont have any other convictions for assault and that you have stayed out of trouble for a long time i think the appropriate way to deal with this is by means of a fine
