3120011 going up there with four guys we were really one
3120012 we all had to swim the perfect race and we swam that perfect race today

3120014 i think he likes the aspect of having it not be about him because so much of it is
3120015 i think he loves that he loves getting with those guys and he likes team sports he likes watching basketball and football this is the one time he gets to really be a part of something

3120018 lets create a splintered faction that says they wont vote obama but will instead vote mccain
3120019 when mccain unfairly attacks obama over and over how about we all just remain silent
3120020 hey hillary how about we leak a memo from your campaign camp about how you tried to smear obama during the primaries
3120021 yeah yeah we know but just say it was all mark penns doing
3120022 i have an idea its time for a sex scandal
3120023 what about john edwards he portrayed himself as a family man and his wife has cancer
3120024 no dennis were only looking for ideas to undermine ourselves
3120025 i know now that the edwards affair is public how about howard wolfson declare that if edwards had been out of the race before iowa hillary would now be our nominee
3120026 what about bob kerry making another comment about obama that helps mccain
3120027 howard i think when obama names his vp we should all argue over the choice in fact some of us should just say it downright stinks
3120028 how about we give hillary to mccain as his running mate
3120029 wonderful now for the final clincher what can it be

3120040 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
3120041 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

3120092 to understand the elimination of fear from my life i must appreciate the role of a thought because every feeling especially fear begins with a thought and every thought causes a feeling nothing else can cause a feeling
3120093 fear exhausts life energy fear causes the life force that ordinarily flows steadily through the nerves to be squeezed out and the nerves themselves become paralyzed the vitality of the whole body is lowered fear doesnt help you to get away from the object of fear it only weakens your will power
3120094 fear is the biggest problem we face on this planet
3120095 the worst that can happen to you is just a thought
3120096 i should have done this i should not have done that

3120109 in this telephone conversation they voiced their satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and in subsequent contact they described the trend of these negotiations as constructive
3120110 nothing has changed we stick to the two track approach the channels of communication remain open
3120111 on the one side pressure for sanctions in the united nations security council but also the offer of dialogue for the iranians to come to the table to discuss the package of incentives which has been proposed to them
3120112 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
3120113 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
3120114 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
3120115 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
3120116 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
3120117 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
3120118 i make a point of staying right at the edge of poverty i dont have a pair of pants without a hole in them and the only pair of boots i have are on my feet i dont mess around with unnecessary stuff so i dont need much money i believe its meant to be that way theres a struggle you have to go through and if you make a lot of money it doesnt make the struggle go away it just makes it more complicated if you keep poor the struggle is simple
3120119 now there is an increasingly powerful and vocal national movement to stop mountaintop removal
3120120 im saying were going to have it stopped by the end of next year the end of 2009
3120121 if the american people knew what was happening in appalachia i feel certain that they would demand an end to this practice
3120122 i think if we get a new president itll be stopped and i guess were going to get a new president by next year
3120123 i can tell you we havent had any significant permits issued since march 2007 because the court found that the federal government was illegally issuing permits at that time
3120124 how can they approve the filling of hundreds and a couple thousand miles of mountain streams in this region and say thats not significantly degrading the water
3120125 all i can say is the corps hasnt been doing its job up until now
3120126 i wouldnt be able to comment on what we think the 4th circuits going to rule but that appeal and those four individual permits do not affect the army corps ability to issue further individual permits and they have been doing that
3120127 the plaintiffs again have filed suit over those and that is still in litigation
3120128 have we issued any coal mining permits since the ruling yes we have do we feel it complies with the judges ruling yes we do
3120129 in the regulatory department we follow the rules and regulations as passed on to us by congress and the judges whatever they decide is what we will do we are neither for projects nor against projects
3120130 they would still be able to do traditional surface mining which is what we call contour surface mining where they mine around the mountains and reclaim the land when theyre done
3120131 they put the material back up into the mined area
3120132 it would be devastating and not just to southwest virginia counties it would impact washington county it would impact the tri cities area the coal dollar flows in lots of directions
3120133 when you live in a mountainous region sometimes you appreciate the flat land
3120134 weve got airports weve got housing developments weve got shopping centers because of land flattened by mining
3120135 one of the reasons we pushed so hard for circulating fluidized bed clean coal technology for this power station is its ability to burn a wide variety of fuels
3120136 we will be able to design our fuel plan around a wide range of coal waste coal and biomass and can make adjustments as the market for those fuels changes
3120137 the next administration could clarify the federal regulations and make it clear that mountaintop removal mining was never foreseen when the surface mining laws were passed and is not permitted under those laws
3120138 we can fight with agencies all we want but its going to take some will in washington to get things done
3120139 great i have saddle bags and my rings are twirling isnt that special
3120140 valley of decision as we often are asking myself if i could do better was i giving it my best i had to answer with a resounding no you can fool others but its a lot harder to fool yourself you know if you are doing the work or not

3120142 on the morning of december 10 1996 i woke up to discover that i had a brain disorder of my own
3120143 i have learned on my journey that the human spirit cannot be discounted the human spirit is something the doctors cant quantify it is something they cant give a statistic on but it is an amazing and incredible thing you cannot beat someone down who wants to triumph
3120144 how do you get through any crisis without an amazing network of friends who drop everything and will do whatever is needed to any one of you who thought about my family in rye n y or said a prayer i want to thank you all because i firmly believe that you all brought him back to us it really does take a village in a situation like this

3120157 as it is written none is righteous no not one no one understands no one seeks for god

3120209 ante el lamentable y reprobable hecho del secuestro y asesinato del ni o fernando mart las declaraciones de los funcionarios p blicos y de felipe calder n en el sentido de que la sociedad se conmovi con tan aberrante hecho nosotros creemos que es justo este sentimiento
3120210 que tambi n una gran parte de la sociedad sigue conmovida por los aberrantes hechos de aprehensi n desaparici n y asesinatos de luchadores sociales en el pa s por lo que si con el infamante asesinato del ni o fernando mart el sr calder n retoma su iniciativa para que se aplique la pena de muerte o la cadena perpetua esperamos que tambi n as env e su iniciativa de ley para que los responsables de los delitos de lesa humanidad que se cometen en contra de los luchadores sociales pagaran con la misma pena ya que quienes los cometen tienen nombre y apellido empezando por los gobernadores ulises ruiz de oaxaca mario mar n de puebla eduardo bours de sonora juan manuel oliva de guanajuato por poner algunos ejemplos

3120212 por otra parte la actitud de la mayor a de legisladores ante estos hechos es pasiva y vergonzante mientras con el aberrante secuestro y asesinato del ni o fernando mart se escandalizan no lo hacen con todas las personas que a diario son plagiadas y asesinadas en el pa s tampoco con la detenci n tortura encarcelamiento desaparici n forzada de los luchadores sociales y menos con nuestros compa eros desaparecidos edmundo reyes amaya y gabriel alberto cruz s nchez en cuyas personas tambi n se est n cometiendo cr menes de lesa humanidad y ante los cuales se callan por conveniencia pol tica

3120225 for one advertising uses a lot of sex as it is the second strongest of the psychological appeals 1st is self preservation its strength is biological and instinctive the genetic imperative of reproduction
3120226 it was a case of unconscious perception visual elements in the picture influenced my impression about it unconsciously leaving me with a negative attitude toward the advertisement when we form our opinions we do it extremely quickly and once we have it is very hard to change our impression sometimes in the face of contradictory facts

3120257 so i have come down to rescue them from the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land a land flowing with milk and honey

3120260 johns clothes were made of camels hair and he had a leather belt around his waist his food was locusts and wild honey
3120261 if you find honey eat just enough too much of it and you will vomit
3120262 honey frequently contains dormant endospores of the bacterium clostridium botulinum which can be dangerous to infants as the endospores can transform into toxin producing bacteria in the infants immature intestinal tract leading to illness and even death
3120263 for at least 2700 years honey has been used by the egyptians and also by modern humans to treat a variety of ailments through topical application but only recently have the antiseptic and antibacterial properties of honey been chemically explained wound gels that contain antibacterial honey and have regulatory approval for wound care are now available to help conventional medicine in the battle against drug resistant strains of bacteria mrsa as an antimicrobial agent honey may have the potential for treating a variety of ailments one new zealand researcher says a particular type of honey may be useful in treating mrsa infections antibacterial properties of honey are the result of the low water activity causing osmosis hydrogen peroxide effect and high acidity

3120270 without a doubt its the greatest olympic moment ive ever experienced or called head and shoulder above anything
3120271 it was something out of a hollywood script it had everything it had the guys that did the trash talking in the french it had the 32 year old swimmer in jason lezak who has not had successful olympic swims in the past trying to catch the world record holder in the 100 meters and doing it when it looked like he had no chance at all it was a crazy crazy moment
3120272 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3120273 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3120274 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3120275 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3120276 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3120277 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3120278 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3120279 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision

3120286 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3120287 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3120288 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3120289 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3120290 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3120291 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3120292 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe

3120309 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3120310 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3120311 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3120312 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3120313 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3120314 its not our beef because we dont have any beef anymore
3120315 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3120316 we want to make sure that especially people who have a history of violent offending or re offending sexual offenders are properly monitored
3120317 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
3120318 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3120319 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that itunes or any competing service couldnt
3120320 the guys rowed a really disciplined race and stayed focussed in our boat
3120321 this is the first time the americans have raced so it would be very foolish to think that this is all theyve got they are not olympic champions for nothing
3120322 the canadians will be the challenge on sunday without a shadow of a doubt
3120323 id love to have won today but id have got it in the neck if id have gone harder through the middle
3120324 we found a better and more efficient rhythm so that we could sprint the last 250 metres
3120325 its like a pair of eyes youre looking at the umlaut and its looking at you
3120326 when bolt ran 9 72 i realised that i had to run a 9 6 to beat him and thats what i trained my mind to do
3120327 the record can go and the guys can go 9 6
3120328 i did it with a lot of wind but i feel i can go there without wind this is one of the hottest 100s in history there hasnt been as much hype about it for a long time
3120329 thats just something im doing to show my love for the sport
3120330 i definitely understand that comes with the territory past champions have tested positive for drugs so the olympic champion does have to carry himself clean or should be clean and definitely able to prove it
3120331 i dont feel any aches or twitches ive been staying hydrated and im confident my body will hold up
3120332 i would have to say that bolt would be the favourite people may say he lacks experience at 100m but running 9 76 and 9 72 trumps experience tyson was in the shape of his life earlier this year but i think its going to be tough for him to come in and run the time he needs after a month off but that is not to say he cant win it
3120333 powell has shown it is very difficult for him to get it done on the days when it really counts
3120334 it would be devastating if that happened to him again so i think hes going to have a tremendous amount of pressure on him
3120335 every year we get students on the line who have missed their grades but who we can accept anyway or offer an alternative
3120336 when someone is in tears but you calm them down and sort something out its really satisfying
3120337 clearings a bit like shopping but students should consider who they phone and research courses properly before calling they may be relieved to be offered anything but they must make sure its the right place and course for them
3120338 dont just start ringing people look at websites first you must have some idea of where you want to go geographically and what you want to do in most areas there will be really valid courses even if theyre not ones that immediately spring to mind maybe youre set on doing media studies but what about multimedia film or photography
3120339 i think it helps involving students in answering the clearing lines because were not fulltime university staff so were not blinkered by financial issues or having to find people to fill specific courses i dont want to get a student into a course for the sake of it
3120340 many of georgias internet servers were under external control from late thursday
3120341 i have been pleasantly surprised at the number of 6th district residents who have been calling and emailing all of our offices urging me to participate in this important debate

3120360 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person i believe that its always best to be upfront with someone when you have strong opinions about their work or their image simply as a gesture of respect or if the respect isnt there then purely as professionalism had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask

3120371 we had a long night negotiating on some little hurdles and i thought i should raise my fist but he mbeki remained cool and said let us continue talking
3120372 it looks like we have reached some kind of stalemate which is threatening the whole dialogue
3120373 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3120374 this is an issue that we had settled and he tsvangirai is also suggesting that he must be given full authority to appoint any new government
3120375 the major hold up is the refusal by mugabe to cede his executive powers he is only agreeing to a nominal prime minister post for morgan tsvangirai
3120376 they zanu pf are also insisting that mutambara becomes one of the deputy prime ministers obviously that is not acceptable to us

3120413 findings from this study suggest the significant role that built environment plays in either positively or negatively impacting our health and or lifestyle
3120414 34 of u s adults aged 20 and over are obese part of the rise in this disease may be attributed to our surroundings for example increased accessibility to unhealthy foods the built environment is also creating barriers for our ability to exercise many neighborhood areas lack parks and other recreational facilities and suburbs are often designed to discourage neighborhood walking simply focusing on encouraging people to change their lifestyles to eat better and to get more exercise is insufficient measures are also needed to improve features of the built environment which are often modifiable e g via changes in city zoning development policies to support people in making such changes
3120415 our results are very important from a public health perspective
3120416 the u s population is aging rapidly and falls are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among adults age 65 and older falls are associated with an enormous burden to individuals society and to the health care system tai chi as a proven fall intervention may have much to offer in terms of reducing the public health burden of falls and the benefits accrued for prevention

3120422 theres a variety of tactics that employers have been employing over the last 3 to 6 years that has had an impact on the market
3120423 pretty much every employer has to do something or is doing something in an effort to bring that number down
3120424 it is encouraging that the growth in health care costs is going down but there is still more work to be done
3120425 when costs go up as great as this theres a lot of market pressure brought to bear on all of the parts of the market to bring those costs down and i think thats whats been happening over the last six years or so
3120426 they are resisting heavily they would like to make it firm to themselves that they should have those lands

3120623 oddly my post was picked up by antiwar com as a reference for conflict in the caucasus
3120624 i think that the attitude there is best described by what you see by driving in tskhinvali a very large billboard with a picture of vladimir putin on it which says vladimir putin our president i do not believe that vladimir putin is now or ever should be the president of sovereign georgian soil
3120625 is it really the role of a u s senator to decide what is and is not sovereign georgian soil
3120626 what seems like a small obscure dispute could balloon into a major crisis because of the stakes involved the rising amount of u s aid to georgia greatly aids georgian president saakashvilis military buildup his belligerence begs for a stern rebuke perhaps an aid cutoff its time to rein in this would be napoleon of the steppes and nip georgian imperialism in the bud before it destabilizes what is after all a volatile region if john mccain george soros anne applebaum and the usual neoconservative suspects have their way georgia may be the first battleground of a revived cold war the problem is that the conflict may turn hot with frightening swiftness

3120659 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
3120660 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3120661 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3120662 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3120663 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3120664 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3120665 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3120666 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3120667 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline
3120668 the u s should send immediate economic and humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the impact the invasion has had on the people of georgia
3120669 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3120670 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

3120684 chia seeds are said to have 2 times the protein of any other seed or grain 5 times the calcium of milk plus boron which is a trace mineral that helps transfer calcium into your bones 2 times the amount of potassium as bananas 3 times the reported antioxidant strength of blueberries 3 times more iron than spinach copious amounts of omega 3 and omega 6 which are essential fatty acids they are a complete source of protein providing all the essential amino acids in an easily digestible form they are also a fabulous source of soluble fibre one advantage of chia is that because it has such a high antioxidant content the seeds stay stable for much longer whereas flax for example may turn rancid chia seeds can easily be stored dry for 4 5 years without deterioration in flavour odour or nutritional value you can substitute chia in any recipe that calls for flax the taste of chia is very mild and pleasant that means you can easily combine it with other foods without changing the taste dramatically people add chia to their sauces bread batters puddings smoothies and more the flavour is retained plus masses more nutrition is added chia has been called a dieters dream food because when added to foods it bulks them up displacing calories and fat without diluting the flavour thus someone can eat a typical serving yet only consume about half the calories they might have eaten because the food has been bulked up with chia plus the eater gets a bellyful of nutrient rich superfood goodness which hydrates and sustains them magic other benefits of eating chia provides energy boosts strength bolsters endurance levels blood sugar induces weight loss aids intestinal regularity

3120687 good afternoon first of all id like to thank those members of the media who assembled here today it feels like ive had to give more than a few of these recently ive been in front of your faces so often in a way ive become
3120688 as for why ive called this latest in a long line of press conferences well i dont need to explain
3120689 id like to think that his outburst against manager charlie manuel was rooted in a healthy spirit of competitiveness a burning desire to stay out on that pitchers mound and get the job done i really would
3120690 but i think we all know the real reason for his brief tirade against charlie is that regrettably speaking my owner brett myers is an asshole a giant flaming concrete headed colon with legs
3120691 theres just no other way to say it im afraid for me to stand here before you again and try to explain away his behavior as youthful indiscretion would amount to nothing more than giving this cretin a get out of responsibility for your actions fuckface card
3120692 i know there are some of you out there in the press mr
3120693 i want you to know that while brett has undergone anger management counseling after the incident two years ago when he reportedly struck his wife on a boston street hes still a mean spirited self absorbed nutsucker
3120694 i lost track of exactly how many times that queef inhaling hothead has threatened to wipe me off his smug little bastardly face
3120695 i guess what im saying is i know how difficult it can be to tolerate this dickhead

3120697 i was thinking to day how dull and prosaic the study of mathematics is made in our school books as if the grand science of numbers had been discovered and perfected merely to further the purposes of trade
3120698 i do not see how you can make mathematics poetical there is no poetry in them
3120699 ah that is a very great mistake there is something divine in the science of numbers like god it holds the sea in the hollow of its hand it measures the earth it weighs the stars it illumines the universe it is law it is order it is beauty and yet we imagine that is most of us that its highest end and culminating point is book keeping by double entry it is our way of teaching it that makes it so prosaic

3120745 this newest iteration however is arguably more attractive than the s class against which it now competes though its a close call
3120746 this big sedan has a clean conservative yet absolutely contemporary shape accentuated by a forward thrusting arrowhead motif carried through from door handles to the front and rear lamp units and even the large unusual twin exhaust pipe diverters low in the rear bumper

3120778 i commend the hard work of the staff and volunteers at the capital area food bank and the other non profits i met with today
3120779 i was pleased to announce my support for legislation aimed at bringing relief specifically to non profits like the capital area food bank and their volunteers as they struggle with high energy and food prices the charitable mileage deduction equity act would increase the deduction rate for individuals who use their personal vehicles for charitable work this rate has not been updated in more than a decade im confident this legislation will go a long way toward encouraging the spirit of volunteerism that is central to the commendable efforts of non profit organizations
3120780 i will continue to work in congress to push for bipartisan action to address high food and fuel prices i support a temporary freeze on food to fuel mandates to allow food prices to return to an affordable level i also have been pushing for increased domestic energy production to bring down prices at the pump and make america more energy independent i hope congressional leaders will move swiftly to tackle these pressing issues

3120809 i believe god made me for a purpose but he also made me fast and when i run i feel gods pleasure
3120810 to give up running would be to hold him in contempt
3120811 more than anything else however we want to please him whether in our home here or there

3120815 as long as its in school time and there is someone at home for the children for the rest of the time

3120817 consistent with the norm that exists across society as a whole
3120818 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3120819 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3120820 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3120821 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3120822 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs

3120829 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
3120830 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
3120831 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
3120832 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so

3120844 however it has no significant impact on russias economic fundamentals and corporate earnings and at the end of the day we firmly believe this is what ultimately drives the markets rather then emotions and swings in investor sentiment
3120845 this conflict will have a negligible effect on the russian economy

3121044 to grow one pound of wheat requires only 60 pounds of water where as production of a pound of meat requires anywhere from 2 500 to 6 000 pounds of water
3121045 to derive 1kg of meat protein the animal has to be fed 7 8 kgs of vegetable protein it has also been estimated that to obtain 1 animal flesh calorie 7 vegetarian plant food calories have to be spent data compiled by the american agriculture department shows that the land needed to graze 1 average animal can sustain 5 average families of human beings
3121046 an average american consumes about 120 kgs of meat every year and to obtain it about 1000 kgs of food grains are fed to the animals if the same americans consume food grains directly then at least 8 people can be fed for a whole year with the same quantity as is required for flesh food for only 1 person professor george borgstorm has estimated that the amount of plant food fed to the animals in america alone would be enough to feed 1 2 the human population of the world

3121098 you always hear about ny being the city of dreams and hope and all that malarkey and i used to look down upon those people felt a little hurt that london with all its history culture and opportunity could not be associated with the same mental fascination and hope as the idea of going to new york did
3121099 well now my tables have turned i look down upon those people no more london is not like new york by any means sure they are both international cosmopolitan and indulgent but thats as far as it goes
3121100 this is not a general comment about new york and london
3121101 and my experience is based on 14 days barely worthy of anything everyone has their own take on each city its just that for a time london had seemed like the place i had wanted to live all my life
3121102 i thought this would be where i would make a living a family and die satisfied and happy but a couple of weeks in new york has made me take another route but they say five years and ny burns you out im hoping that will be the case

3121123 the fccs tests of prototype white space devices at fedex field prior to saturdays game conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmful interference to wireless microphones during live events
3121124 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
3121125 given the poor performance of these sensing devices there is no reason to believe that the other proposed protections such as beacons will be any more capable of providing reliable and robust interference protection to wireless microphone transmissions
3121126 these tests reveal fundamental deficiencies of sensing devices issues that cannot be pushed off with a promise to resolve these problems at some later time during certification testing
3121127 just as the bench testing has shown time and time again the science behind spectrum sensing is sound the current field tests including saturdays test at fedex field have done nothing to contradict the previous results
3121128 the fcc has the information it needs to move forward with their final report and the development of rules of the road for white space technologies
3121129 in particular standalone use of a geolocation database with a look up function would offer complete protection to digital tv and wireless microphone signals at major venues
3121130 importantly under our approach no wsd white spaces device would transmit even if it failed to detect any signals at all without first receiving affirmative permission from a geo location database look up
3121131 with or without spectrum sensing its abundantly clear that unlicensed devices can coexist successfully with licensed services with no reasonable fear of harmful interference

3121163 i love football and i always have loved football theres nothing else in this world that i would rather do than play football where else are you going to be able to hit people everywhere else youre going to jail for it

3121168 we decided that we wanted to start a company together emphasizing what we love to do in addition to what we do for a living
3121169 so we started talking about it and said lets create a company that emphasizes that balance were looking for in our lives
3121170 but at the same time the challenges have been good ones we started a year ago and were up and running

3121179 my gut tells me that had senator edwards dropped out of the race or had this become public prior to iowa that we would have done better in iowa
3121180 at the end of the day you can play the what if game endlessly and you can play both ways you know if senator clinton hadnt gotten teary eyed in new hampshire i think senator obama would have won new hampshire and he would have been the nominee in january so there are a thousand different ways you can play the what if game but i do believe that the result would have been different had this become public a year ago
3121181 you had some people in the campaign who want to try to get their side of the story out there and have leaked a lot of polling memos and other data it obviously reflects very badly on hillary that people did that i dont think that its indicative of the kind of president she would have been
3121182 look there were tensions within the campaign there were people who had disagreements about strategy and unfortunately what happens at the end of a losing campaign especially one that was as high profile as this is that this all gets played out in the media and you have a lot of people with scores to settle or reputations to help preserve and they want to put their side of the story out there
3121183 by and large the communications team got along well people that we had out on the road with senator clinton worked well with the people we had back in the headquarters in arlington
3121184 i dont think its useful to point fingers my attitude is that all of us in the senior leadership in the campaign bear at least some responsiblity for the outcome
3121185 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3121186 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3121187 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3121188 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3121189 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3121190 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3121191 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3121192 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3121263 this is primarily due to the following factors income taxes go down after retirement social security taxes end completely social security benefits are partially or fully tax free and saving for retirement is no longer needed
3121264 i should allow you the privilege of knowing that we are engaged in ongoing discussions
3121265 we actually have classes for sex education for parents through the health education system through social services and through the public school system
3121266 i also had an opportunity just two weeks ago since we ve been moved under labour to meet with the bahamas christian council
3121267 you re absolutely correct when you talk about the engagement of young children and i can tell you that even younger than grade 7 and 8 are actually engaging and expressing different things that they ve seen learnt or been exposed to and i ve spoken to this on numerous occasions
3121268 i said to the christian council the other day that we are all about the place talking about teen pregnancy but we are not getting to the core of the matter
3121269 when are we going to endorse the fact that our children are already exposed on so many levels why are we not teaching them from grade three the state minister said
3121270 i m telling you it has to be grade three it s not too young because you can do age appropriate teaching
3121271 we talked about the good touches and the bad touches and these kids are truly very aware of these things because either they ve been exposed to it through pornographic material their parents are watching or they re just watching it on the internet
3121272 the reality is that we as a people need to stop pretending like putting our heads in the sand like the proverbial ostrich and get real start addressing these issues allowing us to go into the schools and truly telling the truth to our children about the birds and the bees
3121273 as young people civic leaders political leaders and church leaders we have got to advocate because many times the church is the one that would say oh you teaching the children about sex now
3121274 when i went to private school as you did we were exposed to sex education from grade three and it was done in an age appropriate way
3121275 we have teachers in the system today that are not comfortable teaching sex education and that is one of our biggest drawbacks
3121276 i m not here to knock teachers but the reality is until we realize that these things are happening things will remain the same
3121277 we ve always had kids in the primary school engaging in sexual activity and based on our overall teen statistics we ve had persons as young as nine in our case clinic so we know that these activities are going on

3121390 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3121391 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3121392 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3121393 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3121394 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3121395 no theological grounds for condemning or prohibiting marriage between consenting adults merely because of racial origin
3121396 laws which prohibit inhibit or hamper marriage or cohabitation between persons because of different races religions or national origins should be nullified or repealed
3121397 as such she is prohibited from marrying a negro or any descendant of a negro a mongolian or an indian a malay or a hindu or any descendants of any of them likewise as a descendant of a negro she is prohibited from marrying a caucasian or a descendant of a caucasian
3121398 under the facts presented the appellant does not have the benefit of assailing the validity of the statute
3121399 there was a 448 per cent increase in the number of interracial marriages
3121400 if the only arguments against same sex marriage are sectarian then opposing the legalization of same sex marriage is invidious in a fashion no different from supporting anti miscegenation laws
3121401 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3121402 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3121403 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3121427 an objective account of this important development in modern jewish life
3121428 are united in their rejection of messianic judaism as an authentic expression of the jewish faith
3121429 pluralists maintain that the exclusion of messianic judaism from the circle of legitimate expressions of the jewish heritage is totally inconsistent
3121430 messianic jews are more theistically oriented and more torah observant even than their counterparts within the conservative and reform movements
3121431 messianic judaism should be seen merely as one among many expressions of the jewish faith alongside hasidism orthodox judaism conservative judaism reform judaism reconstructionist judaism and humanistic judaism
3121432 is the only reasonable starting point for inter community relations among jews in the twenty first century
3121433 yerushalayim yerushalayim you kill the prophets you stone those who are sent to you
3121434 if the world hates you understand that it hated me first
3121435 we have no idea how the rabbi got to this name of the messiah
3121436 it is hard for many good people in society to understand the person of the messiah
3121437 will all believe in the messiah right away no in the beginning some of us will believe in him and some not it will be easier for non religious people to follow the messiah than for orthodox people
3121438 the revelation of the messiah will be fullled in two stages first he will actively confirm his position as messiah without knowing himself that he is the messiah then he will reveal himself to some jews not necessarily to wise torah scholars it can be even simple people only then he will reveal himself to the whole nation the people will wonder and say what thats the messiah many have known his name but have not believed that he is the messiah
3121439 when he comes the messiah will rescue jerusalem from foreign religions that want to rule the city
3121440 they will not succeed for they will fight against one another
3121441 oh no thats blasphemy the people could understand that my father pointed to him the messiah of the christians
3121442 was called by emperor constantine to deal with the error of arianism see page 45 which was threatening the unity of the christian church
3121443 o lord god almighty i bless you and glorify you through the eternal and heavenly high priest jesus christ your beloved son through whom be glory to you with him and the holy spirit both now and forever
3121444 for in the name of god the father and lord of the universe and of our savior jesus christ and of the holy spirit they then receive the washing with water
3121445 in christ jesus our lord by whom and with whom be glory and power to the father with the holy spirit for ever
3121446 we have also as a physician the lord our god jesus the christ the only begotten son and word before time began but who afterwards became also man of mary the virgin for the word was made flesh being incorporeal he was in the body being impassible he was in a passable body being immortal he was in a mortal body being life he became subject to corruption that he might free our souls from death and corruption and heal them and might restore them to health when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts
3121447 the church though dispersed throughout the whole world even to the ends of the earth has received from the apostles and their disciples this faith one god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are in them and in one christ jesus the son of god who became incarnate for our salvation and in the holy spirit who proclaimed through the prophets the dispensations of god and the advents and the birth from a virgin and the passion and the resurrection from the dead and the ascension into heaven in the flesh of the beloved christ jesus our lord and his manifestation from heaven in the glory of the father to gather all things in one and to raise up anew all flesh of the whole human race in order that to christ jesus our lord and god and savior and king according to the will of the invisible father every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess to him and that he should execute just judgment towards all
3121448 we define that there are two the father and the son and three with the holy spirit and this number is made by the pattern of salvation which brings about unity in trinity interrelating the three the father the son and the holy spirit they are three not in dignity but in degree not in substance but in form not in power but in kind they are of one substance and power because there is one god from whom these degrees forms and kinds devolve in the name of father son and holy spirit
3121449 if anyone would say that the word of god or the wisdom of god had a beginning let him beware lest he direct his impiety rather against the unbegotten father since he denies that he was always father and that he has always begotten the word and that he always had wisdom in all previous times or ages or whatever can be imagined in priority there can be no more ancient title of almighty god than that of father and it is through the son that he is father
3121450 for if the holy spirit were not eternally as he is and had received knowledge at some time and then became the holy spirit this were the case the holy spirit would never be reckoned in the unity of the trinity i e along with the unchangeable father and his son unless he had always been the holy spirit
3121451 moreover nothing in the trinity can be called greater or less since the fountain of divinity alone contains all things by his word and reason and by the spirit of his mouth sanctifies all things which are worthy of sanctification

3121474 the companys revenues result from the licensing of intellectual property which by its very nature is directly affected by the timing of the closure of licence agreements the nature and extent of specific licences including actual rates product sales by licensees which can be subject to seasonality as well as overall market demands and the timeliness of the receipt of licensee royalty reports

3121591 las sectas existen tambi n entre nosotros preocupan y ocupan porque frecuentemente la manera de hacerse adeptos es a trav s de un sistema de proselitismo
3121592 las sectas tienen otra connotaci n se llaman grupos que se han separado bajo la influencia de un l der que de alguna manera dicta los criterios y las normas de organizaci n y generalmente manipulan las conciencias de las personas
3121593 si la iglesia cat lica ejerciera proselitismo ser a condenable proselitismo es comprar las conciencias de las personas es querer enga ar a la gente para que forme parte del grupo al que yo pertenezco
3121594 dar testimonio de tal forma que la conducta que manifiesten atraiga a m s fieles
3121595 las sectas protestantes ganan cada d a m s terreno y esto es de verdad preocupante
3121596 las sectas protestantes ganan cada d a m s terreno y es que es de verdad preocupante pues las estad sticas nos marcan que van en aumento el xii censo de poblaci n y viviendo del inegi nos dice que el 88 2 de los mexicanos son miembros de la iglesia cat lica mientras que el 5 2 lo es de iglesias protestantes de donde sobresalen los testigos de jehov con un 1 2 el 0 6 son adventistas del s ptimo d a por otro lado el 3 5 se declaran sin religi n tal vez en proporci n podemos pensar que a n les falta mucho por alcanzarnos pero en realidad conforme van pasando los a os van cada d a m s en aumento la mayor a de las personas que va a tocar las puertas de nuestras casas han sido cat licos y en su gran mayor a tienden a hablar mal de la iglesia cat lica qu es lo que sucede qu lleva a estas personas a atacar sin tregua a la iglesia los evang licos cuentan con dos millones trescientos mil feligreses es decir poco m s del 51 de los que se enmarcan en la categor a de protestantes y evang licas en cuanto a los testigos de jehov gracias a su organizaci n empresarial y a su proselitismo sistem tico realizado especialmente a trav s de las visitas domiciliarias ha logrado sacar de nuestras filas a poco m s de un mill n de cat licos los mormones se encuentran muy por debajo de los testigos de jehov y de los adventistas del s ptimo d a y finalmente quedan los que se declaran sin religi n que tambi n van m s en aumento no podemos ser eternamente indiferentes a los cat licos que se alejan de la iglesia en efecto si las sectas crecen no es por generaci n espont nea crecen precisamente a costa de los cat licos es necesario educar a nuestro pueblo en la tolerancia el respeto a la libertad de conciencia y a la libertad religiosa conscientes de que en este nuevo contexto que vivimos urge delinear el nuevo rostro del cat lico orgulloso de formar parte de la nica iglesia que fund cristo y al mismo tiempo respetuoso de aquellos que profesen otra creencia religiosa piensen distinto o se declaren sin religi n

3121613 they are being saddled with growing debt that drives them underground to somewhere no one wants them
3121614 if theyre in prison the child support clock keeps ticking
3121615 social welfare policy should be changed so that the man is recognized as an asset
3121616 that would change some of the dynamic in our communities that is so dysfunctional
3121617 the idea is to make it real that this obligation matters
3121618 i like to play a game with my son joseph
3121619 dont worry dad a family of dorks will come along any minute

3121621 was it over when the germans bombed pearl harbor hell no
3121622 people who wear crocs go on and on about how comfortable they are and how its supposedly odor resistant because its made out of some kind of anti bacterial foam you know what else its resistant to you getting laid
3121623 im terrified of clowns there is no way im seeing this one i wont make it through

3121630 the people who are 80 are so much like the 6 year olds i can hear such wisdom out of the mouth of a 6 year old and i can sometimes hear such a need from an older person
3121631 we shouldnt be trying to raise our test scores above alabamas state sen eric johnson pointed out in a recent speech on education we are not competing with alabama anymore georgia should be trying to raise them above austrias and south koreas as a statement of goals the senator is exactly right he recognizes that our children will have to compete in a global marketplace against the best and brightest from around the world if they are to continue to enjoy the quality of life that america has provided their parents
3121632 senate president pro tem eric johnson advocates a destroy the town to save it approach to public education in georgia in his push for universal vouchers the savannah republican maintains that diverting students from public classrooms into private ones and diverting tax dollars in the same direction will somehow mysteriously improve public schools voucher experiments in other states dont support that conclusion

3121635 parents who want to help their children should be prepared to play an active role in their kids first job searches
3121636 if youre a successful executive chances are good that you have many skills and contacts you can share with your son or daughter
3121637 think about people who you can connect them with and helpful advice you can offer about their job searches
3121638 coach them on preparing fully for meetings and being ready to describe their strengths and interests remind them to dress appropriately maintain good eye contact and turn off their cell phones during appointments
3121639 taking advice from mom or dad doesnt always go smoothly so think about successful business friends or colleagues who might be willing to guide your child and give him or her some tips and advice
3121640 especially helpful are contacts who have management experience and or human resources insights
3121641 its surprising how few students really take advantage of the placement services their colleges or universities offer
3121642 the ideal time to connect with the placement office is in the students sophomore or junior year so parents should remind current college students to begin exploring the resources offered early in their college careers

3121808 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3121809 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3121810 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3121811 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3121812 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3121814 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3121815 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3121816 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3121817 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3121818 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3121819 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3121820 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3121822 industrial countries are largely responsible for the global climate crisis the world now faces
3121823 but recent emissions trends demonstrate that it will require an active partnership between industrial and developing countries if the climate is to be stabilized

3121836 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3121837 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3121838 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
3121839 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
3121840 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
3121841 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
3121842 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
3121843 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

3121845 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3121846 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3121853 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
3121854 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
3121855 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
3121856 seguramente los ministros se equivocaron pero apelen a la corte suprema y seguramente all les va a ir bien
3121857 we as republicans truly believe in a comprehensive bill that includes renewables and drilling

3121866 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
3121867 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
3121868 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
3121869 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
3121870 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
3121871 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas

3121875 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
3121876 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
3121877 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
3121878 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
3121879 hey hows it going you guys wanna get coffee and just talk maybe
3121880 truth or consequence say it aloud use that evidence race it around
3121881 however the fda continues to receive reports of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated concurrently with amiodarone and simvastatin particularly with simvastatin doses greater than 20 mg daily
3121882 and they should avoid doses of simvastatin greater than 20 mg per day in patients taking amiodarone
3121883 we have shown that children aged between 7 and 15 who had low birth weights are more likely to be salt sensitive have increased blood pressure with higher intakes of salt than children of the same age who did not have low birth weights also children who had low birth weights had smaller kidneys than those with normal birth weights which may explain why they are salt sensitive
3121884 our study sheds some light on why that may be of course these children may have other complications that could also contribute to their higher cardiovascular risk but i would say after our study that smaller kidneys leading to salt sensitivity is probably one reason
3121885 i think we can now make a strong recommendation that care needs to be taken with the salt intake of low birth weight infants and this is something that needs to be continued lifelong these children need to avoid excessive salt intake it is likely that fast food will be more harmful to them than to children who had normal birth weights infants with low birth weights frequently come from complicated pregnancies with the mother suffering from preeclampsia and these mothers also have an increased cardiovascular risk so the mother can be counseled about dietary issues for both herself and her child if the mother instigates a healthy lifestyle both mother and child will benefit
3121886 theres nearly a 50 chance of favorably affecting blood pressure by simply reducing salt intake in children born small for their gestational age and nearly a 40 chance for those born with low birth weight these individuals can be determined very easily if their family physician just gets data on their births
3121887 the investigation into the fictitious return address on envelopes used for the second round of anthrax mailings 4th grade greendale school has established a possible link to the american family association afa headquartered in tupelo mississippi in october 1999 ma a christian organization published an article entitled afa takes wisconsin to court the article describes a lawsuit filed in federal court by the afa center for law and policy clp on behalf of the parents of students at greendale baptist academy the article focuses on an incident that occurred on december 16 1998 in which case workers of the wisconsin department of human services went to the greendale baptist academy in order to interview a fourth grade student the case workers acting on an anonymous tip that greendale baptist academy administered corporal punishment as part of its discipline policy did not disclose to the staff why they wanted to interview the student the case workers interviewed the student in the absence of the students parents and informed the school staff that the parents were not to be contacted the afa clp filed suit against the wisconsin department of human services citing a violation of the parents fourth amendment rights
3121888 redacted donations were made to the afa in the name of mr and mrs bruce ivins on eleven separate occasions beginning on december 31 1993 after an approximate two year break in donations the next donation occurred on november 11 1999 one month after the initial article referencing greendale baptist academy was published in the afa journal it was also discovered that the subscription to the afa journal in the name of mr amp mrs bruce ivins was active until march 2005
3121889 when investigators asked ivins for an anthrax sample he thought they were asking for a pure culture sample it wasnt until six weeks later that they called and said they had wanted something else
3121890 never denied to the fbi that the anthrax could have come from his batch
3121891 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas and have just decreed death to all jews and all americans language similar to the anthrax letters warning we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
3121892 glenn reminds me that it was the anthrax attacks that took the post 9 11 sense of threat to a whole new level and moved the iraq invasion forward as a possible response that we now think the threat was actually a domestic source with no connection with islamism is a critical piece of historical adjustment
3121893 the sophisticated form of anthrax delivered to tom daschles office forces us to ask a simple question what are these people trying to do i think theyre testing the waters they want to know how we will respond to what is still a minor biological threat as a softener to a major biological threat in the coming weeks they must be encouraged by the panic mongering of the tabloids hollywood and hoaxsters they must also be encouraged by the fact that some elements in the administration already seem to be saying we need to keep our coalition together rather than destroy the many headed enemy so the terrorists are pondering their next move the chilling aspect of the news in the new york times today is that the terrorists clearly have access to the kind of anthrax that could be used against large numbers of civilians my hopes yesterday that this was a minor attack seem absurdly na ve in retrospect so they are warning us and testing us at this point it seems to me that a refusal to extend the war to iraq is not even an option we have to extend it to iraq it is by far the most likely source of this weapon it is clearly willing to use such weapons in the future and no war against terrorism of this kind can be won without dealing decisively with the iraqi threat we no longer have any choice in the matter
3121894 slowly incrementally a rubicon has been crossed the terrorists have launched a biological weapon against the united states they have therefore made biological warfare thinkable and thus repeatable we once had a doctrine that such a rubicon would be answered with a nuclear response we backed down on that threat in the gulf war but saddam didnt dare use biological weapons then someone has dared to use them now our response must be as grave as this new threat
3121895 this is one of the largest studies in 13 000 people followed for an average of eight years and is the first study to explore the association between vitamin d levels and mortality in the overall population this makes our results more generalizable
3121896 this suggests to us that maybe if vitamin d is playing a role in cvd it is acting before the disease is established
3121897 this suggests that like anything in the body there is an optimum level of vitamin d
3121898 they should definitely be checked in people at risk of osteoporosis and perhaps in the other subgroups who are at risk of vitamin d deficiency such as women those with high bmi and ethnic minorities
3121899 we found that among all the patients discharged from the hospital with heart failure in this study only 12 of chf patients are discharged with crt and of all those patients with ejection fractions less than 35 who did not already have a crt device implanted only 5 were given such a device this is surprising as we know that 30 to 50 of chf patients have long qrs intervals and low ejection fractions and are therefore eligible for crt therapy so our results suggest this technology is not being used extensively enough
3121900 specifically we found that quite a few patients with ejection fractions above 35 were given crt but no trials have shown a benefit in such patients
3121901 other things we found were that elderly patients were less likely to receive crt as were african americans and the use of crt varied with the geographical region the patient lived in all these observations are worrisome as they suggest that this technology is not being used as much as it should be and it is not always being used in the right patients
3121902 but this would not reflect all the disparity that we found
3121903 for the older patients it may be the case that other factors such as comorbidities may influence the decision to use crt but we found that after controlling for other comorbidities age was still an independent factor associated with less use of crt
3121904 our message is that crt is a powerful therapy that has been associated with a 50 reduction in hospitalization and a 30 reduction in all cause mortality we should be making every effort to ensure that patients who meet the criteria for crt get such a device regardless of their age race or where they live and we should be careful that we are not using these devices in patients in whom they have not been shown beneficial
3121905 we wanted to investigate why some obese people are still insulin sensitive while others with a similar body mass are insulin resistant
3121906 we found that the most harmful fat distribution pattern in obese people was that of high liver fat followed by high intramyocellular muscle fat visceral fat is also bad but not as bad as liver or muscle fat
3121907 this suggests that these patients have a relatively benign obesity
3121908 i am not saying that it is okay to be obese it is still not as healthy as being normal weight even if you have the relatively benign type of obesity but it is still desirable to be able to identify those obese patients with the highest risk of diabetes and heart disease i would tell all obese patients to try to lose weight with diet and exercise but i would go one step further and consider pharmacological treatment or other measures as well for those who are showing the high risk profile of obesity
3121909 the problem is that we cannot easily identify individuals with high levels of liver and muscle fat this needs to be done with mri scans and these are expensive so it is not feasible to do this for all obese patients so for the time being for clinical practice waist circumference gives us some idea of risk and more information can be ascertained from taking blood insulin measurements with the highest levels of insulin signifying highest risk this is probably the best easy measurement to give a good idea of risk so waist and insulin measurements are a good start but i would still advocate mri scans of obese patients with a family history of diabetes or heart disease to identify those at highest risk
3121910 among us adults there is a high prevalence of clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities among normal weight individuals and a high prevalence of overweight and obese individuals who are metabolically healthy
3121911 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3121912 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform
3121913 intel provides the vast majority of chipsets for its processors and following its purchase of ati amd is also moving very quickly in the same direction
3121914 even if all the while theyre making cryptic little remarks specifically designed to keep you up at night wondering what they could possibly mean
3121915 forty fighters surrounded our house and for more than 45 minutes my bodyguards and i engaged them
3121916 they shot my house with six rpgs they burned the house they stole five cars they destroyed everything and then kidnapped me and held me for five days
3121917 if the americans withdrawal quickly all the troops from iraq there will be a bad situation
3121918 yes you will see no one wearing their uniforms in baghdad
3121919 we cant make all the society police and soldiers we are against that
3121920 youre not building for the future here this is a candidate whos lost provincially lost federally and is what 62 63 years old
3121921 to create the political will that it will take to make sure that the people that are here when the olympics start are the people that are here when the olympics are done
3121922 is that it can be used as a tool to eliminate a population that the city doesnt want here right now because of what they say the land value is we support chicago getting the bid but not on our backs
3121923 right now there is no place for us as a whole to even be a part of this
3121924 how can you bring the olympics here when my boys go to doolittle elementary school and they dont have a computer lab they dont have a music room the olympics is not going to do anything for my boys right now
3121925 how can a city that has been condemned by the united nations for allowing its police to engage in systematic torture of black men be worthy of hosting the olympic games
3121926 daley and his cronies have yet to learn the lesson that you cannot brutalize black men with impunity
3121927 look at the current rash of police shootings and brutality in our communities if we have to deny daley the object of his desire to teach that lesson so be it
3121928 if you become complacent computers will really screw you up
3121929 never put anything on a computer you wouldnt want the whole world to see because they will see it
3121930 this version of outlook cannot be run over terminal services
3121931 we are committed to delivering value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner possible
3121932 during our efforts to spin off our biotechnology business it became clear that we should also explore attractive opportunities for enzons other businesses our decision to explore alternatives for our specialty pharmaceuticals business is an outgrowth of that thinking and has the potential to allow enzon to focus exclusively on our novel biotechnology business as an alternative to our previously announced spin off
3121933 i am so happy to join with commissioner easterly in promoting easy things that children and adults can do around the house to help themselves and the environment
3121934 these two new initiatives make sense for families to save money while keeping our air water and land clean
3121935 multiply a small change by the six million hoosiers living in indiana and you create a large state wide impact
3121936 one of the easiest things someone can do is switch from a regular incandescent light bulb to a compact florescent light bulb or cfl cfls use 75 percent less energy and last 10 times longer than regular incandescents they are the perfect example of a small simple change in our normal habits that can have a big impact when they are multiplied
3121937 the college is very grateful to lilly endowment for its generous and vital support of the wabash center for teaching and learning in theology and religion
3121938 wabash is very proud of the work of the wabash center as the founding vision of dr raymond williams and the hospitality of dr lucinda huffaker continues to be enacted so ably by dr nadine dena pence and her fine staff
3121939 by awarding us this grant lilly endowment has re affirmed its commitment to and confidence in the work of the wabash center
3121940 the endowments generosity will enable us to continue to do work that no one else is doing to encourage excellence in teaching in the schools of theology and departments of religion across north america
3121941 it is stunning to hear the gratitude and praise from former workshop and colloquy participants
3121942 they talk about the tremendous richness of the experience and how it has shaped their teaching in vital ways perhaps the most indelible parts of each workshop are the friendships that are made with colleagues who now span the united states and canada in a diversity of schools
3121943 kau tidak akan tahu apa yang akan terjadi kalau kau membunuhnya atau tidak membunuhnya
3121944 the players have to find and help a friend who has been drinking and whose condition is constantly deteriorating
3121945 as a result of this rather surprising media attention we have decided to remove the option of purchasing diet pills from the game
3121946 so lets all pretend again there are no diet pills in the world and thus there is absolutely no reason to discuss about them
3121947 computer and video games in formal and informal educational contexts
3121948 the first thing i was struck by when logging into the service was that my bimbo a looker kitted out only in her white knickers was already almost a stone overweight
3121949 players are moral agents and they do play a significant role in the moral construction of the game as an ethical experience this means that players are no more the victims of systems designed to conditioned them and turn them into mindless zombies players have an ethical understanding of the game which implies increasing their responsibility in the moral landscape of computer games because players are moral agents and do behave as such games have to take that into consideration allowing for players to develop their moral judgment in the game experience and through the game community
3121950 nom sou partid rio de colaborar com os nacionalistas nem trato com eles
3121951 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do

3121954 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3121955 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3121956 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3121957 i think its important to show what kids really use
3121958 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3121959 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3121960 the band has always put an effort into making the audience feel like an extension of arnocorps and to participate and rock out with us on stage
3121961 you cant interact with a movie but you can interact with arnocorps
3121962 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees
3121963 touring with the roots was something weve wanted to do for a while and were real excited its finally happening and estelle opening things up its over tour of the year fans are in store for a real special treat who knows whats gonna happen out there
3121964 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us

3121980 the proposed structure more equally distributes country weights within three defined tiers which are rebalanced annually based on country market capitalizations

3121991 not being picked to go to the sydney olympics in 2000 after having beaten the best women in britain was a real low point
3121992 i have continued my push toward fair fuel prices in the north with a letter to jim prentice late last week i would like the minister to address the negative impact that regional price gouging has on our regions competitiveness the difference of 20 cents per litre that is regularly witnessed between north and south is seriously eroding the viability of our northern businesses whether its in tourism transportation forestry agriculture or mining
3121993 as we move toward winter the rising cost of fuel is weighing heavy on the minds of our constituents who use oil or natural gas to heat their homes i believe this winter will be the most difficult on record for those families who bare the brunt of high fuel cost through home heating bills
3121994 las palabras deben servir para aportar soluciones y no para exacerbar las pasiones mal entendidas
3121995 di logo trabajo y si hay voluntad pol tica acuerdo subrayando que desde luego el gobierno tiene esa voluntad pol tica y va a tratar de buscar el acuerdo
3121996 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3121997 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3121998 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3121999 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3122000 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3122001 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3122002 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3122003 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3122004 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3122005 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act

3122012 if a more senior lawyer gets a negative annual review that person will often be slated for a midyear review so that progress can be checked after six months not just annually and so that the firm makes sure it is doing all it can in terms of additional training and mentoring
3122013 what were doing is being harder in our performance review process people who are viewed as not performing have been given the opportunity to find another job
3122014 we will not make layoffs we feel wed rather take the hit during a downturn than get rid of people because there isnt enough work to do
3122015 certainly nothing targeting one area or another our real estate department is not that large to begin with and they stay busy

3122018 may those spirits that work such things please accompany the people involved in this accident amen
3122019 heh what did they expect they copied content from other site
3122020 are scratching their heads wondering what happened to all those chain smokers who were supposed to help balance marylands budget last year the legislature doubled the cigarette tax to 2 a pack to pay for expanded health care coverage eight months later cigarette sales have plunged 25 and the state is in fiscal distress again
3122021 made it a crime for residents to carry two packs of cigarettes that werent purchased in the state in other words the state says its legal to smoke so long as you use cigarettes that the government can tax and thus become a financial partner in your bad habit but if you dare to buy smokes across state lines you can be fined
3122022 i thought that one of the motivations for our federal constitution was to prevent one state from taxing another states imports into that state barring those purchases entirely is an astounding reach of state power
3122023 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
3122024 full implementation of electronic health records systems and the statewide interoperable electronic health records network by january 1 2015

3122026 i applaud the many important initiatives that this legislation enacts to enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of health care in the commonwealth
3122027 i train really hard youve got to take the emotional part out of it committing to exercise is sort of like a marriage sometimes you think i dont want to talk to you or be around you but then you communicate and resolve it
3122028 women especially dont put as great a value on themselves they take care of other people your health and feeling good about yourself is really critical exercise isnt about being thin there really is chemical stuff that happens it helps you stay sane
3122029 sure there are days when i take a shower and put my gym clothes on and then walk around in them the whole day

3122038 the eu has influence over russia russia does want to be accepted as a legitimate member of the international community it is of course a member of the g8 the un security council it wants to be a member of the world trade organization it wants to have special privileged relations with the eu and with nato so it does care about what the world thinks
3122039 it needs to emphasize to russia that it should not use the conflict over south ossetia and now abkhazia to wage a bigger broader conflict against georgia itself and again we do have influence to make sure that doesnt happen
3122040 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her
3122041 she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3122042 were working on him they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3122043 he told his wife that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
3122044 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
3122045 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the pre eminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
3122046 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
3122047 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
3122048 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
3122049 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
3122050 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
3122051 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
3122052 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man

3122093 but when i opened it up and exposed the wing i just went wow i found another bat
3122094 at first we couldnt really see legs or a tail but once we put two of the x rays together and looked at it in the light we could see where the tail was and how the legs were kind of sunk back
3122095 then we cleaned another digit off and exposed another claw and we knew normal bats didnt have all those claws i was so thrilled because it was right in the center of a big rock
3122096 it was really very important to me that this bat went to science rather than to a private collector
3122097 i wanted this to be in a museum and being that this bat was so different we thought it certainly needed to be studied by experts
3122098 we look for the small stuff our whole objective is to not throw anything away
3122099 i dont know how we do it except that we seem to have a good eye for it and a good feel for it
3122100 most museums are full of fossils from the green river formation so were looking for the new stuff because the odds of getting a new species are so slim for museums
3122101 as a result we have a good relationship with museums around the world they like fossil hunters because its the commercial diggers that find all the new stuff
3122102 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3122103 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3122104 i asked her as details on the verification have yet to be decided can i take it that the delisting wont happen today
3122105 if things go right we can start talking about forever
3122106 i expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay proprietary free after the week is over because they will discover what we already know linux foss and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in redmond and cupertino
3122107 the lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of microsofts biggest advantages inertia
3122108 if not for the event people would just continue using microsoft products because thats what they have always been using and they would be afraid to try something new on their own
3122109 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
3122110 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
3122111 great but can i get one without lotus notes too
3122112 to paraphrase yoda notes leads to anger anger leads to notes consultants notes consultants lead to suffering
3122113 2008 will be known as the year of lotus notes on the desktop
3122114 this is a perfect example on why ibm stays ahead they adapt
3122115 they went from proprietary to open from dos to linux from punch cards to computers despite how old ibm seems they always seem to adapt something that some tech companies refuse to do
3122116 one of the weak points of linux desktops over the years has been access to viable let alone powerful productivity applications
3122117 ibms lotus suite has been around for years is used by billions worldwide and is well understood and well established
3122118 for red hat novell and canonical being able to leverage lotus on desktop pcs is a real opportunity
3122119 if a company is thinking of moving to a new platform this mixture of ibm and these partners gives it some options for having a solid business productivity experience with linux that would not necessitate the purchase of either vista or new hardware to support it
3122120 although this is our first case of 2008 we know that conditions have been favorable for west nile virus
3122121 we recommend that our residents take precautions when going outside at dawn or dusk
3122122 wear long sleeves insect repellent and make sure there are no sources of standing water on your property
3122123 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3122124 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3122125 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3122126 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3122127 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3122128 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3122129 its a new venture were going into i cant say more at this time
3122130 when they approached us they didnt give us a lot of information
3122131 there was a lot of wildlife some nesting eagles beautiful woods
3122132 that presents a compelling investment opportunity in a solid century old company
3122133 trading at a more normal 12 14 times earnings would put the share price between 38 and 44 a gain of 50 percent to 75 percent from current levels
3122134 we have been looking at equipment for months but havent signed a deal to buy it yet
3122135 we are looking at the best available technology as it changes so fast we have 18 months to get under construction so we are going to make the right choices even if it takes a little longer
3122136 its a done deal the only thing we have left as a recourse is to hound them and make sure they are operating in the limits of the law and when they violate it bring them to task
3122137 i have the same misgivings about the asphalt plant as i have the rest of the operation
3122138 its going to reflect negatively on st thomas township as soon as it fires up there are going to be complaints downwind
3122139 your vote consolidated the process of change we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalisation
3122140 the democratic and cultural revolution undertaken by the brotherly bolivian people
3122141 the results tell us that the situation wont change there are no conditions for an end to the crisis
3122142 the confrontation is over the dht direct hydrocarbon tax because if they the opposition governors have no resources autonomy will mean nothing
3122143 the discussion between the two parties were frank and positive they discussed the progress made by iraq and especially that of the iraqi governments success in security and the future reconstruction projects
3122144 because it works tracy mcgrady loved when rap fans booed him and performed on a higher level based on it vince lets fans get in his head and it has a effect in a bad way on his performance so keep booing v c till he gives us a reason to stop
3122145 i mean youve got a guy like marvin williams who comes out of north carolina and wins the championship coming off the bench and maybe averaging eight points and hes a no 2 pick in 2005 i mean thats whats crazy to me
3122146 i personally would very much like to see that project go forward but itll only happen if it works with the climate action plan
3122147 at this point graymont has very serious concerns in going forward with the proposed plant due to uncertainty about the provinces regulatory approach on greenhouse gases
3122148 the company has made the point and i think its a valid one that the lime process is the same and the emissions are the same everywhere
3122149 any new industry that helps diversify the prince george economy is welcome from my perspective

3122159 she wants to raise taxes so she can give hardworking peoples money to other people and i dont like mccain because of the war
3122160 weve already won the war in iraq the president is decreasing deployment time and has started to bring troops home
3122161 you know she sounds like the kind of person who forgets whats really important some people they think if they dont spend 26 hours a day at their desk and they miss a call the worlds going to collapse i have all kinds of patients here some are big shot lawyers who work all the time making calls and deals and such one guy i know nice guy he got leukemia and died soon after three days later someones sitting at his desk doing his work i did what i had to do to take care of my family but now i do this because i like it i like people its nice to feel important but sometimes we forget no one is irreplaceable

3122166 people might want to do better with their health but the lack of money the lack of medical care and the lack of access in low income neighborhoods to healthy foods and safe physical activity are the things that low income people in fresno and the valley areas face
3122167 bottom line if youre poor or a minority you are potentially in trouble health wise california needs to renew its efforts at seeking a solution to our lack of health insurance overall
3122168 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
3122169 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3122170 restoration of chaperone mediated autophagy in aging liver improves cellular maintenance and hepatic function
3122171 weve managed to offload an incredible amount of spending onto government but done so in a way that ensures the government cant use its size or regulatory power to cut spending growth or produce a manageable moral health system
3122172 its not at all clear that when people dont buy health insurance they are imposing costs on the rest of us
3122173 would remove the employers incentive to provide coverage and could potentially unravel the current system
3122174 buttress the traditional source of health insurance which is employers
3122175 libertarians may have plenty of other grounds to criticize mccain on but on health care mccain is advocating a libertarian vision
3122176 r ather than creating a special plan just for the 130 000 uninsured why not use the tax money to subsidize the purchase of health insurance plans that already exist in the marketplace isnt that a better use of resources
3122177 people were probably saying to themselves here is memphis the buckle on the bible belt and isaac hayes is coming out onstage dressed as black moses
3122178 if you notice that album opened out with flaps kind of like a crucifix that was seen as pretty heavy for those times and that was the mystique about him wearing those chains
3122179 the first few shows i did with him he didnt wear the chains
3122180 but then he started wearing them and i think it represented to him the coming freedom of the black man
3122181 his music represented an identity of what it meant to be black
3122182 it was exciting in a kind of strength of course it all coincided with the civil rights movement and for a musician his was a different image coming out there onstage with no shirt and those chains man it was a whole other world
3122183 i remember we had been on the road and he came offstage and people were howling and grabbing for him and one of the musicians said man you are the black moses people will follow you anywhere it was really radical
3122184 so everything you hear on his albums he had hummed to himself first
3122185 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned

3122212 any kind of relief or help we can get from a cheaper source of oil could impact the agricultural industry tremendously throughout the country throughout the world
3122213 but certainly we have the ability and we have shown that over and over again that we can beat people on technology and applying that technology

3122217 advancing policies that limit u s energy production and supplies puts our national security in jeopardy and costs american families and businesses dearly

3122219 fighting high energy prices isnt a partisan issue its one every american must take up
3122220 i appreciate americans for prosperitys recognition of my efforts to bring relief to hard working families i will continue my work to advocate for producing more american energy as the first step towards bringing down the price at the pump

3122227 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia
3122228 georgia is an ancient country at the crossroads of eastern europe and central asia and one of the worlds first nations to adopt christianity as an official religion
3122229 following fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2003 a peaceful democratic revolution took place led by the u
3122230 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
3122231 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3122232 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3122233 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3122234 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3122235 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3122236 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3122237 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3122238 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline
3122239 nobody likes making cuts but the nations current rate of spending and the decreased tax revenues weve seen since implementing my tax cuts have created a deficit that we cant afford to carry
3122240 someone had to have the vision leadership and courage to go in and erase that line altogether no matter how unpopular and impossible that may be
3122241 bush has taken a brave step one that was long overdue
3122242 he has taken charge of the budget problem once and for all simply by saying the deficit stops here
3122243 i was staring at the figure for the deficit and i decided that it simply could not stand
3122244 it was too high something had to be done but americans have been taxed and taxed i say enough taxes by my estimation this historical crossing out of the deficit will save american taxpayers millions billions and perhaps even bajillions of dollars
3122245 my fellow americans i have solved the federal budget crisis
3122246 i dont know why i didnt have this idea before
3122247 for years we have tried to control the deficit by eliminating federal programs lowering taxes for the rich sending out checks to everybody and god knows what else none of us once thought to just draw a line through it
3122248 president bush drew a line through the deficit yes and we commend him for that
3122249 but that doesnt solve the countrys budgetary problems while he was at it why didnt he add several zeroes to the end of our gnp
3122250 opinions vary as to what the long term effects of the deficit cut will be
3122251 one thing however is certain the growing federal deficit a gordian knot that for three years no amount of cutting taxes and spending money could unravel has been sliced in two by the presidents bold radical new take on the problem
3122252 im tired of the tax and spend democrats always talking about adding zeroes to the gnp
3122253 how about we cross out our debts and get our affairs in order before we start adding zeroes we need to cut this deficit and stand firm against printing deficits in future budgets as well

3122257 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3122258 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3122259 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3122260 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3122261 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3122262 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3122263 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3122264 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3122265 i think also that black people would say that he dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
3122266 im saying thats what i think that they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason that he is in is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian but i think him and mccain are the two best choices in my opinion that weve had in years
3122267 i voted for george w bush twice looking back on it they both made a lot of mistakes but at the same time with the people they were running against i didnt feel like i had a choice
3122268 we were just literally looking at each other and we said what should we play being a session musician i didnt know anything at all there was an old yardbirds number called train kept a rolling and jimmy yelled out its easy just g to a and away you go
3122269 i could feel that something was happening within myself and to everyone else in the room it felt like wed found something that we had to really be careful of because we might lose it the power of it was remarkable
3122270 i had it in my mind exactly what i wanted to try and get together
3122271 the whole room just exploded there were lots of silly grins and oh yeah man this is it man yeah it was pretty bloody obvious that it was going to work from the first number
3122272 at the end of it we knew that it was really happening really electrifying exciting is the word we went from there to start rehearsals for the album
3122273 i didnt want to be lumped in with those people i wanted to be associated with someting more classic
3122274 we played it and didnt think it was quite right i called bowie and said thanks very much for the tape we wont be needing it because weve split up
3122275 bowie said also ive written a song for you since we spoke which could be great
3122276 bowie played me this song all the young dudes on his acoustic guitar he hadnt got all the words but the song just blew me away especially when he hit the chorus
3122277 we couldnt believe it in a office at regent street hes bowie strumming it on his guitar and im thinking he wants to gave us that he must be crazy we broke our necks to say yes you couldnt fail to see it was a great song
3122278 it was a high because we knew we were singing a hit

3122294 we do not anticipate a meaningful improvement in our markets in the near term
3122295 this is an act of desperation what youre seeing today

3122326 the message is that being overweight is much more unhealthy for some people than others
3122327 we dont yet know what the longer term risks are of excess fat in the liver but we assume that it may then lead to scarring and what we are now talking about is nonalcoholic liver disease
3122328 its an area of tremendous concern particularly as younger people are becoming heavier and heavier and appear to be getting some of these fatty infiltrations in the liver
3122329 just because you are lean it doesnt mean you dont have cardiometabolic risk
3122330 weve tended to think that weight is a proxy for health but it may be more complicated than that if you are obese there are still things you can do to be healthy and we need to think about where you stand on the cardiometabolic risk continuum
3122331 all physicians would recommend for a number of reasons that overweight patients should lose weight theres cardiovascular disease risk theres cancer risk which wasnt addressed in these studies
3122332 the physical activity story just look at the scale look at your whole lifestyle

3122339 it is early in the process to know the kind of damage so we dont really know a dollar figure
3122340 theres also the question of how much of the damage was insured apparently there are quite a few renters in the neighbourhood and many of them did not have tenants insurance
3122341 for as long as you cant operate and youre not making the money that you would normally make theres insurance coverage for that
3122342 its too late after the event to adjust your coverage to cover that sort of thing but the main thing is to get the claim in and hear what your personal situation is from your insurance company
3122343 in the meantime youve got to look after yourself as if you were not insured and youve got to make sure that any damages are mitigated by any actions you can take

3122346 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3122347 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3122348 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3122349 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3122350 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3122366 youre dealing with raw truth and believe it or not country and western and soul music are first cousins because its the voice of the common folk
3122367 when i first performed phoenix i was at a predominantly black club and i knew they didnt want to hear any glen campbell
3122368 i had to bring it to a level they could understand the club was packed and everybody was talking no one was listening so i tell the band the mar keys to hang on to this chord and i started doing this rap over it about what happened to the couple in the song that led to their breakup pretty soon the club is silent and people are listening to every word by the end of the song some of them are crying
3122369 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3122378 the infrastructure was pretty much a hodge podge of different disparate pieces and systems that had been cobbled together by a couple of previous is directors so basically it was a swamp
3122379 i was looking for a monitoring surveillance tool that would allow me to identify detect and troubleshoot problems long before the phones started ringing or the executives beat me up in the hallways because the network was down
3122380 i had tremendous success with groundwork while working for another company
3122381 because of the fact it was open source it was far cheaper the company itself was a great implementer and the tool was geared towards the type of monitoring surveillance that i needed in my business thats ultimately why i selected it a lot of it was price driven but there was a lot of functionality decisions that i made based on groundwork groundwork requires far far less support than most of the other primary proprietary software vendors
3122382 at the end of the day it allowed me to get out of the 80 availability circus that was going on here
3122383 were at four 9s now 99 99 and have been four 9s over the last three years the second benefit was with care and feeding some of the major proprietary software packages that ive rolled out have required a one or two headcount on a dedicated basis right now we think managing the groundwork solution is about one third of one persons time per year another of the more compelling benefits that we were able to derive was people remain far more productive because there was far less downtime with the systems
3122384 businesses are doing a lot of intelligent things with open source solutions by wrapping other software packages around them and making them solutions instead of just software packages id encourage my peers to be more comfortable with open source solutions

3122404 having a wall definitely has a bad influence on business

3122545 because that young boy would never have done this never thought about doing it
3122546 my first reaction was of all the people not john edwards
3122547 edwards just fell into a trap that we can all fall into
3122548 i would treat him no differently but he would be snubbed by some people
3122549 to be involved in something like this my heart goes out to his wife
3122550 there should not be any cdc that does not see itself as a developer of rooftops
3122551 the beauty of the whole concept of community development corporations is that they are community based and that they are positioned to respond to find resources and direct programs in response to the communitys needs
3122552 that is a holistic approach to revitalizing neighborhoods its not just about the houses its about the people
3122553 we want to give them the support that they need to be successful and we want to maximize our investment

3122571 importante tener un seguimiento en el trabajo en la convocatoria en la selecci n el objetivo es trabajar el d a de hoy hacerlo lo mejor que se pueda y esperar creo que deben estar los mejores en la selecci n
3122572 es poco tiempo para trabajar ya trabajamos tres d as la semana pasada ahorita son s lo dos d as es poco tiempo para el partido ante honduras hay que tratar de hacer lo mejor en estos pocos d as que quedan tratar de hacer y asimilar el trabajo que quiere el entrenador para que se vea un equipo competitivo contra honduras hay que trabajar con intensidad como los tres d as de la semana pasada se trabaj con mucha intensidad eso fue lo bueno se vio el grupo bastante competitivo entre nosotros
3122573 todos queremos estar en la lista final hay que buscar dar lo mejor en cada entrenamiento como habl la semana pasada si estoy para jugar contra honduras voy a estar muy feliz sino a apoyar desde afuera
3122574 uno sue a uno quisiera estar ah pero hay que tratar de ganarse ese lugar a base de trabajo
3122575 ellos ser n la base ellos van a llegar al partido nosotros ac tenemos que ganarnos un lugar para tambi n estar ser a una motivaci n estar ah el poder a jugar al lado de ellos el poder volver a formar un buen grupo
3122576 venimos con la idea de trabajar y ganarnos un lugar es un sue o m s que se me ha cumplido

3122581 i only regretted that i shot short in the critical time well leave the keep up for the next four years
3122582 as far as the first concerned this is the gold medal challenge against the team we knew very strong indeed the last one thats because i am aware that there was a possibility of winning the gold so i got nervous its nervousness that put me in stroke both times
3122583 we did a good job today a lot of koreans came to cheer for us they really help
3122584 i think any archer here can shoot ten ten ten so you need to keep consistency and accuracy we somewhat slowed down towards the end they italian really pushed us to the end happily we laughed to the end
3122585 of course were under pressure its very tense but its part of the games in south korea in our practice we set our practising venues as close as the actual venues
3122586 we took the actual setting as the game we practised a lot in simulating the real competitions so we all can shoot eight nine and ten you dont need to practise for the very last shooting
3122587 we do know we can shoot nine and ten anytime my teammates can do it also
3122588 anyway winning the silver medal is a great achievement for us when we came here we knew that we could do well im happy we live up to expectation
3122589 i think we did well and we feel a little bit disappointed with my performance nevertheless were happy we won the silver
3122590 im kind of exciting to compete in my country a lot of people cheered for us so we fought hard without thinking much
3122591 though the bronze is a regret for us but we accept it with pleasure
3122592 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
3122593 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3122594 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3122595 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3122596 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3122597 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
3122598 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3122599 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3122600 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
3122601 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3122602 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
3122603 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again

3122619 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
3122620 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
3122621 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
3122622 he is not a guy who wants to be chummy chummy with political leaders of the party he doesnt like that sort of constraint hes an independent
3122623 so he somehow managed to become the nominee of the republican party but we all know its not because he was somebody that was kissing up to the republican establishment to say the least

3122649 even your typical back to the lander doesnt want to take one of those buildings on and most of the people to whom i do manage to sell metal topped homes tell me they plan to replace the roof as soon as they get the money together
3122650 if my friend is right and if my area is typical it seems that buying a home topped with tin might be one way to save a good bit of money and such a move could make it possible for a would be ruralite to settle in the country that much sooner

3122726 i also like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join a short while later a representative from spurs arrived to discuss my personal terms and contract
3122727 the discussion didnt take long and we agreed on everything quickly only then did my asking price go up
3122728 tottenham have a decent squad with luka modric dimitar berbatov and other players and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the champions league
3122729 the main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the english premier league and play against the likes of manchester united chelsea and arsenal on a regular basis rather than once every five years
3122730 i am sure tottenham will be back to make another more suitable offer for arshavins transfer
3122731 there is no set time period or deadline for this zenit are doing everything in the correct way
3122732 if tottenham can sell robbie keane to liverpool for 20m then they should pay good money for arshavin
3122733 antivirus engines have complementary detection capabilities and a combination of many different engines can improve the overall identification of malicious and unwanted software
3122734 this model enables identification of malicious and unwanted software by multiple heterogeneous detection engines in parallel a technique we term n version protection
3122735 joanne woodward and his daughters are beside themselves with grief
3122736 its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on
3122737 you should have huge battles that are in space and
3122738 the more we can mobilise this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
3122739 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next us administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
3122740 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
3122741 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward
3122742 for example an insurance adjuster can access claim details while on the road when previously this data resided in a terminal based application
3122743 were bringing forward a concerted effort to heighten the focus on the mobility capability that exists at ibm today to let customers access data and applications from the growing number of mobile devices
3122744 its not as bad as we thought when he came off in the first game in mallorca

3122746 its a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now
3122747 the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus
3122748 in todays economy fiscal prudence and responsibility call for tax reduction even if it temporarily enlarges the federal deficit reducing taxes is the best way open to us to increase revenues
3122749 its a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now
3122750 the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus
3122751 in todays economy fiscal prudence and responsibility call for tax reduction even if it temporarily enlarges the federal deficit reducing taxes is the best way open to us to increase revenues
3122752 in a cooling device besides temperature change you also need to know how much heat it can absorb from places you need to cool
3122753 in a ceramic atoms are more rigid so its harder to move them
3122754 atoms can be moved in polymers much more easily using an electric field so the electrocaloric effect in polymer is much better than ceramics
3122755 the fact that theyve been able to develop a polymer type material that can be used in a relatively thin film is worth a second look
3122756 also its working in a temperature range that is of interest to us
3122757 ideally you want it to work at voltages common within the realm of a notebook in the tens of volts or less
3122758 the main sticking point in terms of the technology is that we have thin films and you cant cool very much with a thin film
3122759 s f r du chefen att g ra som du vill

3122761 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3122762 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3122763 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3122764 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3122765 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3122766 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3122767 i dont think this is an encouragement to engage in any illegal action

3122784 we received a new community charter in 2003 allowing us to serve all of niagara county so it makes sense to open a branch in north tonawanda one of the largest population centers in this region
3122785 by concealing your desires you may trick people into being cruel about the wrong thing

3122788 what happens ultimately in decisions is that the traitors identity is made aware to the justice league which puts them at odds with the titans
3122789 of course if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3122790 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature
3122791 it is quite a complex matter and we cant just make a judgement on the spot but clearly we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence
3122792 however it is an evolving situation and we will look at it
3122793 as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3122794 thaksin will be making no statements in london while the judicial process remains active and he is not going to get involved in conversations about manchester city
3122795 what has happened to me and my family and my close relations has resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3122796 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3122797 i remained cool and focused there was no pressure on me i wasnt thinking about anything else i approached the final aggressively
3122798 i started off badly but then you cant let these shots take over you maybe it made me more determined
3122799 i cant describe the feeling i know how hard i have worked for this its been really tough i am completely exhausted mentally
3122800 for since the world began no ear has heard and no eye has seen a god like you who works for those who wait for him
3122801 if things go right we can start talking about forever
3122802 i expect that most of the people who participate in this project will continue to stay proprietary free after the week is over because they will discover what we already know linux foss and the freedom to choose in our digital pursuits far outweigh the digital hegemony provided by the digital mandarins in redmond and cupertino
3122803 the lindependence events are a good thing since they help overcome one of microsofts biggest advantages inertia
3122804 if not for the event people would just continue using microsoft products because thats what they have always been using and they would be afraid to try something new on their own
3122805 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
3122806 well work to unlock the desktop to save our customers money and give freedom of choice by offering this industry leading solution
3122807 great but can i get one without lotus notes too
3122808 to paraphrase yoda notes leads to anger anger leads to notes consultants notes consultants lead to suffering
3122809 2008 will be known as the year of lotus notes on the desktop
3122810 this is a perfect example on why ibm stays ahead they adapt
3122811 they went from proprietary to open from dos to linux from punch cards to computers despite how old ibm seems they always seem to adapt something that some tech companies refuse to do
3122812 one of the weak points of linux desktops over the years has been access to viable let alone powerful productivity applications
3122813 ibms lotus suite has been around for years is used by billions worldwide and is well understood and well established
3122814 for red hat novell and canonical being able to leverage lotus on desktop pcs is a real opportunity
3122815 if a company is thinking of moving to a new platform this mixture of ibm and these partners gives it some options for having a solid business productivity experience with linux that would not necessitate the purchase of either vista or new hardware to support it

3122832 the genesis of those numbers is that we have a lot of domestic american resources that were not developing

3122953 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3122954 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3122955 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3122956 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3122957 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3122958 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3122959 we are not staying home with our children by default
3122960 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3122961 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3122962 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3122963 but i dont think it would pan out in the end

3122970 in hindsight guys are going to look back and wish they hadn t have done that
3122971 the problem is when prices go up they miss an opportunity to participate in that and when prices go down they ve protected themselves and that s the point in the hedge

3122976 if taiwans new government really seeks peaceful development in cross strait relations and creates the right atmosphere it should not provoke the other side
3122977 the triumph of the west of the western idea is evident first of all in the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to western liberalism
3122978 young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas
3122979 as a propaganda position they have put it out that we had a crackdown in 1989 and we saved the party and we saved the country
3122980 we didnt have a failure of will like the russians without that we wouldnt have been a great modern power
3122981 my attitude is that if you have relations with mr bashir sudanese president omar hassan al bashir think about helping to solve the humanitarian crisis in darfur
3122982 coming here is a sign of respect for the chinese people
3122983 i am sorry joey cheek did not come he is a good man

3122996 the discussion between the two parties were frank and positive they discussed the progress made by iraq and especially that of the iraqi governments success in security and the future reconstruction projects
3122997 it was scary but we needed a new level of sophistication to serve larger customers in order to grow
3122998 its tough to make all the investment on the front end
3122999 but when you need to grow sometimes you cant do it piecemeal

3123017 when we started firewire due to the complexity of our technology no one was willing or able to build the surfboards for us as a result we had to invest in our own factories and after two years we have an amazing vertical supply chain
3123018 we recently decided to leverage that platform in a very disciplined manner and thought about which brand would best fit with our technology and shared our view of where the surfboard market was headed
3123019 when i first saw nev in europe a few years back with boards built in the future shapes technology fst i knew it was something i wanted to get my hands on
3123020 firewire was formed a year or so later and brought the tech to the usa the first thing i did was send an email ordering 300 they shut me down at the time so of course we began to berate tease harass and generally poke fun at them but im stoked theyre now able to come through i feel strongly that the fst future shapes tech is a product that has viability and demand in the market combined with our user friendly as well as competition level shapes and designs it gives lost a performance proven technology that we can offer to our best customers as well as our team
3123021 but back then we could barely even build our own boards never mind making them for anyone else obviously that is not the case today
3123022 i realize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but we believe we have the best technology in the world and that gives us a competitive edge this collaboration gives firewire technology the added credibility of an endorsement from one of the premier surfboard brands in the world and cements lost surfboards reputation for leadership

3123048 if you put a tax cap on all school districts that does not lower property taxes

3123096 i have too many children to get into the endowment for phoenix families other people have found me eligible but no one has a place open

3123195 every year we get students on the line who have missed their grades but who we can accept anyway or offer an alternative
3123196 when someone is in tears but you calm them down and sort something out its really satisfying
3123197 clearings a bit like shopping but students should consider who they phone and research courses properly before calling they may be relieved to be offered anything but they must make sure its the right place and course for them
3123198 dont just start ringing people look at websites first you must have some idea of where you want to go geographically and what you want to do in most areas there will be really valid courses even if theyre not ones that immediately spring to mind maybe youre set on doing media studies but what about multimedia film or photography
3123199 i think it helps involving students in answering the clearing lines because were not fulltime university staff so were not blinkered by financial issues or having to find people to fill specific courses i dont want to get a student into a course for the sake of it

3123213 i was traveling throughout north and south america and used the service to back up copies of documents in case of emergency
3123214 we know there was definitely a lot of customer problems and when we looked at some individual accounts some people didnt have any files and some people had all their files
3123215 mediamaxs intent was to migrate users and files from the mediamax application and old streamload mediamax storage system into the new tlu the linkup application and the new nirvanix storage delivery network
3123216 however as documented on the tlu blog on their impending closure this migration was only partly possible and only a portion of the files were transferred
3123217 it was not possible to satisfactorily complete the move of files from mediamax to the linkup as we had expected and as a result cannot offer a service that meets your expectations and our business requirements
3123218 this is a very disappointing outcome for us and we know it has been a frustrating experience for many of our customers
3123219 we were paying them a pretty significant amount of money to manage the servers and storage
3123220 i think its a horrible outcome its a worst case scenario for really everybody involved
3123221 the mediamax application and database front end which nirvanix has no access to ownership of the mediamax application front end and user data belongs solely to mediamax inc
3123222 over the last year or so there were a number of problems that contributed to not being able to successfully migrate data to the linkup
3123223 system administrator ran a script that misidentified active account data and disassociated physical files from their owners
3123224 this led to files being marked offline in the old streamload mediamax file system when they shouldnt have been
3123225 this means that all files and pointers to those files are replicated within the system
3123226 furthermore a series checks and balances has been installed natively within the nirvanix framework if a customer deletes a reference to a file the system logs the removal of the reference and leaves the physical file associated intact after three days the pointer to the physical file is logged with a time stamp and the pointer to that file is removed finally after eight days of the original removal of the customers reference the file is deleted off of nirvanix storage at any point during this eight day process the file can be fully recovered

3123242 i cant get into the exact financial specifics rim was quite insistent that we not release financial details
3123243 but the increase in guidance is due to rim and to other licences that weve recently signed
3123244 the companys revenues result from the licensing of intellectual property which by its very nature is directly affected by the timing of the closure of licence agreements the nature and extent of specific licences including actual rates product sales by licencees which can be subject to seasonality as well as overall market demands and the timeliness of the receipt of licencee royalty reports
3123245 in addition certain revenues may be of a one time nature thus quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenue are normal and should be expected management believes that the strength of its business should be measured by annual revenues and growth in estimated revenue backlog

3123312 great britain sort of controlled the middle 1 000 meters and obviously we have to go back and try to find a way to contain them there
3123313 it wasnt an easy race but i felt like at the 1 000 meter mark it had the potential to be under control
3123314 but its the olympics and nobody mellows out at the 1 000 even if they are up on the pack it was definitely a push all the way to the finish as everybody wants that top seed

3123319 a trip to the shops two streets away usually takes me ten minutes with a dog without one it will take me twice as long
3123320 that when a guide dog approaches retirement age owners have to apply for a replacement and their suitability to have a dog is reassessed
3123321 factors such as walking pace balance and ability to care for the dog are all taken into account to ensure a guide dog is still a suitable and safe means of mobility aid for a client
3123322 in the case of eric gamsby the charity was unable to accept eric for a replacement guide dog straight away due to concerns regarding his capability and potential safety to be a guide dog owner

3123345 recent construction crane related accidents in the new york city area have raised understandable concerns about the safety of building sites
3123346 with stricter criminal and civil penalties this new law will send a message that we have zero tolerance for any actions that negatively interfere with the inspection and licensing of construction cranes
3123347 our primary concern is the safety and welfare of our pet owners and heir pets

3123354 now a kid gets 15 20 porn emails every time they open their hotmail account its like how did they know i have an insatiable appetite for porn
3123355 and all the fucking animal porn you know what i dont think animals are putting this shit on the net
3123356 i dont think a fucking horse would stoop so low and even if horses did put porn on the net you know they wouldnt put themselves fucking a girl that would be like a human fucking a bird horses would put themselves fucking elephants or rhinos or giraffes fuck humans
3123357 i think there should be a separate internet for all you people who are actually into animal porn so then all those animal porn buffs wouldnt have to be repulsed by all the sick human porn

3123362 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3123363 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3123364 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3123365 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3123366 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3123367 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3123368 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3123369 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3123370 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3123371 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3123372 its basically a platform for exposure and opportunity to get feedback and learn about the craft
3123373 hopefully well be able to find something that will make it on the page into a printed book and ultimately into a movie and on the screen

3123430 no theological grounds for condemning or prohibiting marriage between consenting adults merely because of racial origin
3123431 laws which prohibit inhibit or hamper marriage or cohabitation between persons because of different races religions or national origins should be nullified or repealed

3123433 under the facts presented the appellant does not have the benefit of assailing the validity of the statute
3123434 there was a 448 per cent increase in the number of interracial marriages
3123435 if the only arguments against same sex marriage are sectarian then opposing the legalization of same sex marriage is invidious in a fashion no different from supporting anti miscegenation laws

3123448 in this new years honors list actor ian mckellen was honored for his work on behalf of homosexuals a century ago oscar wilde was locked up and put in jail
3123449 from the pulpit homophobia is preached by some arrogant religious leaders who think their beliefs are superior to our inborn and some would say god given nature
3123450 the bishop of motherwell addressed his flock and told them how appalled he was that i had received an honor and that 100 years ago i would have been imprisoned like oscar wilde he feels that the roman catholic church is beleaguered in some way
3123451 the bishop is in my view a profoundly ignorant and stupid man in his views
3123452 if he finds it offensive that gay people want to celebrate those gay people who died in the holocaust which was a large number of people then hes also profoundly unchristian
3123453 the church is shocked by how quickly attitudes have changed all churches have thrived on prejudice its a means of keeping people under their control and i think they are really shocked at how quickly the world has moved on especially as it isnt the world they would like it to be so they cite biblical incidents as being the word of god
3123454 i was certainly not saying that homosexuality is a crime which requires prison nothing of the kind
3123455 the focus was on the progress made by homosexuals rather than the suggestion that there should be any draconian laws

3123525 i was very comfortable with my game there here it wasnt the case i wasnt happy with how i was swinging the club this week
3123526 the only thing i knew from experience is that in a major nobody goes without making mistakes
3123527 as long as i hung in there i knew i would get my opportunity
3123528 and the putts there was no question i was just fully focused on holing them
3123529 its nice when youve got to hole a putt that you see the line right away
3123530 it was an easy putt to read it was a double break i hit it a cup right of the hole
3123531 i knew the pace was about right i wanted to see it break i was just saying go on keep going keep going break it broke right left and got just inside the left half and dropped very nice
3123532 i hit 6 iron from 178 yards into the wind
3123533 i came out of it just a touch and it hit in the bank and came back into the water
3123534 not at all ben was playing well i could see that he was hanging in there nicely he had a good start and he hung on tough i wasnt only focused on padraig i thought ben had a realistic chance to win
3123535 you were three shots ahead of him going into the 10th hole are you thinking then that youre going to get your first major
3123536 hold on by the way on the 10th tee i wasnt leading by three make sure you get your facts right because i was tied with ben curtis there you go
3123537 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3123538 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3123539 i think the goal at the beginning of the week every player here would have said if anybody was under par they would take it
3123540 every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play in a championship like this
3123541 people in michigan are getting excited this is the best they have seen someone in a detroit lions outfit play in a long time
3123542 obviously wearing the detroit lions gear doesnt hurt they want to see someone wearing a lions hat win
3123543 of the three you said there i really do like the fact no other european has won two majors consecutively obviously i hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem to achieve something they hadnt is very special
3123544 the wind was blowing and the fairways were soft making it extra long and then the pins were very tough in the afternoon
3123545 we now have the potential to play it 7 680 yards said jim dauhalter hazeltines general chairman for the event
3123546 i doubt that pga of americas kerry haigh will use all of that yardage and hes also suggested that we not talk that much about added length that the players get irritated when thats all they hear about

3123561 at no time in the past 50 years has this happened without the economy being in an official recession
3123562 the path to financial ruin is littered with calls of a bottom and i dont think you want to confuse intermediate bottoms with fundamental bottoms i think that is quite a dangerous game to play
3123563 i think what separates my call say from the consensus is that i dont necessarily think this is going to be a mild flash in the pan i think this is going to be a long recession

3123624 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3123625 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3123626 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3123627 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3123628 its 1987 and the final countdown is on for a legendary
3123629 the genre of 80s rock was so grandiose in its theatricality that for me it only made sense to turn something like sister christian into a showtune this was lifestyle music it was just as much about the look the clothes and the parties as it was about the songs wed all like to believe we were just listening to elvis costello and the buzzcocks back then but i know my first kiss was to great whites once bitten twice shy so there you go
3123630 i would like to see the church become a safe haven for all its members
3123631 it has always been the intent of the church to engage in an open and honest discussion with affirmation leaders to listen to their concerns when the church was originally approached by affirmation church officials offered a much earlier meeting date the meeting was put on hold until august at affirmations request the church asked for the same courtesy as it hires a new director of family services a position crucial to this conversation
3123632 the issues surrounding same gender attraction deserve careful attention not public posturing
3123633 it appears from affirmations actions today that it has opted for a public rather than private exchange
3123634 if i had more money i would have stayed and never gone back
3123635 we hear from other returnees that they had regret going back because there is still bombing kidnapping and killing
3123636 god willing the flights will continue in order to fetch all families that wish to come back we welcome all our citizens who want to come home
3123637 some iraqis are choosing to return because the situation has improved in their areas but many others find themselves under many pressures in the host countries as their savings and resources have been exhausted
3123638 im concerned that i will not be able go out freely whenever and wherever i want like i used to do in egypt
3123639 i dont know how we are going to cope with our new lives it is going to be hard with no security electricity or enough drinkable water
3123640 it is of our duty to rebuild our country and to help rid it of sectarianism
3123641 look at the double standards of this government it did not help us during all the bad times in exile but when it came to its own political gains they sent a plane to get us back probably to our death
3123642 the only thing most people around here know how to do is grow sugar and play football
3123643 it will survive but no one knows what will be left of it
3123644 i think its going to have a really big effect around here
3123645 theres nothing really to do besides work for sugar companies and play football here i dont have to worry about it but them little kids coming up will
3123646 theyve given lots of financial support to all the schools over the years
3123647 id like to think were going to find someone else to support our program but there isnt anyone else out here
3123648 we know people are probably expecting a cheese fest and thats just not what we do
3123649 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3123650 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3123651 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3123652 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3123653 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3123654 i think its important to show what kids really use
3123655 things can take a turn and you can get a big head or get jaded
3123656 the next two weeks were going to be unveiling more and more ads and everybody that we talk to is saying get ready get ready
3123657 extremely disturbing statements on issues which it is clear he was very poorly informed and on which he chose to lecture the government and the people of kenya on how to manage our country
3123658 raila odingas politics like the politics of his father odinga odinga are on the far left raila odinga was educated at the technical university in magdeburg in east germany where he graduated in 1970 with a degree in mechanical engineering there he heard fidel castro lecture and he named his first born son fidel on july 31 1982 junior military men of the luo tribe in the kenyan air force led a coup against president daniel arap moi but it failed for his suspected involvement in the coup raila odinga was arrested charged with treason and incarcerated without trial for nine years he was released in february 1988 and then rearrested in september 1988 this time for involvement with the clandestine kenya revolutionary movement and for facilitating travel to libya for kenyans seeking to get military training under colonel muammar qaddafi
3123659 we have to ask whether obama by supporting odinga openly in kenya lent his name also to endorse odingas leftist politics and odingas alliance with radical muslims pushing islam in kenya
3123660 obama visited kenya while president kibaki was locked in a presidential election contest with raila odinga during his visit the kibaki administration objected that odinga was using obamas visit to win votes obamas repeated public appearances with odinga and his almost daily criticism of the kibaki government added to the kibaki administrations dismay at how the u s senator conducted himself in their country
3123661 the channel 2 news team also interviewed on camera kenyan government
3123662 i think obama has to look critically where he is receiving his
3123663 by supporting odinga senator obama is also seen in kenya as siding with the extreme left wing of kenyan politics going back to the overt communism of odinga odinga odingas current party the orange democratic movement or odm is a leftist socialist political party that stops short of being openly communist
3123664 after the december 27 2007 presidential vote raila odinga charged he had been denied the presidency by voter fraud odingas claim led to widespread fighting that killed more than a thousand people in the weeks after the election and left more than 350 000 kenyans displaced
3123665 christian missionaries reported that more than three hundred christian churches were severely damaged or destroyed in the wave of violence that swept the country but mosques were left undisturbed
3123666 another horrific report came from the telegraph in london members of president kibakis kikuyu tribe were attacked in nairobi slums by ethnic groups including luo youth and men who engaged in gang rapes of women and gang sodomy of boys as young as five years old
3123667 although odinga professes to be an anglican christian concerns even today continue to circulate especially among kenyas christian leaders that odinga intends to pursue an undeclared radical islamic political agenda
3123668 what appears documented by kenyan newspaper and television news reports is that raila odinga representing the orange democratic movement or odm and sheikh abdullah abdi the chairman of the national muslim leaders forum or namlef signed an agreement on august 29 2007
3123669 in return odinga promised that within six months of becoming president
3123670 re write the constitution of kenya to recognize sharia as the only true law sanctioned by the holy quran for muslim declared regions

3123713 i will say i dont want this to linger too much longer i should make my final decision pretty soon whatever that is i want to make sure its 100 percent sure
3123714 when i talked to francois in june we both understood that the team was going to go forward regardless of what my decision was going to be and that enabled me to take as much time as i could

3123809 sport sociology brings to bear a number of intellectual tools that allow one to look critically at power relations while connecting sport to large social issues including race class nationalism and gender
3123810 many sociologists of sport want to do more than simply make observations or apply esoteric theories they direct their work to have an impact on sport they hope to challenge and change sport and society
3123811 i use my scholarship against native american mascots and other forms of racism in sport i can point to some real impacts on public policy and have heard from some readers that my work has made a difference unfortunately like much academic work it has reached a very small set of readers mostly other scholars and students

3123826 i love sienna i think shes a wonderful actress but weve been like two passing ships in the night recently
3123827 i think thats lovely but also sad about acting you get incredibly close to people and as soon as its over you dont see each other

3123831 it shows that pagans who were a minority prayed in the centre of the city and lived in harmony with the jewish majority

3123843 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3123844 wir waren ein bisschen besser jetzt dr cken wir deutschland die daumen wir leben hier das ist unsere zweite heimat das wichtigste war dass alle fair zusammen feiern
3123845 the border between music and noise is always culturally defined
3123846 theres a basic principle we have here that you always support your military
3123847 theyre literally fighting for our freedom and many lose their lives so its the least we can do
3123848 chief pyle and the people of the choctaw nation are amazing patriots

3123859 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
3123860 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
3123861 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
3123862 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint the image could then be used with fingerprint recognition software to identify an individual
3123863 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
3123864 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
3123865 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
3123866 we urge all parties to seize this opportunity to begin a frank dialogue to resolve outstanding issues and define a way forward that unites all bolivians

3123868 the composition and dynamics of north atlantic communities will change
3123869 but whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
3123870 the interesting thing to me is that the fossil record has something to say about the consequences of global warming
3123871 the experiments by our collaborators at the university of california san diego demonstrated that this mechanism is present and our theory explained why and how it happens
3123872 the gap in understanding of single bond and multiple bond breaking processes is just incredible
3123873 it became a chicken or egg problem if cooperation between t and b cells is needed to create an autoimmune disease who falls off the fence first and why shlomchik said
3123874 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
3123875 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
3123876 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
3123877 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
3123878 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
3123879 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
3123880 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
3123881 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
3123882 this is the first step in the development of an electric field refrigeration unit
3123883 for the future we can envision a flat panel refrigerator no more coils no more compressors just solid polymer with appropriate heat exchangers
3123884 these polymers are flexible and can be used for heating and cooling so there may be many different possible applications
3123885 this gene has been associated with a combination of kidney and eye disease in human patients
3123886 here we found a mutation that affects only the eyes suggesting that this gene might be a candidate for human patients with eye disease only
3123887 the new information that the nphp4 gene can be involved in eye diseases only can shed light on the etiology of some low frequency eye diseases in people where similar mutations may be involved
3123888 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3123889 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them

3123937 i loved my teammates and some people might be surprised to know this but i loved my coach at west virginia it just wasnt fulfilling enough and it was too far away from home for me i wanted to get to the end of my collegiate career and be able say it was worth all the time energy and effort its not worth it if youre going to do all of that hard work and get to the end of it and just say okay i played soccer for four years i loved the program at west virginia but i just needed to go home and im really happy that i did
3123938 when i came home i came home to work i had a job with the kansas city wizards and my high school coach matthew pritchett called me one day and said steph i dont want you to not play this year i kind of brushed it off and said if my time is up my time is up but he told me to look into ku and at least give it a shot
3123939 one thing my mom has always taught me is that god has a plan for you so anything that happens to you is not a surprise to him even if it might be a surprise to you i had actually quit the team at west virginia after my second year there so i thought i was done but then when i decided to move back to kansas and coach francis sent me that email the door was opened again
3123940 when i moved to west virginia i relied on my mom so much she was my best friend if im in trouble or having a bad day no matter what the situation i could call her and talk to her about it there is no person my age that i connect with as well as my mom there are times when i can ask for advice and then there are other times when i can say mom i dont need you to be mom right now i just need you to listen because i need somebody to talk to i dont know where i would be if i didnt have her
3123941 its hard to say my mom will be the first one to tell you that she wasnt an athlete my whole family is very smart my mom was the valedictorian of her class my father was of his class and my brother is really a smart guy and then stephanie can play sports im not quite at the genius level of the rest of my family its alright none of them can kick a ball
3123942 i think i initially got into sports just because i liked to play so much
3123943 as i got older and i got better i became a little more focused on soccer
3123944 i want to stay in sports in some way my main goal is to get a lot of different experience ive done event planning and sales and also worked with kids at different camps and with the kansas city wizards i just want to do as much as i can so that when im done i know exactly what i want to do
3123945 ive actually met quite a few sports agents too one of them was the agent for wnba players candace williams and sylvia
3123946 i like to cook i can make about anything from a recipe but im a big meat person and i like to add my own ingredients if i had a whole day to plan whatever i wanted to id probably smoke some ribs and probably have potato salad if i was trying to be healthy id cook up some greens and of course wed have to have dessert that would be a dream day for me

3123982 i think this study demonstrates that the problem of refractive eyesight errors is on the increase particularly in terms of the amount of nearsightedness in the american population
3123983 no one knows for sure what accounts for this but its a pretty smart hypothesis that the increased amount of near work that were doing as a population may be increasing the incidence of nearsightedness and it does suggest that we should be looking into ways to deal with it
3123984 i would hazard to suggest that in general the widespread prevalence of refractive issues today could be related to environmental factors like extensive use of tv and computers and among the young video games because today we get much heavier loads on our eyes from all of that and those are strenuous activities for our vision
3123985 half the u s population needs glasses of some sort so this does not strike me as unusual at all
3123986 and so even though many patients routinely come in concerned about having a surgical problem its much more often this sort of issue im a surgeon but im very happy to tell people you dont need surgery and often they dont they just need eyeglasses

3123990 consumers will accept an awful lot if you let them know what they are accepting
3123991 youre the transfer from hayama right im col abe natsumi most people call me col nacchi though well anyway youll be assigned to assist the leader of c platoon theyre a unique bunch of soldiers their barracks are right over there by those trees go introduce yourself and get comfortable
3123992 uh excuse me pvt okai where is your commanding officer at
3123993 yes maam im sergeant first class umeda erika reporting for duty
3123994 im 1st lieutenant yajima maimi you are from camp hayama right what did you do there sergeant
3123995 well maam i was in a supply unit for the past 9 years and decided to join the infantry so i could actually fight instead of carry boxes all day
3123996 those girls out there are a real fighting bunch some of them fought in the war in hokkaido a few year ago remember that mess sgt
3123997 i sure do i only helped send supplies to the frontlines though the closest i got to hokkaido was a supply depot in aomori prefecture
3123998 well anyway go put up your stuff and introduce yourself
3123999 now this lady beside me is your new platoon sergeant sgt umeda you will give her your full attention when she asks and i will not tolerate you giving her backtalk if i hear about any disrespect expect my boot in your face

3124009 see that town all the way down there thats aki
3124010 it is the only way to get there from up here on this mountain is by helicopter or by driving down a long crooked path
3124011 when i think about how little it looks from here it inspires me
3124012 anyway i think about how if aki wasnt down there then this would be a pretty lonely place makes you think about how far away from home you are so to change the subject did you read the platoon sergeants manual before you came here
3124013 you have to learn each of the specialties of the people under your command
3124014 youll learn platoon cs specialties after i wake them up real quick hold on for a second

3124026 oh youre the new platoon crappy sergeant huh im sgt tanaka part of the deadly aces squad
3124027 if youre gonna defend this idiot then youre gonna get beat just like her
3124028 you you got a hit what am i gonna do this this aint over new meat okai ill be coming back for you have my money next time
3124029 theyre a 4 member gang who are all combat vets of the hokkaido conflict they go around beating up people and stealing money and food they usually end up beating to a pulp anyone who opposes them
3124030 but you made one of them give up though which is pretty cool
3124031 the other 3 members are stronger than her and once she tells the others theyll be all over you like a dog on a porkchop
3124032 once you make one mad you have to deal with the others

3124062 ehhhh its alright it isnt as busy as hayama i remember there always a line to the bathroom even at night
3124063 well about 3 months ago mjr yaguchi one of the head officers on base thought there were enemies coming out of the toliets because she heard a strange noise coming from her personal bathroom she ordered all soldiers on base to grab a gun and defend every bathroom to the last man turns out that strange noise was just creaky pipes
3124064 but she still stuck to the story that there were enemies in the toliets
3124065 have any of you seen a girl named u ume umeda
3124066 you better tell me who you are before i beat your face in
3124067 im the ace of clubs i am officially im sgt michishige sayumi
3124068 a bunny of death whats next a poodle of pain
3124069 youre okai are you tanakas told me so much about you she has strange i thought you would be cuter
3124070 after im done with umeda here im coming for you so i wouldnt be laughing right now
3124071 this i was in south sapporo in the last year of the war a terrorist shot a racket launcher towards my position and the explosion burned my face and neck
3124072 but i still managed to be the cutest patient in the hospital how lucky for me right
3124073 whats with this cuteness stuff are you gonna fight me or not
3124074 you know i was never good with punches kicks are more my style
3124075 did you know that clubs are associated with war thats why this special move is called the kicks of war
3124076 maybe if i can somehow grab her legs i can shut her down
3124077 well ok then you were starting to get on my nerves anyway
3124078 im so so sorry for all the trouble i caused
3124079 yeah im ok she just got a lucky shot thats all
3124080 yeah shes probably just knocked out lets get out of here
3124081 hey you guys whos gonna pay for all this stuff
3124082 aww man i guess do ill do it later this week
3124083 normally i wouldnt allow food in the barracks but youre lucky i like yakiniku and the fact that youre kind of cute well i fulfilled my yuri moment of the day hahaha
3124084 anyway when we get inside give me a piece of that stuff will you
3124085 did you leave a egg salad sandwich in there again chisa
3124086 that only happened once little kid and i just forgot to throw it away thats all
3124087 umeda read as the rest of the platoon crowded around her
3124088 and this girl sounds pretty weirder than my grandmas chickens after i put hot sauce in their food
3124089 lets just hope that shes defeated quickly like last time
3124090 hey airi chan is this you guys new sergeant i havent properly met her yet
3124091 im staff sergeant tsugunaga momoko sergeant of platoon b you can call me momo or tsugu chan or whatever you feel like new friend
3124092 was that you who beat up sgt michishige in that bar a few days ago
3124093 i watched you two fight congrats on beating her by the way if i remember the order correctly you have to fight kamei next right
3124094 yep using lovey dovey stuff and adding random lyrics from love songs just like always
3124095 cute girl but a little on the crazy side anyway it seems she neglected to tell you about the lucky 30
3124096 the lucky 30 whats that sounds like a reality show
3124097 no its not a reality show but it does sound like one doesnt it anyway theyre 30 soldiers that kamei san pays to protect her
3124098 the leader is a very cute girl named cpl mano youll usually find her by kameis side
3124099 yeah shes really powerful she might look small but i heard she took on 5 people at once and won thats probably why kamei hired her
3124100 or maybe she hired her because they were best friends i forget why sometimes
3124101 wait i got a idea what if i train all of you to fight with me
3124102 and ill check with my captain and see if platoon b can help you
3124103 wait why are you gonna try to help us momo the aces havent attacked you have they
3124104 but they attacked some of my friends and i hate seeing my friends sad so i want to stop them from hurting any more people
3124105 want me to go with you to talk to your captain
3124106 and bring that bag of yakiniku the captain loves food
3124107 come on open the door or ill kick it open
3124108 well im sfc umeda erika maam me and platoon c are about to fight the ace of hearts and need some help with the lucky 30
3124109 so let me guess you want b to help you fight the 30 right
3124110 give me some of that food and ill help you
3124111 this smells good alright meet me at the gym tomorrow afternoon and well train together thanks for the snack
3124112 so what are we gonna be doing pushups or situps
3124113 were gonna run around the camp 4 times thats about 2 miles
3124114 wait first of all two miles were not training for the olympics lady
3124115 im cpl natsuyaki miyabi main rifleman of platoon b punk
3124116 and were gonna run 2 miles to build up our endurance got that
3124117 but you better not make me mad punk i didnt wake up at 6am to deal with people like you i came to train
3124118 then were gonna practice some different fighting styles after that i think captain might tell us more about the lucky 30
3124119 team it looks like we have a full day ahead of us so lets get this all done and then ill go get us some pizza
3124120 i cant think run and food at the same time
3124121 ok for those of you who dont know this is pfc tokunaga chinami and we are gonna teach you different fighting styles
3124122 wait tokunaga you mean the same tokunaga who won the yokosuka fighting tournament a few years back
3124123 youre ume chan from camp hayama i never thought i see you again
3124124 oh yeah sorry tokunaga and i fought in the yokosuka fighting tournament about 3 years ago she won 1st and i won 2nd
3124125 yeah after that we went back to our separate bases and lost contact because someone didnt tell me that they changed their number
3124126 it was an accident i just forgot to call and tell you
3124127 yeah sure anyway im gonna teach you guys the art of karate which is my fighting style first you get into the fighting stance like this make sure it isnt showy
3124128 then you punch like huu and then like haa ok then you try
3124129 these moves can break arms and legs if you use them right
3124130 hey umeda why dont you show them your fighting style miss 2nd place fighter
3124131 why dont we go eat something my stomachs killing me
3124132 i cant wait to eat i cant remember the last time i ate
3124133 so captain why dont you tell us more about the lucky 30
3124134 im sure that momo told you that cpl mano leads the 30 right
3124135 ok then that saves breath anyway the 30 is divided into 3 groups
3124136 10 use stealth attacks 10 use assault attacks and 10 use swords
3124137 trust me ive seen these guys they are not by any means normal the last person to fight them was never heard from again
3124138 me too but hopefully beating these guys will be perfect revenge for her
3124139 pvt ishimura thought she could take on kamei mano and the lucky 30 at the same time she never got close to kamei because the lucky 30 attacked her first she bravely fought them beating at least 10 of them but the other 20 overwhelmed her and she disappeared
3124140 we dont know what they did to her after that but considering that the 30 are pretty psycho we assumed the worst
3124141 they usually hear about everything that goes on around here
3124142 the 30 operate secretly by day theyre normal soldiers and by night theyre basically assassins
3124143 you could say that but theyre more like new age ninjas
3124144 well need some more training before we take them on
3124145 but if all goes right we can beat them on our first try
3124146 i just wanna get them and the aces out of here by the way how do you know so much about these guys anyway captain
3124147 after ishimura disappeared i tried to get all of the info i could about the 30
3124148 luckily there was an ex 30 member here in town who knew about them he said that they find the craziest people on base when they need positions filled but talking about those guys is making me hungry is the food coming
3124149 lets make it quick though these sweaty socks are killing me
3124150 i can feel the tension in the air but this is a family show so stop fighting or ill hit you
3124151 oh yeah this is a picture of a policeman after my grandma got finshed with him
3124152 we can get in there beat em up and get out
3124153 they probably expect us to come during to the day
3124154 wait a second shimizu dont we have to go to the officers party tonight
3124155 dont worry ill just say we both have a cold
3124156 if we can beat them we might find out what happened to ishimura
3124157 hold on ms yokosuka fighting champion we cant just run into a battle like that
3124158 we dont know what they planned for us out there someone throw a can or something out there
3124159 we are the assault team of the lucky 30 and weve been expecting you guys now prepare to die
3124160 there are supposed to be 30 people here where are the other 20 guys
3124161 you know i wouldnt be making empty threats if i was in your situation
3124162 yeah i would be begging for forgiveness like a boyfriend that got caught cheating
3124163 i just turned on a bomb in the old locker rooms the hostage in there will be dead in 5 minutes try to get her if you dare
3124164 they didnt feed me and they tried to make me into one of them
3124165 now that your bomb has failed what are you gonna do
3124166 well did he tell anything important while we were gone
3124167 yeah he said the rest of the 30 are about to set this whole base on fire
3124168 hello police someones about to set the whole camp on fire
3124169 and its putting out the fires how lucky are we
3124170 now that those fires are going out lets go find the rest of the 30

3124194 in this case we sought amicus briefing from the superintendent of public instruction and the department of education in their letter brief they expressed their opinion that it is legally permissible for parents to qualify as a private school and teach their children in their own home both the governor and attorney general agree with this interpretation as does the los angeles unified school district lausd while the interpretation of the private school exemption is ultimately an issue for the courts we find it significant that education and enforcement officials at both the state and local levels agree that home schools may constitute private schools

3124230 the fbis disclosure that its agents secretly sought and obtained the phone records of american newspaper reporters confirms once again that there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools
3124231 there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency
3124232 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information
3124233 these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse

3124280 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3124281 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together
3124282 of course the situation is far better than it was
3124283 this is the only way we can show people that theres no reason to go back to the mehdi army

3124287 there was a widely held perception that the show would fail without ted koppel
3124288 very few people thought the show would survive and even fewer thought it would thrive

3124290 my hope is that we are going to see nightline enter a new golden era

3124302 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3124303 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3124304 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

3124306 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3124307 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3124308 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3124309 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3124353 thirty six percent of respondents overall said it is very likely or somewhat likely that federal officials either participated in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon or took no action to stop them because they wanted the united states to go to war in the middle east
3124354 68 percent of all germans felt the media had not reported the full truth behind the attacks

3124372 researchers are replacement for alternator didnt know where to put this so decided news
3124373 researchers are competing to meet a challenge from the u s department of energy improve fuel economy 10 percent by converting wasted exhaust heat into energy that can help power the vehicle
3124374 the doe which is partially funding the auto industry research helped develop a thermoelectric generator for a heavy duty diesel truck and tested it for the equivalent of 550 000 miles about 12 years ago john fairbanks the departments thermoelectrics technology development manager said the success of that generator justified the competitive search in 2004 for a device that could augment or replace a vehicles alternator three teams were selected to participate in the program with gm and thermoelectrics manufacturer bsst separately working on cars and a team from michigan state university focusing on heavy duty trucks
3124375 the technology is similar to what nasa uses to power deep space probes a perk being it doesnt seem to be susceptible to wear probes have used a thermoelectric setup for about 30 years thermoelectric devices can work in two ways using electricity to provide heating or cooling or using temperature differences to create electricity
3124376 the thermoelectric generator works when one side of its metallic material is heated and excited electrons move to the cold side the movement creates a current which electrodes collect and convert to electricity
3124377 fairbanks said thermoelectric generators should be on the verge of production in about three years
3124378 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3124379 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3124380 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3124381 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3124382 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3124383 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3124384 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3124385 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3124386 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3124387 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3124388 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3124389 the way to a mans heart is through his stomach
3124390 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3124391 we are proud to have published two bestselling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3124392 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3124393 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3124394 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3124395 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love

3124397 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3124398 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3124399 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3124400 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3124401 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3124402 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3124403 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3124404 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3124405 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3124406 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3124407 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3124408 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3124409 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3124410 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3124411 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3124412 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3124413 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3124414 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3124415 a convoy of vehicles was attacked by a suicide bomber i believe it hit one of the vehicles in the convoy it is an armoured vehicle
3124416 we carried out the suicide bombing in kabul against foreign forces
3124417 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3124418 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3124419 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3124420 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3124421 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3124422 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3124423 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3124424 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3124425 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3124426 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3124427 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3124428 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3124429 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3124430 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3124431 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3124432 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3124433 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3124434 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3124435 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3124436 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3124437 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3124438 well she is just going to be behind because she doesnt want to do the work
3124439 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
3124440 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3124441 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3124442 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3124443 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3124444 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3124445 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3124446 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3124447 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3124448 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3124449 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3124450 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3124451 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3124452 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3124453 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3124454 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3124455 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3124456 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3124457 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3124458 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3124459 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3124460 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3124461 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3124462 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3124463 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3124464 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3124465 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3124466 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3124467 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3124468 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3124469 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3124470 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3124471 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3124472 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3124473 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3124474 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3124475 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3124476 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3124477 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3124478 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3124479 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3124480 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3124481 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3124482 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3124483 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3124484 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3124485 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3124486 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3124487 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3124488 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3124489 the interesting thing is a cord of wood would have to cost 600 to be on par with what the price of oil is now so its still a bargain
3124490 im hoping that this will maybe not eliminate the need for oil but cut it down maybe 60 70 percent
3124491 a lot of times people would come in initially and say we want a stove just for decoration
3124492 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3124493 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3124494 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3124495 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3124496 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3124497 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3124498 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3124499 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3124500 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3124501 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3124502 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3124503 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3124504 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3124505 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3124506 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3124507 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3124508 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3124509 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3124510 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3124511 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3124512 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3124513 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3124514 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3124515 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3124516 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3124517 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3124518 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3124519 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3124520 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3124521 just so you all know we did set a record
3124522 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3124523 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3124524 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3124525 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3124526 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3124527 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3124528 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3124529 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3124530 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3124531 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3124532 you know we have that in the u s all the time
3124533 apparently its a rarity here so i dont feel any less safe here than i do in new york city
3124534 i guess hearing that news doesnt make me feel that good
3124535 its very difficult for a lot of people to get visas
3124536 its difficult for a lot of people to get access to the beautiful olympic center if you dont have tickets you just want to visit the olympic park that has the downside of spoiling some of the beauty of the olympics for some people
3124537 i think theyre scared so theyre trying to use all the resources theyve got to make people safe
3124538 so we said we go dressed in orange so they know we are not americans
3124539 the top hand in a game of poker is called a royal flush if you were to rename this top poker hand what would you call it
3124540 i like it from the bottom of my heart this way of working out is quite good you can entertain yourself while you exercise
3124541 you can just look around whenever you come when i invite people if the person thinks i dance well shell accept my invitation if she doesnt i dont care i can ask someone else
3124542 if you dance with your own people there are more problems
3124543 if you make a wrong move and your wife says youve stepped on my foot you have no other choice but to put up with it
3124544 you could dance during the cultural revolution but we didnt dance like the way we do today
3124545 they teach you how to move strategically how to hold the paddle how to move your feet theyre very warm hearted
3124546 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3124547 after all of that i thought you were going to say you murdered somebody
3124548 and we press on to win the prize pushing everything aside
3124549 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3124550 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3124551 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3124552 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3124553 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3124554 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3124555 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3124556 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3124557 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3124558 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3124559 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3124560 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3124561 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3124562 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3124563 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3124564 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3124565 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3124566 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3124567 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3124568 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3124569 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3124570 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3124571 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3124572 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3124573 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3124574 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3124575 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3124576 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3124577 during a rain delay at the delacorte theater last saturday the audience chanted hell no we wont go now the company of hair is chanting it right back i am delighted to say that the overwhelming demand for hair has led us to extend the production for another week i am thrilled that this musical has struck such a nerve with our city
3124578 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3124579 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3124580 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3124581 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3124582 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3124583 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3124584 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3124585 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3124586 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3124587 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3124588 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3124589 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3124590 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3124591 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3124592 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3124593 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3124594 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3124595 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3124596 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3124597 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3124598 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3124599 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3124600 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3124601 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3124602 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3124603 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3124604 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3124605 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3124606 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3124607 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3124608 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3124609 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3124610 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3124611 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3124612 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3124613 the prime minister was freed this afternoon along with three other government officials i understand that only the president is still being held
3124614 the six representatives firmly condemned the coup and said it was unacceptable to overthrow a democratically elected president and demanded that the president and his prime minister are set free and constitutional order is restored
3124615 there is no god except allah glory be to you surely i was from wrongdoers
3124616 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
3124617 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3124618 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3124619 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3124620 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3124621 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3124622 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3124623 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3124624 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3124625 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3124626 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3124627 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3124628 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3124629 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3124630 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3124631 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3124632 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3124633 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3124634 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3124635 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3124636 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3124637 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3124638 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3124639 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3124640 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3124641 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3124642 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3124643 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3124644 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3124645 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3124646 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3124647 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3124648 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3124649 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3124650 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3124651 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3124652 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3124653 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3124654 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3124655 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3124656 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3124657 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3124658 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3124659 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3124660 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3124661 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3124662 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3124663 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3124664 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3124665 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3124666 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3124667 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3124668 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3124669 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3124670 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3124671 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3124672 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3124673 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
3124674 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
3124675 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
3124676 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
3124677 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
3124678 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
3124679 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
3124680 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3124681 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3124682 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3124683 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3124684 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3124685 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3124686 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3124687 im juli hatten die k rntner linien auf der schiene gegen ber dem vorjahr einen zuwachs von ber 20 prozent
3124688 am beispiel der gailtalbahn ber nutzen und bedeutung der bahn und des ffentlichen verkehrs in der region
3124689 meilenstein im zuge des europ ischen fahrplanwechsels und der neukonstruierung des sterreichischen fahrplans wurde in 30 runden mit experten in abstimmung mit nah und fernverkehr der k rnten takt eingebracht
3124690 vom klimafonds gibt es f r dieses klimaschutzprojekt noch keine konkrete f rderzusage
3124691 neben der neuf rbelung der w nde der ausbesserung von mauersch den und des steinbodens im kirchenschiff wird eine neue sparsame bankheizung installiert und die lautsprecheranlage erneuert der neue hauptaltar volksaltar hat die form eines alten tisches und ist wie der ambo aus krastaler marmor
3124692 davon kommen 58 000 euro aus grund und holzverk ufen der letzten jahrzehnte der rest soll durch spenden aufgebracht werden es w re sch n wenn die leute herz und geldtasche f r unser wertvolles kulturgut ffnen w rden
3124693 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3124694 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3124695 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3124696 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3124697 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3124698 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3124699 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3124700 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3124701 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3124702 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3124703 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3124704 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3124705 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3124706 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3124707 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3124708 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3124709 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
3124710 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
3124711 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment

3124728 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3124729 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3124730 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3124733 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3124734 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3124735 tenemos liderazgos muy radicales con una cultura pol tica que no incluye el di logo y la concertaci n su estrategia es de todo o nada
3124736 hay un empate porque nadie venci sobre el otro el voto revocatorio no ha hecho m s que endurecer dos posiciones contrarias lo que sin duda conducir a un mayor grado de confrontaci n
3124737 la distribuci n geogr fica de los sufragios no modifica la situaci n de polarizaci n la fuerza de morales contin a estando en el departamento de la paz que demogr ficamente pesa mucho mientras que la oposici n mantiene su vigor en la media luna
3124738 por lo tanto el resultado del referendo se compone de una serie de apoyos y rechazos que hay que interpretar correctamente
3124739 cada vez son m s las ciudades a las que morales no puede ir por el fuerte rechazo que tiene en ellas entonces de qu sirve que diga que cuenta con apoyo popular si hay lugares a los que no puede llegar como presidente de la rep blica
3124740 me pregunto si a partir de ahora ser m s dif cil la presencia del estado en los departamentos que confirmaron a sus prefectos y no a morales
3124741 las regiones podr an decir se no es nuestro presidente no lo admitimos como autoridad nacional no negociamos con l por eso el referendo ha empeorado la situaci n en lugar de mejorarla
3124742 para que el pa s tenga cierta racionalidad se requiere que morales ceda ante las regiones opositoras y que las prefecturas enemigas del gobierno central aten en sus reclamos pero no creo que esto ocurra en el futuro cercano
3124743 no hay ninguna perspectiva de normalizaci n en un horizonte de pocos a os creo que vamos a vivir muchos conflictos durante bastante tiempo
3124744 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3124745 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3124746 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3124761 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall
3124762 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3124763 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3124764 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3124765 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3124766 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
3124767 weve adapted quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt the battle space to account for their loss

3124771 republicans stay for shadow session porter heller join protest over energy
3124772 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3124773 i think we look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3124774 while our profit this quarter is down versus last year we do feel that in the current environment this is a respectable result
3124775 conservative management of deposit rates helped us lower our cost of funds and improve our interest rate spread
3124776 while net interest income was up this was offset by our decision to increase our provision for loan losses which we felt sensible given the continued sluggish performance of the real estate market and the increase in our non performing assets
3124777 we will continue to work diligently with our loan customers currently experiencing repayment issues utilizing all available resources to resolve our non performing assets favorably
3124778 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3124779 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont

3124784 we continue to expand our product offerings and to invest in our existing products
3124785 we believe we can continue to grow through this economic downturn it would be shortsighted of us to stop development of new projects instead we remain focused on growing dealertrack by providing our customers with the solutions they need to be more efficient

3124838 the fact of the matter is ebay has created the venue ebay is profiting from the venue ebay absolutely controls the venue

3124914 stepped down monday after an internet newsletter wrote about his brief stint on the funds board which also included a fundamentalist imam
3124915 in 2000 mr asbahi briefly served on the board of allied assets advisors fund a delaware registered trust its other board members at the time included jamal said the imam at a fundamentalist controlled mosque in illinois
3124916 other web sites some pro republican and others critical of fundamentalist islam also have reported on the background of mr asbahi he is a frequent speaker before several groups in the u s that scholars have associated with the muslim brotherhood
3124917 the justice department named mr said an unindicted co conspirator in the racketeering trial last year of several alleged hamas fund raisers which ended in a mistrial he has also been identified as a leading member of the group in news reports going back to 1993

3124921 well they may be a coward but at least obamas a democrat
3124922 this continues to show that despite all statements to the contrary the job of political parties is to win elections not to change the world for the better

3124926 blame rove and fox for making that what he had to do
3124927 i prefer a winner someone who realizes that sometimes idealism is bad and you have to do things you dont like to do because its the best thing to do for the greater good
3124928 so after he sells out and gets elected then hell do wonders for the
3124929 there are only two options fight back when you must and head off stuff like this before it blows up or play the idealist and do everything you would do in a perfect world and lose thats it you keep wanting to think theres a third option but you havent been around politics at all if you really believe that
3124930 the other side can do anything it wants and gets to define our choices which are
3124931 perhaps we might consider aggressively advocating our views and defending our friends rather than running every time theyre falsely challenged
3124932 ordinary human voters respect people who stand up for what they believe in and are unapologetic about it
3124933 i want something much simpler a fighter who defends his beliefs and his friends instead of deserting them when its hard and i dont think thats too much to ask for

3125031 three years ago when aspire media acquired interweave press there was one webmaster
3125032 when we decided to make an investment in building out these hubs we felt we needed to silo e media from the rest of the organization or we would never get out of development
3125033 up to this point we have been organized exactly as we should have been
3125034 we needed to have focus to get this thing off the ground we finally reached that tipping point where we realized the segregation was becoming more of a liability than an asset
3125035 into those groups where they really are the experts in those areas and then my role
3125036 will be overall strategic planning in moving us forward working with the various entities of the organization to make them as successful at e media as possible
3125037 i think its harder to implement your web development plan in this way than with a separate web team but i think its more rewarding in the long run
3125038 a couple years ago editorial and marketing personnel handled online in addition to their print duties and online definitely got the short end of the stick
3125039 then we hired dedicated editorial for the web site as traffic and sales picked up we shifted the business team to focus online we now have a dedicated web editor multimedia team audio and video engineers for podcasts online video online streaming radio and a terrestrial radio show and new media marketing manager
3125040 despite increasingly integrated proposals were still finding the contacts vocabulary and skill set in general to be so different that specialists are needed
3125041 historically we as editors have exercised sort of god like powers over what is in our magazine
3125042 now that we can watch traffic on the web sites and survey our audiences we are having to step back and admit that we have a lot to learn
3125043 the editors understand that their evaluations will include a big component related to the traffic on the web sites they oversee
3125044 weve gotten there because editors and writers love bigger audiences
3125045 the best method is to focus the editors attention on building bigger audiences train the editors attention on the total number of people in our community and making that bigger and then show them the tools that are available to help us do that job
3125046 we are very pleased with our financial results for the quarter including the significant increase in our royalty revenues and the reduction in total costs and expenses which reflects the impact of our recent asset sales and ongoing restructuring activities as we continue to reduce our cost structure

3125048 this appears to be yet another case where a company and driver failed to get the required safety inspections and did little to protect passengers
3125049 what a lot of people dont realize is that some companies and drivers go to great lengths to get around the system so they dont have to perform safety inspections and do the other things theyre required to do to insure that passengers are safe
3125050 i think these companies should be held accountable for their actions in order to prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening again
3125051 consumers frightened of rising oil prices have turned to wood pellet heating systems in record breaking numbers this spring and summer

3125053 the secret to pelletsales coms success in holding prices stable has been our sophisticated logistics systems

3125075 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up

3125078 an optimist is a person who sees only the lights in the picture whereas a pessimist sees only the shadows an idealist however is one who sees the light and the shadows but in addition sees something else the possibility of changing the picture of making the lights prevail over the shadows
3125079 heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the trouble makers the round heads in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them but the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do

3125084 we deal in this chapter entirely with the question of how dark or how light or how medium dark or how medium light certain masses such as trees or ground or sky or mountain might be as related to the other masses
3125085 to help the beginner in determining the ratio of light and dark between these masses he should look with almost closed eyes at the landscape and the
3125086 in order to gain a thorough understanding of values it is of great benefit to the beginner to study the reproductions of fine masterpieces photographs in black and white will give better illustrations of the importance of just the dark and light design of a picture than would any amount of talking
3125087 i would rather be off on my color than off on my values
3125088 paint them in one value and tie the shapes together where you can mass those shadows
3125089 connect the lights and darks so your eye can move through the painting without interruptions
3125090 dark and light usually refers to the range of values in the entire design while light and shade generally denote the lighted and shaded parts of single items both light and dark and light and shade are active factors in composition
3125091 the primary elements of the tonal scale are dark light and the halfway shade or half tone
3125092 the lighted parts of objects are modified by the light cast upon them while the shaded parts are altered by the absence of light the halfway tone between these two shades may be called the true value of the object
3125093 light always creates values even on cloudy days out of doors there are always variations of shades in form modeling may be discerned even in moonlight or twilight in fact if there is light enough to see modeling and values are always present
3125094 values have a decided attraction of their own entirely separate from color this may often be seen in black and white photographic copies of paintings these copies many times reveal qualities that do not show in the original one reason for this is that values have a more massed appearance and the main areas are more unified another reason is the deepest dark in the painting may be much lighter than the darkest pigment yet it will show up black in the photograph therefore causing much more contrast and vitality
3125095 i am always judging how light or dark one thing is next to another
3125096 how warm or how cool how powerful the color is

3125103 im not usually one to complain but watching brock lesnar this past saturday was horrendous hes a showboater tries too hard to appeal to the crowd near the end of the fight i thought i was watching wwe and after the fight he grabbed joe rogans microphone like it was smackdown and what he had to say wasnt any better than is conduct was compare that to the class shown by gsp and fitch later on if i wanted to watch wwe and their pathetic crap i would someone needs to put lesnar in his place and i dont be beat the snot out of him though that would be nice i mean white needs to have a sit down with him because the direction this things are going is not good please lets keep ufc and mma in general a reputable sport

3125113 there is so much to admire the careful renditions of values that create layer upon layer of distance the accurately drawn and dramatic dirt road
3125114 i had her lighten them a painter needs to look for the big dark shapes first the rocks in the water were the only very dark shapes and there was no way to connect them this created unrelated holes in the composition and made the rocks come forward they should instead read in the distance the student needed to bring the foreground up by using larger shapes and more intense color the rest of the painting is very high key high key paintings are fine but the same design rules apply the same value and color theory too just in a higher value key
3125115 since the sky is your main point of interest all the other elements in the painting should support that point of view
3125116 i would downplay the landmass by painting it with very close value relationships and subtle temperature changes for the clouds the subtle shifts are in color temperature not value also the clouds will be changing in about five minutes i would paint one cloud mass at a time really focus on getting it right the first time and dont fuss with it because you have two other cloud formations you need to paint start on the left and work to the right finish as you go whenever i want to see color and temperature shifts i look at the subject quickly and look back to my palette i never stare at a shape of anything and ask what color it is glance at the object trust what you see mix it glance again adjust your paint mixture and place it on your canvas
3125117 here the sky holes in the tree on the right side of the painting are done very well
3125118 when you see sky through a tree some sky holes appear darker than others even though we know intellectually that the sky is the same color on the other side yet when the sky holes are smaller the color appears darker when you paint them this way you then start to see more volume in the painted tree theres good use of edges here too both hard and soft edges have a lot to do with how we see the world human beings can only focus on thing at a time so its important to limit the number of edges that will distract the eye
3125119 add a few more trunks in the background to help support the vegetation that is there mass the shapes and trunks underneath it you can break up that big mass later by adding various temperatures of green on the bottom right pay attention to your design that area is divided in half between vegetation and ground plane i would think about introducing more shrubs to eliminate that half and half feel
3125120 just cut off the bottom three inches of the composition and it will be stronger paint out the small hill on the bottom right its taking the viewers eye off the canvas nice value and temperature changes in the distant mountains those whites in the middle ground are the roofs of houses in the city reflecting the setting sun add warmer lights to those highlights

3125303 this will have a ripple effect through communities with hundreds of job losses loss of taxes and suppliers going out of business
3125304 bankruptcy is countercyclical it is a tool designed to be a cushion during a downturn so that everybody takes a small hit for the short term and emerges stronger for the long term

3125355 first generation solutions like firewalls and intrusion detection systems were reactive and mainly focused against threats external to the organisation
3125356 second generation solutions added patch management and react faster than first generation ones
3125357 i expect third generation solutions to also deal with internal threats be proactive provide end to end security and maximise effectiveness of existing resources
3125358 a framework of security standards policies and processes is useless without people to enforce them
3125359 with increasing threats information security governance and related regulations may become more prescriptive
3125360 but if enterprises follow them too closely without occasionally asking whether they make sense for the business security problems may still ensue
3125361 it governance is a framework and capacity for making and implementing decisions required to manage control and monitor it within the business
3125362 no single it governance model is optimal and such models must be flexible to changes in the business strategy and environment
3125363 one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
3125364 the fader guys say rcrd lbl chief executive peter rojas is talking to a big act about releasing its next album for free on his site

3125366 i had no expectations because this was my first olympics i just wanted to play my best and enjoy the atmosphere getting into the olympic quarter final is something i would have never dreamt of earlier
3125367 i was impatient and too eager to win in the first game when my score was 16 19 i knew i had a chance to win first game
3125368 the other reason im in a bad mood i just read the livejournal of someone that i dont particularly like this person is extremely hypocritical and pisses me off well i saw my name in one of the entries so i read it this person used to just get under my skin now i want to hit this person in the face so hard that it knocks them over which would have to be pretty hard then when this person is on the ground i would kick them people really just need to stop pissing me off
3125369 so hard that it knocks them over which would have to be pretty hard because shes such a fatty get it
3125370 no the worst part is definitely that that one certain person gets everything i can think of seven things this person got that i wanted just in the past six months and now this i think this has pushed me over the edge maybe itd be different if this person wasnt such a hypocrit
3125371 he was under tremendous mental stress in the final leg of the preparations and in order to have a mind without fear we enrolled him for special confidence building sessions in germany
3125372 for me life will go on as usual and 8230
3125373 he is a man of few words and that goes against him
3125374 i remained cool and focused there was no pressure on me i wasnt thinking about anything else i approached the final aggressively
3125375 for their childrens sake if for no other parents should cultivate their own lives and train themselves to live together in the most christlike way
3125376 to quote here the words of another you cannot give your child what you do not possess you can scarcely help giving your child what you do possess
3125377 i have eleven animals and so i do have a lot of days where i m like wow we really had a good day today and didn t chew on the walls and then i come home and i have a hole in the drywall so i do have a tendency to kind of relate in a way to that exasperation

3125405 initially when we were just a portal our task was to gather information on institutes that serve the physically challenged and provide it to users a matrimonial site was also included in the portal but it has now extended its scope
3125406 i realised that if people with resources had to face so many problems then what about those physically challenged who dont have much money with them
3125407 impairment doesnt just mean being handicapped from the birth we need to help those too who are very old and cannot climb stairs or someone who has broken his spectacles and cant see anything

3125409 as it is more blatant in northern india female travelers to delhi and or other areas in the north should be particularly cautious of eve teasing
3125410 should wear skirts below the knees or longer or relatively loose slacks avoiding sleeveless blouses tight pants and shorts
3125411 the americans feel that their men too invite undesirable temptation
3125412 our advice avoid revealing clothes something that really works is a set of salwar kameez and 8230 a foreign lady tourist will immediately find acceptance in the society and people will also appreciate your wearing indian clothes
3125413 travel on well lit streets and keep your purse out of sight
3125414 why is it dangerous for a white woman from west europe to come and visit delhi
3125415 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
3125416 it is unusual for an appellate court to even grant a petition for rehearing as this court did in march
3125417 but it is truly remarkable for a court to completely reverse its own earlier opinion
3125418 as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school
3125419 but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child
3125420 this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
3125421 theres a basic principle we have here that you always support your military
3125422 theyre literally fighting for our freedom and many lose their lives so its the least we can do
3125423 chief pyle and the people of the choctaw nation are amazing patriots
3125424 they have done so much throughout the course of this conflict
3125425 he truly is a person who wakes up in the morning and goes to bed at night thinking about the soldiers serving our country
3125426 its a huge honor it was overwhelming for many of our tribal members
3125427 its nice for the indian people that have fought for so many years to be recognized
3125428 they truly are doing wonderful things for military members and veterans in oklahoma and in the area

3125430 in the past some children rushed home put on their new brand name clothes and had a fashion show for their parents
3125431 a lot of them are just in glee that theyre on the same footing as their classmates before they were sort of embarrassed but this gave them new self esteem
3125432 i guess i would have to curtail the list and only 20 kids would be able to participate this would really deprive them
3125433 and thus a nation of loud and proud rednecks was born
3125434 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3125435 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3125436 todays financial news provides an independent and practical perspective on the us and global investment markets containing commentary interviews and recommendations it helps you make the right financial decisions
3125437 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
3125438 i think that sentiment is changing on china that it demand might not grow at the same rate that it has in the past couple of years and the figures from this morning attest to that
3125439 the olympic hosts seem to want to impose a binary order upon the messy continuum of gender they are searching for concreteness and certainty in a world that contains neither
3125440 are likely to produce the wrong answers because they measure maleness and femaleness by the wrong yardsticks
3125441 gender is malleable and elusive and we need to become comfortable with this fact rather than be afraid of it
3125442 choose 13 000 today and 0 at retirement or 0 today and 13 000 at retirement
3125443 no way im not risking losing 10 in four days just to get 6 now in order to risk losing 10 in four days i need a bigger payment down the road the only choice available to me is 12 so ill take it

3125447 drug control in georgia drug testing and the reduction of drug use
3125448 the former first secretary of the central committee of the communist party of georgia eduard shevardnadze initiated harsh legal measures and public campaigns against drug users in the 1970s
3125449 announced the possibility of shifting the focus of drug policy away from the predominantly law enforcement orientation
3125450 in terms of my involvement i think it would be of most use in the early stages providing advice and consultancy from behind the scenes in light of my continuing role as chair of the european monitoring group my association with the uk government and some work i am being asked to put together by the undcp united nations drug control program in vienna this fifth column role would allow me to oversee the setting up of the agency i already have good quality individuals in mind with whom i could work in confidence on this while promoting its aims subtly in the formal governmental settings

3125456 if a christian can only listen to christian music i wouldnt listen to music because most of it is bad
3125457 we have to be willing to go to places where good christians arent willing to go
3125458 we cant ignore the world we live in jesus did not ignore it dont ignore the people jesus died for
3125459 for far too long the church has gotten mad at non christians for being non christians i dont get mad at a duck for quacking its a duck it quacks
3125460 ive never found where mankind can schedule a move of god
3125461 we have to be willing to go to places that make us uncomfortable in order to reach people that no one else is reaching
3125462 the heart of jesus breaks over people that dont know him
3125463 all of this has to be looked at to make a rational decision for something thats probably going to be with us for quite a while
3125464 do we want to commit to three or four standard diesel engines belching smoke or do we want to look at something different and extend the life of the barberi and newhouse for awhile and hopefully look at new technology
3125465 its unrealistic to expect us to be able to implement a security regime like that without any effect on the operation
3125466 at some point in the afternoon we have to basically cancel a run to get the boat back on its published schedule
3125467 if you just let it go all afternoon you wont have a schedule anymore
3125468 the problem is corrected even before we could get the information out in these instances
3125469 staten islanders have to wait an hour on weekend nights and thats ridiculous
3125470 a ferry every half hour is a minimum right for staten islanders
3125471 theres no other borough where you have to wait an hour to get to the other boroughs
3125472 i favor service every 15 minutes but youve got to be realistic
3125473 ferry service is determined by passenger load not the other way around
3125474 youve really got to analyze it and see if its worth it
3125475 frankly we are tired of hearing theres not enough in the budget
3125476 its a double whammy that makes the commute to staten island much more difficult than it needs to be
3125477 the staten island ferry without question is our most important asset when it comes to transportation but clearly we need more service and more reliable service
3125478 the south shore is probably the most underserved and cut off from mass transit in all of new york city
3125479 we pay taxes like everyone else and we deserve to get our fair share of options
3125480 the subway the buses the bridges all that is subsidized by the city so why not ferry service
3125481 we should be looking at ferry service as an integral part of our mass transit system not as something separate
3125482 i am glad that wachovia is at the table with us
3125483 fridays meeting was productive and we made progress toward an agreement that will ensure investors have access to their money
3125484 investors should be able to access their money as promised and i am committed to finding a solution that will make them whole as quickly as possible

3125495 some of them criminals are taken to the jails but because they belong to the commanders they pay money and are set free
3125496 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3125497 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3125498 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them
3125499 this is like a revolt against the warlords by my family
3125500 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall
3125501 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3125502 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3125503 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3125504 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3125505 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
3125506 weve adapted quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt the battle space to account for their loss
3125507 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3125508 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3125509 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3125510 a convoy of vehicles was attacked by a suicide bomber i believe it hit one of the vehicles in the convoy it is an armoured vehicle

3125516 i was surprised that so many people knew me from my community service
3125517 i didnt have to introduce myself to a lot of new voters which has been gratifying ive been working very hard campaigning since february
3125518 my family is very well respected in black rock and i have a lot of family members still living in the neighborhood
3125519 im a black rock little league coach a member of the norden club and i expect to do very well in black rock
3125520 i was on the city council for 12 years and in that time we didnt raise taxes for 10 straight years and we also instituted six tax cuts my opponent has never done anything to help lower property taxes and has presided over a decline in economic development
3125521 she helped foster the biggest tax increase in city history and its called revaluation
3125522 its going to be hard but we need improvement in our citys schools and increased funding from the state is critical
3125523 we need to equalize the education cost sharing formula right now bridgeport receives 20 million less than hartford and thats unacceptable and we have to reel in costs at the local level when i was on the board of ed i demanded financial accountability by instituting our first financial audit that was a necessary step
3125524 as chairman of the bond commission i brought 268 million in education funding to bridgeport thats effective leadership my job is to bring money back to bridgeport and thats what i do
3125525 ive been able to build relationships with the governor the speaker the leadership
3125526 that takes time it takes time to be a member of the leadership to be a chairman of bonding because of my experience ive been able to bring more money back to bridgeport than anyone else in the citys history that type of leadership is irreplaceable
3125527 there are many examples of my opponents ineffective leadership our taxes are the highest in the state and economic development is on the decline the city is hurting right now and that is due in great deal to my opponents ineffective leadership
3125528 i have no problem with someone on the city council wanting to run for higher office but you have to have done something first and carlos silva hasnt done anything
3125529 we brought in 194 million in state funds for bridgeport this year and thats an increase of 6million from the previous year
3125530 that influx of money has a direct impact on the city and helps reduce local taxes without those funds taxes would be much higher
3125531 and they are not going to stand for the status quo their taxes are being raised and their services are being cut they were promised a 600 tax rebate by then candidate finch and instead their taxes go way up people arent going to stand for it
3125532 it seems like the race is close at the polls but the difference is my leadership my experience my independence and my ability to get things done im going to fight for bridgeport and im going to fight for property tax relief
3125533 when you grapple with property tax reform you have to make sure you promote economic development and refrain from cutting services
3125534 for instance education is critical and that has to be fully funded with my background as trumbull town treasure i know how to maximize a dollar
3125535 i think i can run well here and if im able to do that i think we can be successful overall
3125536 i think i have more personal investment with a family here in the district thats why im so concerned with health care and education these are issues that are important to my family
3125537 i care about bridgeport because ive been here for 60 years
3125538 i think we absolutely have to take care of the youngsters who are just starting out in life and the elderly who have already given us so much

3125547 millions of families are seeing their money leak out of drafty doors and windows because they live in substandard homes
3125548 with the cost of heating skyrocketing many of these families will suffer as they find it harder and harder to pay their fuel bills
3125549 if the government is serious about tackling this problem it needs to toughen regulations and introduce a concerted programme to properly insulate existing homes
3125550 what can i tell people about this how can i teach this to someone how can i make this sound powerful

3125552 i guess the batsmen did not do well and that cost us the series the middle order not getting the runs proved critical
3125553 in terms of bowling the effort of ajantha mendis was the difference it was not easy to pick runs when mendis and murali were bowling together the pressure they created made it tough
3125554 to start against two spinners is not easy and it was important for batsmen who got a start to carry on we are not offering excuses overall we did not play good quality cricket
3125555 while the middle order collectively failed to live up to its big billing vvs laxman and rahul dravid managed to salvage some pride even there though kumble did not single out sachin tendulkar and sourav ganguly for criticism
3125556 it is not sachin and sourav alone it is important for everyone to contribute the middle and lower did not contribute and that let us down
3125557 i take full responsibility and we lost a good chance here after a good win in galle
3125558 we cant lose five wickets in the first 40 overs and that has happened a few times it was a fantastic opportunity here to beat lanka and we did not capitalise
3125559 it is too early to say anything on the referral a few things have to be assessed teething problems with technology will be there for sure

3125564 that contributed thanks to their work to contemporary architectural culture showing a particular sensitivity towards environmental balance
3125565 for bsi bank investing in culture has always meant helping to raise awareness of the importance of science and the arts in our daily lives and for the sustainable development of society
3125566 thanks to the merger of banca del gottardo into bsi our commitment has now extended to architecture with the awarding of this prize the award is the culmination of two years of work by the architectural foundation which was set up by banca del gottardo and which now forms a valuable part of the heritage of the whole bsi group
3125567 this award represents an opportunity to recognise and raise the international profile of architects who can make an outstanding contribution to contemporary architectural culture it is also a good occasion to reflect critically on ideas that favour first an ethical and then an aesthetic approach the names selected can be considered as some of the most important architects working internationally today their sensitivity and professional commitment in their countries of origin highlight their diverse hopes both fanciful and realistic in contrast to the contradictions and confusion that are rife today in the debates within the field
3125568 i dont think the conflict will have big consequences at least if it doesnt escalate
3125569 the main problem for russia is that investor perception which was already low will deteriorate even further
3125570 the very fact of the conflict is not putting investors in the mood to invest in russia
3125571 the events themselves of course have an influence on the outflow of capital but they cant significantly change the fundamentals
3125572 russia is a very strong country in terms of economic development
3125573 the country is trying to enter the world trade organization and this armed conflict with georgia will make that process even more difficult
3125574 the conflict with georgia empowers the hardliners in russia economic reform in russia will be delayed
3125575 russia is an immediate neighbor you cant wish it doesnt exist
3125576 i dont think europeans will say we dont want to have to do anything with this country but europeans will think we trusted too much that russia would become more like a western country
3125577 theres no doubt that whats happening has increased the investment risk within georgia and the region
3125578 this is one more step by the russians trying to increase their power among their former satellites that raises questions over further foreign investment in georgia as well as countries like azerbaijan and ukraine
3125579 im going to spend the next two weeks in pensacola doing two a day rehab sessions i will also be working out the other parts of my body that arent hurt by swimming sprinting cycling leg training and eating 6 nutritious high protein meals a day after two weeks doc andrews will assess my progress and determine if i have to have surgery or not
3125580 regardless of the severity of my injury i will be working as hard as i can to return to the ring and continue to do what i love i have the unbelievable support of my wonderful wife family extended family within the wwe and my loyal fan base i ask for your continued support as this situation unravels i will keep you updated
3125581 they even wrote letters to the uw trying to get me fired
3125582 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
3125583 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

3125588 der g ngigen lehrmeinung zufolge war der mensch am anfang ein naturbestimmtes wesen
3125589 bis er dann irgendwann mehr und mehr zum kulturwesen wurde
3125590 uns geht es um die frage wann hat welche kulturelle leistung den menschen wohin gebracht
3125591 das weist zwar auf ein sthetisches empfinden hin war aber noch keine kunst
3125592 die kunst k nnte sozusagen als mitprodukt zu diesen technischen innovationen entstanden sein
3125593 in dieser konkurrenzsituation begannen die modernen menschen sich mit symbolen und symbolischer kommunikation abzugrenzen
3125594 die sich damals entwickelnde gesellschaft nur m glich war ber symbolische artefakte und kommunikation
3125595 ber kunst identifizieren wir uns mit der gesellschaft und der kultur in der wir leben

3125599 i think this is probably somebodys effort to get a deposit to a lawyer on an expedited basis in a case thats got a lot of scrutiny
3125600 i suspected that the shooter was a law enforcement officer and more specifically a detroit police department officer
3125601 the bowman affidavit is a little less than idiotic and more than absurd
3125602 i think this is probably somebodys effort to get a deposit to a lawyer on an expedited basis in a case thats got a lot of scrutiny
3125603 i suspected that the shooter was a law enforcement officer and more specifically a detroit police department officer
3125604 the bowman affidavit is a little less than idiotic and more than absurd
3125605 you know i think i have enough award points at work i could get one
3125606 a lot of people said this was the weaker of the two relays
3125607 the four of us set to do something that not many people thought we could do i know a lot of people on our team really stood behind us and really wanted us to do it we set the goal and we went after it and we werent afraid of the pain
3125608 who has the fastest relay times in the world this year not us
3125609 we definitely dont look at it like pressure on us
3125610 two seconds better than the prelims world record relay will not win
3125611 its unclear i didnt hear it so im not going to speculate but we know that they are a force to be reckoned with
3125612 i believe in the coaches i believe theyre going to put together the fastest relay they can if it doesnt work out for me then ive got 2012 right
3125613 they can run away from lions but cant swim away from the crocs
3125614 because the little people who live in the vent needed to butter their toast
3125615 can you imagine being a parent and not making your kids the center of your universe
3125616 you cant have it both ways the cost of things are what they cost were not designing a very expensive wall cabinet with gems because of the steel the cladding and all these are what they are costing right now so i dont see why it should spiral out of control
3125617 this is a very high profile site it is the front entry to the games we couldnt get away with any hut or tin shed here it sets the tone for all the other projects on the site
3125618 i think this is probably somebodys effort to get a deposit to a lawyer on an expedited basis in a case thats got a lot of scrutiny

3125622 when the iphone came out we were excited about the big screen the graphics chip and the good components
3125623 we thought it was an opportunity too big to pass up
3125624 we cannot speculate on the consequences for prices obviously its a positive element for europe but other elements are also important especially the state of stocks around the world
3125625 timing a prestigious sporting event gives real credibility to our brand
3125626 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders
3125627 they represent an unprecedented opportunity for all europeans to access new communication services and this not only in metropolitan areas but also in rural and less populated regions however these satellite services depend on substantial investment and therefore need simple and swift procedures as well as long term legal certainty
3125628 i expect intense competition among operators offering satellite based communication services reaching consumers from the north of sweden to the south of spain
3125629 this could pave the way for first satellite launches already in the course of 2009
3125630 youve got some people whove got money and theyre coming in and buying those premium brands
3125631 but with the financial markets down some thats off slightly and you have to expect that
3125632 it is wrong to say certain segments of the market are immune to economic downturns in the market as far as were concerned
3125633 the forecast for gdp will in all likelihood be revised lower perhaps even to show a recession in the second half of this year at the same time we expect an upward revision to the cpi inflation forecast for 2008 the peak will probably be in the region of 5 5 per cent the bank is unlikely to endorse market expectations of rate cuts over the next 12 months
3125634 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
3125635 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
3125636 most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
3125637 years of unsustainable increase in public spending have left the public finances in poor shape to cushion these adverse shocks

3125647 it may be that there are some moral prohibitions that are absolute but it is important to note that the most plausible version of this outlook holds that there are very few of them

3125670 to be able to do so with such confidence and showmanship that they won the whole competition speaks volumes about the quality of the teens who live in our communities
3125671 when they joined the council of europe georgia and russia pledged to achieve a political and non violent resolution of the conflict in south ossetia the very serious events of the past few hours represent a flagrant violation of those commitments and the risk of the conflict spreading to other parts of georgia cannot be excluded
3125672 whats the point itll be busy and youll be tired ill come see the baby in a few weeks
3125673 one of the great regrets i have about whats happened so far in my second term and happened in many ways in the first term is that when you have members of your own party and two of us get along very well and we dont agree on everything and the third for whatever reason doesnt want to talk to us its a very difficult way to govern
3125674 and again i urge you if you know speaker madigan and talk to him tell him i said hello ill cut his apple get him a cup of coffee come to the table work with us and be part of this process

3125804 a new inexpensive robotic device from researchers at carnegie mellon university attaches snugly to almost any digital camera tilting and panning it to fashion highly detailed panoramic vistas
3125805 so that as many people as possible can afford to use it
3125806 we hope it will cost in the low hundreds of dollars well below 500
3125807 as you zoom in you get progressively higher resolution images and at the deepest level is the fully detailed image that the robot shot
3125808 i find things i hadnt noticed when i was in the field
3125809 this gives you the joy of discovery not found in traditional photos
3125810 that means that when you zoom in to look at the images you are viewing them just as you would if you were looking through a pair of binoculars
3125811 you can take panoramas from video but you wont have a still image that you can stop and look at in this high detail
3125812 a low hum and the steady click of the camera

3125864 the buying or even the reading of books is an expensive hobby and beyond the reach of the average person
3125865 the annual cost of reading even if you buy books instead of borrowing them and take in a fairly large number of periodicals does not amount to more than the combined cost of smoking and drinking
3125866 to approach the mystery of our own condition we have to grasp the mystery by which words make worlds
3125867 data center building depreciation is often carried separately from data center mechanical and electrical equipment utility bills often go to a centralized energy function site operation costs for technicians security staff power and cooling equipment maintenance property taxes and other costs are often split between facilities and it budgets nowhere is the total picture consolidated
3125868 spending 2 500 on a server really means spending between 8 300 and 15 400 in facility capital to provide the necessary space for housing the server and powering it
3125869 just the electricity required to provide power and cooling will exceed the cost of the server in six years utility bills virtually never go to it and often dont go to facilities either which inhibits conservation
3125870 for an organization with 5 000 servers the industry rule of thumb is that up to 30 are technologically obsolete
3125871 if we did this on a broad national scale do we really need to be building all the new data centers or could we defer a large portion of this investment into the future our companies and economy would be far better off if that money went into new application development instead of bricks and mortar
3125872 one companys it department decided to invest 22 million in blade servers but forgot to inform facilities the facility investment required to merely plug in the blades was an unplanned 54 million an additional unplanned 30 million was required to run the blades over three years so what appeared to be a 22 million decision was really an enterprise decision of over 106 million

3125878 lets create a splintered faction that says they wont vote obama but will instead vote mccain
3125879 when mccain unfairly attacks obama over and over how about we all just remain silent

3125885 i know now that the edwards affair is public how about howard wolfson declare that if edwards had been out of the race before iowa hillary would now be our nominee
3125886 what about bob kerry making another comment about obama that helps mccain
3125887 howard i think when obama names his vp we should all argue over the choice in fact some of us should just say it downright stinks
3125888 how about we give hillary to mccain as his running mate
3125889 wonderful now for the final clincher what can it be
3125890 howard ive got it after the republican convention we officially endorse john mccain
3125891 for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun

3126418 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3126419 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3126420 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3126421 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3126422 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3126423 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3126424 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3126425 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3126426 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3126427 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3126428 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3126429 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3126430 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3126431 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3126432 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3126433 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3126434 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3126435 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3126436 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3126437 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3126438 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3126439 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3126440 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3126441 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3126442 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3126443 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3126444 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3126445 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3126446 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3126447 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3126448 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3126449 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3126450 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3126451 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3126452 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3126453 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3126454 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3126455 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3126456 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3126458 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

3126479 theres nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come
3126480 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3126481 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3126482 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3126483 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3126484 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3126485 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3126486 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3126487 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3126488 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3126489 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3126490 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3126491 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3126492 who are open to doing something on the production side
3126493 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3126494 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3126495 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3126496 the affair began before she was hired to work for the campaign
3126497 she said that he was in love with her and she was in love with him and that the relationship was solid
3126498 i had been in los angeles that day to do an event with the mayor and that afternoon i got a call in my hotel room from a gentleman named bob mcgovern and he asked me to come and meet with them
3126499 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3126500 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3126501 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3126502 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3126503 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3126504 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3126505 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3126506 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3126507 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3126508 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3126509 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3126510 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3126511 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3126512 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3126513 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3126514 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3126515 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3126516 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3126517 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3126518 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3126519 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3126520 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3126535 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this he said
3126536 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture

3126540 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3126541 the one thing that has been incredible has been the huge groundswell of support to help us pick up the pieces and help us manage this difficult situation as best as we can he said
3126542 interest has been global but in no way have we exposed ourselves with dealing with our emails and our phonecalls or anything like that its just too overwhelming we appreciate that everyone is with us we are just in no capacity to deal with that right now

3126607 theres no reason why we necessarily have to use the same three or four that are still around i mean batmans got a wide variety a rogues gallery certainly we used two in the first movie that hadnt been in the films before
3126608 characters like catwoman riddler and hugo strange make sense because theyre counterpoints to batmans psychosis and fears the joker creates chaos two face shows the duality of the batman bruce wayne relationship and how batmans found peace with that duality batman searches for answers and the riddler has questions batman is driven and catwoman is sexual they play well against each other and challenge aspects of what makes a hero
3126609 id like to see catwoman over the penguin not as a prostitute and not as the tim burton version what cats sniffed her back to life but perhaps the adam hughes design with the goggles thats very realistic i can imagine her in street clothes that are designed just right i also like the idea of them creating villains just for the movies

3126623 hey that is what a woman is supposed to be

3126625 who is this man that he goes around forgiving sins
3126626 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3126627 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
3126628 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3126629 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3126630 everything should be made as simple as possible but not one bit simpler
3126631 competition not politics should determine what goods and services cost
3126632 corporations pass on their tax burden in the form of higher prices to consumers lower wages to workers and or lower returns to investors the idea that taxing a corporation reduces taxes on say the working poor is a cruel hoax
3126633 first if youre a middle class american living beyond your means today youll definitely pay more under fairtax than you do now and that may not be a bad thing because living beyond your means is nothing to be proud of
3126634 it actually relieves taxes on some unsold warehoused mechandise removing some pressure to produce by on demand basis
3126635 so the more technology there is the less work we do but the less work we
3126636 optimistically we can be liberated for our own pursuits less occupations
3126637 designed to enjoy the presence of god but thats easier said than done
3126638 special intimacy prayer is more than prayer of the lips or of the mind it is the deep prayer of the heart
3126639 the goal of prayer should not be to bind the mind with a word or phrase in order to induce a mystical trance but rather to use the mind to glory in the grace of god
3126640 what is the goal of contemplative prayer union with god our final goal is union with god which is a pure relationship where we see nothing
3126641 i hoped to live long enough to see the day when the us is completely out of europe a lack of action or involvement by europe between georgia and russia just tells me that europe doesnt want to handle its own problems until it is entirely too late then the us will never leave europe
3126642 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself
3126643 those who would trade in their freedom for their protection deserve neither and will lose both
3126644 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
3126645 all religions arts and sciences are branches of the same tree all these aspirations are directed toward ennobling mans life lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom
3126646 the average man does not want to be free he simply wants to be safe
3126647 democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine
3126648 never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion in philosophy in politics or in anything else where i was capable of thinking for myself such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent if i could not go to heaven but with a party i would not go there at all
3126649 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
3126650 we who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others giving away their last piece of bread they may have been few in number but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
3126651 it is not length of life but depth of life

3126671 the situation is still very volatile and we estimate that many people need help and many are seeking safety elsewhere
3126672 therefore it is essential that unhcr and other humanitarian agencies are able to reach the affected and the displaced and that those who are indeed trapped in the conflict areas are granted passage to safer areas as soon as possible it is also absolutely essential that both sides respect humanitarian principles and ensure the protection and safety of civilians

3126703 de aanloop naar een nieuw seizoen verloopt altijd wat zenuwachtig maar dikwijls gaat zoiets in ons geval wel gepaard met een goeie prestatie
3126704 het is wel jammer dat we nu een week later moeten beginnen openen tegen club brugge zou mooi geweest zijn voor een jonge groep als de onze
3126705 nu beginnen we een week later met drie punten minder dat is geen voordeel

3126754 i tried alton browns recipe for x and it was disgusting
3126755 its a good situation that you can ask that question
3126756 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years it is a big step now to move up and start competing on a different level ive got phil ive got tiger ahead of me i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more what im doing
3126757 many periods in my career ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3126758 im looking at this period as one of those that i am coming out stronger with experience and im putting a lot more things together im making things happen on the golf course
3126759 its a long way to catch tiger at the top
3126760 but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me controlling what i can do thats the only thing i can ask of myself
3126761 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3126762 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3126763 i dodged a bullet because there was some more high profile losers that day
3126764 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major and youve got to lose them to know you can win them ive got to put myself in the position and learn from it and understand it before i actually go and do it
3126765 i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday
3126766 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
3126767 i have struggled ive really focused hard on the majors the last two years
3126768 my whole schedule is built around majors and definitely ive turned up at other events and unless i get into contention you know sometimes it feels like a race like a sprint whereas a major feels like a marathon
3126769 i feel like i can be patient and take my time and i love the feeling of knowing that its going to come down to the back nine its going to come down to who can do it under pressure in the last nine holes
3126770 that is an issue for me that i do have to play better when i feel confident about my game when in a normal week when i have plenty of good performances
3126771 i need the adrenaline i need to either be in contention or have something up or something wrong in order to get that bit of excitement going in me
3126772 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years and i probably still get asked you know am i the leading player in europe
3126773 but its six years that ive probably maintained that more or less
3126774 i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention to more to what im doing
3126775 theres lots of stuff i can work on i have been a learner in the game ive always applied myself looked for what would improve my game found that and worked on it to improve it and have improved it

3126805 a ffording same sex couples only a separate and differently named family relationship will as a realistic matter impose appreciable harm on same sex couples and their children because denying such couples access to the familiar and highly favored designation of marriage is likely to cast doubt on whether the official family relationship of same sex couples enjoys dignity equal to that of opposite sex couples
3126806 its the law of the state of california at present isnt that correct
3126807 its calculated to encourage people to vote against the measure

3126827 but if you understand the principles of storytelling you probably have a good understanding of yourself and of human nature and that tilts the odds in your favor

3126833 i read a whole new mind last year and i realized we have a great opportunity to differentiate our business through design and by offering products that tell stories

3126836 even solzhenitsyns expulsion from russia in 1974 only increased his notoriety as well as the impact of
3126837 not all of this was new credible witnesses had reported on the growth of the gulag and the spread of terror since the russian revolution
3126838 his manuscripts were read and pondered in silence and the thought he put into them provoked his readers to think too in the end his books mattered not because he was famous or notorious but because millions of soviet citizens recognized themselves in his work they read his books because they already knew that they were true
3126839 at first my presence only added to their general merriment
3126840 one of the men turned hostile why do you foreigners only care about the ugly things in our history he wanted to know why write about the gulag why not write about our achievements we were the first country to put a man into space by we he meant we soviets
3126841 his wife attacked me as well the gulag isnt relevant anymore she told me we have other troubles here we have unemployment we have crime why dont you write about our real problems instead of things that happened a long time ago
3126842 in my subsequent travels around russia i encountered these four attitudes to my project again and again its none of your business and its irrelevant were both common reactions silence or an absence of opinion as evinced by a shrug of the shoulders was probably the most frequent reaction but there were also people who understood why it was important to know about the past
3126843 yet although they lasted as long as the soviet union itself and although many millions of people passed through them the true history of the soviet unions concentration camps was until recently not at all well known
3126844 i first became aware of this problem several years ago when walking across the charles bridge a major tourist attraction in what was then newly democratic prague
3126845 the sight struck me as odd most of the people buying the soviet paraphernalia were americans and west europeans all would be sickened by the thought of wearing a swastika none objected however to wearing the hammer and sickle on a t shirt or a hat it was a minor observation but sometimes it is through just such minor observations that a cultural mood is best observed for here the lesson could not have been clearer while the symbol of one mass murder fills us with horror the symbol of another murder makes us laugh
3126846 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart

3126849 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3126850 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3126851 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3126852 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3126853 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3126856 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3126857 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3126858 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion
3126859 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3126880 justification of russia s actions in georgia by the need to protect its citizens is unacceptable alleged reasons for taking up a war against georgia raise concerns about the future in every state with russian citizens living on its territory
3126881 their approach was unique the site comprises a 30m wide body of water with 20 odd metres either side of bank so it is divided
3126882 everybody came up with a linear arrangement but agence ter overcame that by blurring the separation between the banks and the canal
3126883 we decided to consider the area as a whole by putting floating gardens into the water and putting water into the banks
3126884 when you walk along the liffey you are never close to the water which is understandable because of the tide and the boats but the canal is a very quiet place so the idea is to have floating gardens very low in the water
3126885 oh commemorate me where there is water canal water preferably just a canal bank seat for the passer by
3126886 but just to bring a new layer we need to keep an identity so the trees except in one pontoon in the next phase will be native species such as oak and white willow while the flower beds will be mostly planted with exotic plants many of which you already find in ireland it will be very colourful and we are working on year round blooming

3126911 we really dont know as much about obesity as we think we do
3126912 a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3126913 our study shows you can still be healthy even if you are obese
3126914 altogether 10 percent of the study population and 25 percent of the obese subjects had a high insulin sensitivity phenotype or metabolically benign obesity
3126915 our data suggest that ectopic fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3126916 thats an area that we are very intrigued with as well

3126929 you can just look around whenever you come when i invite people if the person thinks i dance well shell accept my invitation if she doesnt i dont care i can ask someone else
3126930 if you dance with your own people there are more problems
3126931 if you make a wrong move and your wife says youve stepped on my foot you have no other choice but to put up with it
3126932 you could dance during the cultural revolution but we didnt dance like the way we do today
3126933 they teach you how to move strategically how to hold the paddle how to move your feet theyre very warm hearted
3126934 i think it helps that you guys are filming all the time instead of just when im speaking in front of a big crowd speaking thats why this i absolutely believe has the potential to change how we do this in a very good way
3126935 the everyday elements in an out of door motif which arrest the cursory glance do so by containing something that interests us
3126936 a picture may possess every attribute of good composition decoratively speaking and still not be significantly composed
3126937 too much reality in a picture is always a disappointment to the imaginative soul
3126938 the difficulty of landscape painting lies in the fact that much study is required before the student can acquire enough accumulated experience or necessary knowledge to create
3126939 good composition is always determined by good selection fine painting is a matter of proper taste and judgment in choosing the motive accepting some parts discarding others and making changes or alterations throughout the procedure
3126940 when approaching nature for depiction the primary consideration is the station point which will give the best translation of the motive
3126941 in landscape two or three large trees are all one needs to construct a powerful composition
3126942 all painters of note realize the importance of simplicity in composition the subordination of detail consideration for artistic principles and requirements as well as a respect for outdoor form
3126943 learning to select and compose is largely a matter of self discipline
3126944 ruskin says in as many words that the great aim of composition is to create unity and that one feature should be the main interest and dominate all other interests or masses practically all other writers on art agree that this is the main principle in creating unified designs
3126945 composition means literally and simply putting several things together so as to make one thing out of them the nature and goodness of which they all have a share in producing
3126946 much more in a great picture every line and colour is so arranged as to advantage the rest
3126947 it seems to be appointed in order to remind us in all we do of the great laws of divine government and human polity that composition in the arts should strongly affect every order of mind however unlearned or thoughtless
3126948 it follows from these general truths that it is impossible to give rules which will enable you to compose
3126949 the painter john singer sargent 1856 1925 is reported to have said that he could be dropped off at any location and he would be able to paint a decent landscape at the site
3126950 the amount of real estate you attempt to present within the borders of a painting will affect the manner in which it will be created the amount of detailing required and the compositional devices available to you
3126951 there are of course many occasions when you will be interested in presenting a wide expanse of space and the smaller objects in front of it
3126952 if you are interested in the dramatic lighting effects across sky water and land then youll want to paint panoramic views from high vantage points when you are pulling together an expansive scene on one canvas the initial drawing of the landscape on the canvas is particularly important because it establishes the scale necessary for including all the important elements of the scene in some cases sections of land must be shortened and distances reduced in order to create a balanced and convincing picture
3126953 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3126954 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3126955 things which partake of perfection should not be looked at in haste but call for time judgment and intelligence the means employed in their appraisal must be the same as those used in their making
3126956 little is known about his upbringing he was sent off to a local school to study latin
3126957 the fundamental case to justify 150 a barrel oil never made sense
3126958 i think it was a speculative bubble that people tried to massage the fundamentals around
3126959 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3126960 it was unexpected because her recruitment and going to new york was done according to all the rules and regulations in accordance to us law and visa policy
3126961 i served the bajas for three months i cooked i took care of the child cleaned their really big house did the laundry ironed and did other tasks as a domestic worker in return they paid me with curses insults disrespect and 100 dollars
3126962 i was under the impression they would help me find work as a nurse instead i was forced to work as a servant for three months under abusive conditions
3126963 the moment she left my employ i immediately reported her to us immigration authorities so she is now an illegal alien and should be deported

3126969 this decision to allow the residents to purchase these properties was the right decision
3126970 home ownership stabilizes neighborhoods and allows families to build equity for the future i thank senator smith and assemblywoman pheffer and their colleagues in the legislature for their hard work on behalf of the residents of queens
3126971 with the signing of this bill governor paterson makes it possible for the homeowners on the beach 84th street pier to end decades of uncertainty with repairs and ownership rights
3126972 the pier is in disrepair and the bungalows have been there for almost 100 years it appears to be in everyones best interest to sell the property at the appraised value to the residents so they can legally fix up their property the city of new york is still responsible for repairs on the pier and after many decades of indecision the residents have a right to know that their home is theirs
3126973 home ownership is the backbone of a growing and vital community this legislation allows the longtime residents of the area ownership of their property i was most proud to have negotiated the mandate requiring the nyc department of parks provide funding equal to the assessed value of the property to remediate property in the borough of queens

3126979 its my opinion that nissan made a huge error by igniting these racist instincts
3126980 we need to apply punishments against these things in order for nissan to keep its interests in the region it must apologize

3126982 dont you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the kingdom of god dont fool yourselves

3126985 i am jesus the one you are persecuting now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do
3126986 go over to straight street to the house of judas when you get there ask for a man from tarsus named saul he is praying to me right now i have shown him a vision of a man named ananias coming in and laying hands on him so he can see again
3126987 ive heard many people talk about the terrible things this man has done to the believers in jerusalem and he is authorized by the leading priests to arrest everyone who calls upon your name
3126988 go for saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the gentiles and to kings as well as to the people of israel and i will show him how much he must suffer for my names sake
3126989 brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on the road has sent me so that you might regain your sight and be filled with the holy spirit
3126990 isnt this the same man who caused such devastation among jesus followers in jerusalem
3126991 and didnt he come here to arrest them and take them in chains to the leading priests

3127007 why does our brain seem to be wired to enjoy stories and how do the emotional and cognitive effects of a narrative influence our beliefs and real world decisions
3127008 able to independently discern the name maya kassandra soetoro from artifacts left behind in the process of forging a new fake document for barack from an image of mayas original document
3127009 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
3127010 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
3127011 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the secretaries of state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
3127012 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
3127013 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
3127014 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen
3127015 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
3127016 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
3127017 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
3127018 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
3127019 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states
3127020 no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president

3127026 cellcom isreal is the dominant cell phone provider in a country where more people use cell phones than almost anywhere else on earth
3127027 israelis use them at home instead of traditional fixed line phones every 12 year old kid has a cell phone glued to their ear but the market still has room to grow the nations population is growing at almost 2 a year thanks to a continuous influx of new immigrants
3127028 the economy has grown over 5 a year for the past four years and a healthy economy means more people with more money to spend on wireless services and spend they do telecom services accounts for over 4 of the nations economy
3127029 only three major operators are competing in this hot market each claims a large percentage of the countrys wireless market but the one with the biggest piece of the pie is cellcom israel with over three million customers it controls over 34 of the wireless market
3127030 since new management took the reins in late 2005 the company has upgraded its network and launched a variety of cutting edge products and services
3127031 cellcoms ultra fast 3g wireless network allows customers to use their phones for more than just voice communication subscribers can now text message download music or video conference revenue from these new data applications climbed over 45 last year
3127032 the companys dividend policy is to distribute at least 75 of annual net income to shareholders in quarterly installments besides the regular dividend management also seeks to distribute at least 50 of earnings each year
3127033 over the past year the company paid out 3 93 per share including regular quarterly dividends of 2 43 and a special payout of 1 50 that gives the stock a yield of 11 8 of the recent share price
3127034 according to israeli tax law the company must deduct at ource 20 of the dividend amount payable to u s shareholders
3127035 however u s investors can claim a foreign tax credit for this amount against their federal income tax the dividend should qualify for the 15 reduced dividend tax rate making the stock suitable for a taxable account theres no dividend reinvestment plan
3127036 israel is hardly a safe haven geopolitically but it does offer shelter from the financial tsunami on wall street moreover company operations have remained unaffected by tensions in the middle east
3127037 earnings are forecast to grow over 20 this year and average 9 10 growth over the next few years largely due to the companys data service business
3127038 cellcoms shares have enjoyed total returns of more than 40 over the past year in a down market but are still attractively priced
3127039 they are selling at just 11 times next years projected earnings which is a bargain considering the double digit dividend yield given the growing competition in the countrys wireless market however cel is suitable for a moderate risk investor

3127045 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place
3127046 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3127047 there has been a significant change in the market as the world is revaluing assets based upon the perceived health of their own economies as it relates to the suddenly stronger us economy

3127054 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3127055 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation
3127056 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3127057 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time

3127066 the goal of accreditation is to ensure that education provided by institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality
3127067 under u s department of education regulations institutions out of compliance with standards or on sanction are expected to correct deficiencies within a two year period or the commission must take action to terminate accreditation since the abovementioned recommendations were first noted by the commission in january 2005 as a result of the october 2004 comprehensive team visit the college has lapsed significantly beyond the departments two year rule and needs to be ensure these recommendations are completely resolved at the time of the october 2008 report

3127111 the only thing most people around here know how to do is grow sugar and play football

3127117 i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday
3127118 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
3127119 i have struggled ive really focused hard on the majors the last two years
3127120 my whole schedule is built around majors and definitely ive turned up at other events and unless i get into contention you know sometimes it feels like a race like a sprint whereas a major feels like a marathon
3127121 i feel like i can be patient and take my time and i love the feeling of knowing that its going to come down to the back nine its going to come down to who can do it under pressure in the last nine holes
3127122 that is an issue for me that i do have to play better when i feel confident about my game when in a normal week when i have plenty of good performances
3127123 i need the adrenaline i need to either be in contention or have something up or something wrong in order to get that bit of excitement going in me
3127124 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years and i probably still get asked you know am i the leading player in europe

3127144 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace

3127165 its a way of organizing information thats never been attempted before
3127166 i remember when i was in college i volunteered for an asifa fund raising event and i got a chance to chat with bill
3127167 he asked if i was a student and when i told him i was attending ucla he excitedly told me about his idea for an animatheque a museum library and archive devoted to the art of animation the resources just werent there to pull it off back in bills tenure as president of asifa hollywood but a few years ago i remembered bills idea and realized that computers had made organizing images text and video much easier when bill passed away his passion for the idea was transferred to me
3127168 the animation business in hollywood is in dire need of inspiration and new ideas
3127169 i kept reading in the trades that hand drawn animation was a dying medium and would soon be replaced by computer animation but i know from working with innovative filmmakers like ralph bakshi and john kricfalusi that the principles that created pinocchio and bugs bunny are the same ones that will lead new technologies to the same heights
3127170 the archive is the place for artists to grow through self study and research
3127171 everything an animator needs to know to perfect his craft and grow as an artist is in those old films and sketches it doesnt matter if they animate using a pencil or a computer all a student of animation today needs is access to the material a mind for analyzing what makes a scene work and lots of practice

3127212 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
3127213 why is secretary mike leavitt kowtowing to birth control companies and abortion activists
3127214 if he is seeking to protect conscience rights of those who want nothing to do with abortion he needs to recognize that contraceptives can cause abortions

3127219 we absolutely owed it to the iraqi people to help them rebuild and we did but we now know the maliki government has the means to take over the reconstruction it just refuses to spend the money because george bush and norm coleman are all too willing to pick up the check its time to take the training wheels off and end this culture of dependency norm coleman stood idly by while 48 billion of taxpayer dollars were appropriated for this botched reconstruction and just as his smoke and mirrors political ploy to rescind a small portion of that spending wont force the maliki government to change its behavior it wont fool minnesotans into thinking hes a responsible steward of their money
3127220 iraqs oil income will more than double this year even as baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds according to projections by u s government auditors
3127221 for 2008 gao estimates that iraq could generate between 73 5 billion and 86 2 billion in total revenues with oil exports accounting for between 66 5 billion to 79 2 billion projected 2008 oil revenues could be more than twice the average annual amount iraq generated from 2005 through 2007
3127222 for 2008 gao estimates a budget surplus of between 38 2 billion to 50 3 billion
3127223 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office

3127226 more than 30 billion in iraqi central bank reserves are held in the federal reserve bank of new york
3127227 since fiscal year 2003 congress has appropriated about 48 billion to u s agencies to finance stabilization and reconstruction efforts in iraq including developing iraqs security forces enhancing iraqs capacity to govern and rebuilding iraqs oil electricity and water sectors among others as of june 2008 of the 48 billion in appropriated u s funds from fiscal years 2003 through 2008 about 42 billion 88 percent had been obligated and about 32 billion 68 percent had been spent
3127228 this amount includes 2 billion appropriated in june 2008 for reconstruction and stabilization activities in iraq in the supplemental appropriations act 2008 this amount does not include 1 1 billion appropriated in the same act after october 1 2008 for similar activities in iraq
3127229 takes basically the same position on current matters as john mccain and president bush
3127230 coleman expressed virtually no doubts or ambivalence on any aspect of the war during its first four years until 2007 he never broke ranks with the bush administration nor the wars steadiest supporters on any vote
3127231 after four years of toeing the pro bush pro war line he wobbled slightly in early 2007 by doubting the wisdom of the surge he has since recanted those doubts thinks the war is going well and takes basically the same position on current matters as john mccain and president bush
3127232 based on what you know now was your support for the war then wrong
3127233 uh no no based on what i knew then i would have made the same decision
3127234 whatever the future brings we must stand with this president
3127235 this is one of those examples where you say hey this guy is way outside the mainstream
3127236 coleman acknowledges that he didnt schedule any hearings on those topics during his tenure as chairman he says that other committees had staff on the ground in iraq and were better positioned to oversee the reconstruction that congress with his support created a position and an agency for a special inspector general for iraqi reconstruction and that he never prevented any member of the psi from investigating reconstruction contracts
3127237 that would establish a new senate committee to investigate contracts issued for military operations and reconstruction
3127238 would have established a task force modeled on the truman committee during world war ii to probe contracting abuses stemming from the war in iraq and the gulf coast reconstruction
3127239 that would have created a special senate committee to investigate waste fraud and abuse in defense contracting principally in iraq and afghanistan

3127310 the whole of evolution in fact is an evolution from unconscious divinity to conscious divinity in which god himself essentially eternal and unchangeable assumes an infinite variety of forms enjoys an infinite variety of experiences and transcends an infinite variety of self imposed limitations evolution from the standpoint of the creator is a divine sport in which the unconditioned tests the infinitude of his absolute knowledge power and bliss in the midst of all conditions but evolution from the standpoint of the creature with his limited knowledge limited power limited capacity for enjoying bliss is an epic of alternating rest and struggle joy and sorrow love and hate until in the perfected man god balances the pairs of opposites and transcends duality then creature and creator recognise themselves as one changelessness is established in the midst of change eternity is experienced in the midst of time god knows himself as god unchangeable in essence infinite in manifestation ever experiencing the supreme bliss of self realisation in continually fresh awareness of himself by himself this realisation must and does take place only in the midst of life for it is only in the midst of life that limitation can be experienced and transcended and that subsequent freedom from limitation can be enjoyed

3127366 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3127390 you cant transmit that if you only have a backhaul of 4 to 5mbit s of the t1 lines typically going to these cell sites
3127391 two years ago i said lte will dominate through wimax could be big and convergence of the two technologies is a still the case
3127392 that blessing really established lte as the default network of choice and verizons planned move from cdma to lte was significant also

3127417 under the appearance of virtue and bad spirited zeal would turn upon religion who nourished them at her breast
3127418 insomuch as this poor country will lack the christian spirit the sacrament of extreme unction will be little esteemed many people will die without receiving it either because of the negligence of their families or their false sentimentality that tries to protect the sick from seeing the gravity of their situations or because they will rebel against the spirit of the catholic church impelled by the malice of the devil thus many souls will be deprived of innumerable graces consolations and the strength they need to make that great leap from time to eternity
3127419 as for the sacrament of matrimony which symbolizes the union of christ with his church it will be attacked and profaned in the fullest sense of the word masonry which will then be in power will enact iniquitous laws with the objective of doing away with this sacrament making it easy for everyone to live in sin encouraging the procreation of illegitimate children born without the blessing of the church the christian spirit will rapidly decay extinguishing the precious light of faith until if reaches the point that there will be an almost total and general corruption of customs the effects of secular education will increase which will be one reason for the lack of priestly and religious vocations
3127420 the sacred sacrament of holy orders will be ridiculed oppressed and despised the demon will try to persecute the ministers of the lord in every possible way and he will labor with cruel and subtle astuteness to deviate them from the spirit of their vocation corrupting many of them these corrupted priests who will scandalize the christian people will incite the hatred of the bad christians and the enemies of the roman catholic and apostolic church to fall upon all priests this apparent triumph of satan will bring enormous sufferings to the good pastors of the church
3127421 moreover in these unhappy times there will be unbridled luxury which acting thus to snare the rest into sin will conquer innumerable frivolous souls who will be lost innocence will almost no longer be found in children nor modesty in women in this supreme moment of need of the church those who should speak will fall silent
3127422 but know beloved daughter that when your name is made known in the 20th century there will be many who will not believe claiming that this devotion is not pleasing to god a simple humble faith in the truth of my apparitions to you my predilect child will be reserved for humble and fervent souls docile to the inspirations of grace for our heavenly father communicates his secrets to the simple of heart and not to those whose hearts are inflated with pride pretending to know what they do not or self satisfied with empty knowledge
3127423 the secular clergy will leave much to be desired because priests will become careless in their sacred duties lacking the divine compass they will stray from the road traced by god for the priestly ministry and they will become attached to wealth and riches which they will unduly strive to obtain how the church will suffer during this dark night lacking a prelate and father to guide them with paternal love gentleness strength wisdom and prudence many priests will lose their spirit placing their souls in great danger this will mark the arrival of my hour
3127424 therefore clamor insistently without tiring and weep with bitter tears in the privacy of your heart imploring our celestial father that for love of the eucharistic heart of my most holy son and his precious blood shed with such generosity and the profound bitterness and sufferings of his cruel passion and death he might take pity on his ministers and bring to an end those ominous times sending to this church the prelate who will restore the spirit of its priests
3127425 this signifies the most august sacrament of the eucharist which will be distributed by my catholic priests to faithful christians belonging to the holy roman catholic and apostolic church whose visible head is the pope the king of christianity his pontifical infallibility will be declared a dogma of the faith by the same pope chosen to proclaim the dogma of the mystery of my immaculate conception he will be persecuted and imprisoned in the vatican by the unjust usurpation of the pontifical states through the iniquity envy and avarice of an earthly monarch
3127426 in the 19th century there will be a truly catholic president a man of character whom god our lord will give the palm of martyrdom on the square adjoining this convent he will consecrate the republic to the sacred heart of my most holy son and this consecration will sustain the catholic religion in the years that will follow which will be ill fated ones for the church these years during which the evil sect of masonry will take control of the civil government will see a cruel persecution of all religious communities and they will also strike out violently against this one of mine

3127431 t he great virtue of smart people attributable to noam murros easygoing direction as well as to mr poiriers wandering screenplay lies in its general preference for small insights over grand revelations
3127432 a small sharp and pleasingly literate comedy poiriers script is full of nicely offhand slap down banter
3127433 k nowing pleasingly literate and modishly melancholy comedy drama as smart as its title suggests

3127460 the situation over the caucasus remains tense and until the conflict is brought to an end the market is likely to continue moving down
3127461 over the past two trading sessions the russian market was severely hit by the military conflict in south ossetia which is currently spreading over a broader territory
3127462 russias involvement in the conflict in the caucasus region caused not only a collapse on the stock market but capital outflow and devaluation of the ruble against the bicurrency basket by around 2 3 in two days
3127463 extremely bad news from the political front has overshadowed russias strong macroeconomic performance
3127464 russia was a safe haven for investors seems to be for the foreseeable future over
3127465 going forward the russian markets will remain under pressure for as long as there is no move toward a resolution of the conflict
3127466 in addition further falls in oil prices could add to the downward pressure on russian assets
3127467 caution is thus clearly warranted in the russian financial markets
3127468 while warfare is never a good thing fundamentally russias economy and infrastructure are not affected
3127469 this vulnerability also means that internally the system is not mature enough to be able to absorb external shocks

3127498 the georgian rulers which used tanks to run over children and the elderly which threw civilians into cellars and burnt them they are players that have to be protected
3127499 its 50 people whose houses appear to have sustained significant damage
3127500 the buildings are standing but theyve sustained significant damage siding ripped off obviously windows smashed i dont believe there are houses that have been demolished
3127501 ive got our kids at my house ive got a dog with no food
3127502 ive got to get clothes to go to work its just a mess
3127503 we need to know exactly the nature of any potential threat before were in a position to move anybody into the area
3127504 police did a really good job they took care of the plaza
3127505 im disappointed with the government that they would allow anything like a propane company to be situated where it is in the middle of a heavy residential area
3127506 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
3127507 rather than acting as a neutral peacekeeper russia has escalated the hostilities through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside the conflict zone
3127508 canada calls on russia to respect georgias borders and to desist from any further encroachment on georgias territorial integrity
3127509 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3127510 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shia villages
3127511 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3127514 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
3127515 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
3127516 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
3127517 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it

3127519 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact
3127520 it seems inevitable that the forest will change and some of the native species will lose out
3127521 we know that if birds are not present to fulfill that role there often is nothing else that can do it
3127522 the implications are severe and thats why we consider bird conservation to be so important
3127523 unfortunately guam is a laboratory of sorts for what happens when an invasive species brings major change
3127524 you cant really see it yet but it appears that the indirect consequences for the forest can be as important as the direct consequences we saw on the bird population

3127526 if i was going to be an assistant coach it wasnt going to be with any other organization to be honest the fact that its ruud gullit makes it possible for me to do this unless it was someone of his stature i probably wouldnt have put myself in the position of being the assistant coach
3127527 well that makes sense even if gullit does well i dont really see him staying in mls hell probably go back to europe at some point and then cobi can step up and in
3127528 thats always the possibility im not writing off anything but i know that my immediate future is to be the assistant coach here id say that it doesnt put me on a different path it opens up another path
3127529 sometimes there are forces behind the scenes the only certainty you have as a coach is that youre going to be sacked
3127530 we are the los angeles galaxy we are going to attract attention i think that was one of the points that was made clear you need to be able to perform under pressure thats something that i think all the players that are in there need to learn but it shouldnt be stressful you should relish that i did i loved it
3127531 for three reasons the xo turned out to be a gross provocation to the big players in the computer industry first it was always going to be cheap undercutting the competition by thousands computers only cost as much as they do because the makers of the software primarily microsoft go to enormous lengths to make their products necessary and expensive and because makers of the hardware are constantly adding new features that you probably dont need

3127538 i got it years ago from karen you remember als friend she came to dinner one christmas
3127539 oh come on grandma got mad because you invited strangers to dinner so she trotted out her cross and played the martyr for the rest of the day and then you asked al to carve and he had to go home for his carving set since yours was not up to his standards
3127540 id forgot that and we had to wait while he showed off with his sharpening steel
3127541 yes indeed i think grandma was already mad because you opened her present to you when she wasnt in the room so beth offered to re wrap it so we could recreate the moment then she got mad at beth who she never got mad at
3127542 i really would have re wrapped it i wasnt being sarcastic
3127543 that reminds me auntie which holiday did you smack grandmas head on the floor
3127544 fathers day and i did not smack her on the floor she was writhing around and i wasnt trying to calm her down
3127545 well i tripped her after she dumped daddys plate in his lap i kicked her legs out from under her and thats how we ended up on the floor i sent her flowers the next day
3127546 i might have slugged mother at some point but i didnt have any room in my budget for sending flowers
3127547 the one when chuck told grandma it was time to go home and on the way to the car she tripped over that little wire fence that edged the planter she got so mad she ripped the whole fence out and threw it in the middle of the street i think you took a picture of it laying in the street and hung it on the refrigerator
3127548 you know the irony of this is that all of us kids had to spend the evening in your camper in the driveway because you were afraid we would misbehave while you had guests over why didnt you ever send grandma out there
3127549 how do you remember this did you write it all down

3127571 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
3127572 the problem is new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses

3127583 hes the most important acquisition weve made in the past year playing the most important position
3127584 the stuff he brings to the table on and off the field is exactly what were looking for

3127648 in its technical meaning hermeneutics is often defined as the science and art of biblical interpretation hermeneutics is considered a science because it has rules and these rules can be classified into an orderly system it is considered an art because communication is flexible and therefore a mechanical and rigid application of rules will sometimes distort the true meaning of a communication to be a good interpreter one must learn the rules of hermeneutics as well as the art of applying those rules

3127681 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3127682 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3127683 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3127684 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3127685 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3127686 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3127687 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3127688 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3127689 i know fc twente quite well as i have dutch satellite
3127690 it was quite though a big shock because in holland everyone expected ajax to win and in the end twente played better and these things happen in football
3127691 they had a great year last year but they lost two of their best playmakers karim el ahmadi and orlando engelaar
3127692 however they got theo janssen from vitesse so they are still in good shape with a good team
3127693 fc twente are really happy with him and almost proud to have him because it was quite a strange move to come from england manager to twente
3127694 but they are all saying they really like his style of coaching

3127700 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about videogames
3127701 to some parents videogames are full of unknowable dangers while researching for grand theft childhood parents we spoke with in focus groups often bemoaned the fact that they didnt know how to use game controls and felt unequipped to supervise or limit videogame play of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk
3127702 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex

3127724 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3127725 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3127726 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3127727 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3127728 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3127729 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3127730 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3127731 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3127732 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3127733 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3127734 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3127735 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3127736 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3127737 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3127738 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3127742 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3127743 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3127744 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3127745 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3127746 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3127747 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3127748 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3127749 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3127750 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3127751 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3127752 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3127753 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3127754 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3127755 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3127756 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3127769 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3127770 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3127771 the greatest discovery of my generation is that man can alter his life simply by altering his attitude of mind

3127802 they represented a model of what the markets are supposed to do and look like and then clients can build algorithms to fit those models
3127803 the system is open enough to allow the use of plug ins so that users can look at factors that we havent even thought of they can use to create new orders types and make decisions
3127804 its not possible to have all the right answers or predict what markets will look like or six months before events occur

3127830 at this juncture the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the sub prime market seems likely to be contained
3127831 we will follow developments in the sub prime market closely however fundamental factors including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates should ultimately support the demand for housing and at this point the troubles in the sub prime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
3127832 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy
3127833 weve got strong financial institutions our markets are the envy of the world theyre resilient theyre innovative theyre flexible i think we move very quickly to address situations in this country and as i said our financial institutions are strong

3127839 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3127840 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3127841 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3127842 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3127843 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3127844 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3127845 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3127846 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3127847 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3127848 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3127849 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3127850 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3127851 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3127852 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3127853 once again ethics watchs complaint has brought transparency and accountability to the political process in colorado dr geddes conceded that his committee violated campaign finance laws by failing to file contribution and expenditure reports and has been ordered to pay the full fine of 4000 now dr geddes has filed the requisite disclosures and has been held accountable for shirking the law ethics watch will continue to protect coloradans interests by researching identifying and exposing candidates and public officials who violate the law

3127871 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3127872 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3127873 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3127874 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3127875 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3127876 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3127877 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3127878 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3127879 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3127880 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself
3127881 students across central florida will learn a brutal lesson in economics when the new school year starts next week for years school leaders juggled their budgets to prevent the states chronic money woes from creeping into the classroom but theyre out of options now and scaling back popular programs for gifted students and troubled kids

3127884 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
3127885 the problem is new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses

3127906 nuclear threats and counter threats are a subtext of our times steadily it seems becoming more insistent the july meeting in geneva between iran and six major world powers on irans nuclear programme ended with no progress
3127907 california high school student erik choquettes three minute film calling on the united states to take a lead role in eliminating the worlds 27 000 nuclear weapons was recently awarded first place in a national video contest on nuclear disarmament
3127908 banning nuclear weapons prohibiting the use of poison gases or outlawing germ warfare will not remove the root causes of war

3127911 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3127912 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct

3127948 you can have a great site with great water quality and you can have a bunch of crabs come in and rip the plants out
3127949 but theres no harm in trying the only way we are going to learn is by trying it and observing those plants
3127950 i dont know if im confident but were hopeful that we will and i understand weve narrowed it down to at least a smaller group of people
3127951 my dilemma is that i only have a vague image of who it was who was talking to me and id hate to pin it on the wrong person but you know if you see faces again they can revive memories so well just have to see
3127952 were just quietly and methodically working our way through it
3127953 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
3127954 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
3127955 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
3127956 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
3127957 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
3127958 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
3127959 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
3127960 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
3127961 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
3127962 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
3127963 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
3127964 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
3127965 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
3127966 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
3127967 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
3127968 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
3127969 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
3127970 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
3127971 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
3127972 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
3127973 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
3127974 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
3127975 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
3127976 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone
3127977 traditionally over the last 30 or 40 years some treatments have crept into our repertoire without being robustly tested
3127978 what we found rather surprisingly is these treatments did not produce a greater chance of pregnancy leading to live birth compared to no treatment
3127979 the message of this trial is people should think more carefully about going into these treatments as a fait accompli

3128048 in the past the we offered about 15 meta tactics or generic tactics that are the base of the system
3128049 they represented a model of what the markets are supposed to do and look like and then clients can build algorithms to fit those models
3128050 the system is open enough to allow the use of plug ins so that users can look at factors that we havent even thought of they can use to create new orders types and make decisions
3128051 its not possible to have all the right answers or predict what markets will look like or six months before events occur
3128052 a trader can use what he has been working on in the past and test those strategies on discreet orders then apply them to algorithms
3128053 he alan panettiere is in custody for spousal assault she lesley panettiere called the sheriffs station and the responding deputy called the paramedics she refused medical treatment and was hit more than once on the cheek while they were arguing
3128054 alan was upset because he felt disrespected at a party they argued he hit her multiple times he left i dont know if hayden was there or who else was in the house
3128055 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda macs wife she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3128056 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
3128057 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from

3128080 i had done some minor investigative stuff earlier but i managed to really make my mark with the 2004 election
3128081 my reporting took off based on my skill set with database research thats what was called upon to analyze computer records in the election
3128082 eventually people began to find me and send confidential information
3128083 they trusted me to tell the story better than professional journalists the stuff i had dug up went into the trial about the election
3128084 i think sound politics has a diversity of opinion that you dont get from many newspapers
3128085 i have a blend of original reporting commentary and snark were a loosely based collective everyone has his or her own style and interests id say thats partly why were successful
3128086 i spent a lot of time blogging but it was time to move on
3128087 the opportunity costs were too great i needed to earn a living
3128088 even though this is a left of center area in politics overall there certainly is a market for a more conservative point of view
3128089 i believe our regular readership extends well outside of seattle encompassing the broader puget sound area and to some degree the whole state moreover quality and or entertaining writing seems to have its own draw
3128090 when i started out in 2004 i couldnt get a party official to return my call now theyre inviting me to the dncc
3128091 im simply a damn good read something even many of my righty critics will admit
3128092 ha is the only local liberal blog thats built on muckraking ive always been the go to blogger for dishing the dirt people like dirt
3128093 i want to have fun with politics yet i also want to get stuff done
3128094 i want to be edgy outspoken and occasionally foul mouthed and yet i want to maintain my credibility with stuffy politicos and even stuffier editorial boards sometimes wonkish sometimes satirical but always truthful ha is an opportunity to speak my mind while enjoying the delusion that others actually care what i have to say it is pure unadulterated me
3128095 one of the comments i occasionally get is something along the lines that profanity is a last resort of people who are otherwise incapable of expressing themselves which is of course a load of shit
3128096 in fact this critique itself is nothing more than a crutch for those who cant refute me theyre essentially saying look see goldy curses so you can dismiss everything he said thats just lazy rhetoric on their part these are words powerful words and like all my words i choose them very carefully im a writer
3128097 i was happy to play my part once cast in it
3128098 you know reporters if theres a conservative blogger there has to be a liberal blogger to balance him out and because the capital press corps was already familiar with me i was the obvious choice stefan also stupidly got into a pissing match with me again upping my profile and increasing my traffic so i thank him
3128099 i wouldnt say goldstein and i are buddies either but weve had pleasant conversations together i even went to
3128100 i know there are folks at the times who think i have a chip on my shoulder but if i do it is because i resent the fact that they so blithely dismiss me when i am at least as good a writer and political analyst as any columnist or editorialist on their staff
3128101 perhaps instead of bemoaning the changing media environment and blaming the internet for undermining their business model they should re examine the quality of their own content and consider the possibility that they might stem the steady decline in their readership if only they offered a more compelling product
3128102 wars and elections are both too big and too small to matter in the long run the daily work that goes on it adds up
3128103 i just put fresh produce out front of the deli when the hail started craziest thing ive ever seen as far as weather all you heard was ding ding ding ding

3128113 and so when the outside world is going to take his house he ties all his surplus balloons fills them with helium and floats his entire house up into the sky off to south america thats the image of the film it kind of defies description because its moving its emotional its active but its weirdly poetic and doesnt make a lot of logical sense and yet its really the cornerstone of the film
3128114 weve described it as a coming of old age story
3128115 its really like an unfinished love story is kind of the way were talking about it this wonderful romance this guy had with his wife and she passes away and its the unfinished business of dealing with that the little kid also has things he needs to deal with and so the two of them end up really needing each other and helping to finish each others business
3128116 theres a whole other separate team thats following along thats doing the stereo version were going to educate each other on whats the best way to do the 3 d thing

3128128 the company cannot predict or determine the timing or final outcome of the investigations or the effect that any adverse findings in the investigations may have on it
3128129 intends to attempt to negotiate a settlement with prosecutors and regulatory authorities with respect to these matters that would allow us to quantify our exposure associated with reimbursement of losses and payment of regulatory and or criminal fines if they are imposed however no settlement has been reached with any regulatory authority and the company believes that although it is probable that a liability exists related to this exposure it is not reasonably estimable at this time

3128134 this is the only place in the world where we know for certain that a greco roman library was entombed in a manner that ensured its preservation
3128135 there are almost certainly more books to be found there
3128136 the villa remains one of the great buildings of the ancient world and it should certainly be excavated
3128137 this would be true even if we were to find no further papyri though the likelihood that we will find them adds much to the case the building will certainly contain many other things and is of unique historical interest if we know of a site that should be excavated and we have the capacity let us get on with it of all the sites in the world this one ranks close to the top of the list for potential and historical importance
3128138 we have a big problem with the water if we excavate here after one month we have a metre of water
3128139 they make this cavity this cave it is not soclear and they bring into view only a small part and when they finish we have to manage the cave
3128140 our task is to preserve what is found but it is very difficult to project an entire excavation digging at the villa thats a huge undertaking we would have to change streets demolish houses and change the lives of thousands of people in ercolano and portici it is a problem for the mayors it is a political decision in the true sense of the word
3128141 for me they must open and read all the papyri they have had for centuries before we look for others
3128142 if i want to eat a meal at my home i dont go to the supermarket if i have a full fridge
3128143 parts of the villa where the ancient diggers dont go
3128144 but they are not what can we do about nature
3128145 today i think the method of archeology is not to find treasures
3128146 it is amazing to claim that it is treasure hunting when one asks to have the papyri excavated before vesuvius buries them definitively
3128147 if lava flows over the site again i doubt we will ever have access to them
3128148 as for the publication of all the papyri being demanded before more are excavated might one ask that the whole of pompeii and herculaneum be properly published before anything more there is unearthed it seems to me to be arrogance to deny future generations the opportunity to read more such books just because there are at present very few classical scholars with the competence and the energy to decipher and bring out those that we do have
3128149 there are of course serious issues about conservation and the interface with the modern city which are not to be dismissed lightly
3128150 they are solvable there is huge potential also for an excavation to contribute to the local economy and urban regeneration if agreement could be reached on options
3128151 empty is that philosophers argument by which no human suffering is therapeutically treated
3128152 for just as there is no use for a medical art that does not cast out the sickness of the body so there is no use in philosophy unless it casts out the sickness of the soul
3128153 we have a secret weapon we shall cease to be your enemy
3128154 based on the significant findings of the dimebon 12 month pivotal trial in alzheimers disease recently published in the lancet as well as the promising results from our phase 2 study in huntingtons disease announced last month we believe dimebon is among the most promising drug candidates being investigated today to treat patients with debilitating and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative diseases
3128155 we are making excellent progress opening u s sites and enrolling patients in our confirmatory phase 3 trial of dimebon in alzheimers disease and remain on target to complete the study in time to file for u s marketing approval for alzheimers disease in 2010 in addition we continue to increase the dose and enroll patients in our ongoing phase 1 2 study of mdv3100 for castration resistant prostate cancer we remain on track for completing that study later this year after which we intend to seek fda approval to enter phase 3 in 2009
3128156 in conclusion the lowest 25 oh d quartile less than 17 8 nanograms per milliliter is associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in the general u s population
3128157 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations if confirmed randomized clinical trials will be needed to determine whether vitamin d supplementation at higher doses could have any potential benefit in reducing future mortality risk in those with 25 oh d deficiency
3128158 this study supports the use of 11c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3128159 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation
3128160 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3128161 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3128162 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3128163 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life
3128164 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages
3128165 increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors may not only improve length and quality of life but also hopefully lead to reduced health care expenditures associated with disability and chronic diseases
3128166 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3128167 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3128168 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
3128169 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3128170 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3128171 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3128172 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia
3128173 carl marks managed an efficient process and was an invaluable asset throughout this successful transaction
3128174 we believe the logic controls brand will continue to grow under the auspices of bematech
3128175 we were pleased to work with jackson and his team at logic controls to execute this cross border transaction
3128176 we believe significant synergies exist between the two companies which will only strengthen logic controls already formidable reputation as a leader in the pos and kds markets while providing bematech with a broader line of pos products
3128177 the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and this epidemic is accompanied by a high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
3128178 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3128179 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3128180 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3128181 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3128182 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3128183 both reports emphasize the benign nature of fat accumulation outside the abdomen
3128184 in both studies the detrimental effect of visceral fat accumulation and its surrogate waist circumference were clearly demonstrated confirming older studies showing that waist circumference is a risk factor even in normal weight individuals
3128185 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3128186 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3128187 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3128188 we couldnt be more delighted and proud to kick off our inaugural slate of hot ticket programming with cirque du soleils delirium
3128189 its the perfect marriage to have such a visually exciting multimedia show as delirium showcased in theaters in state of the art high definition presentation it is stunning to experience the show in this way and it sounds amazing its truly the next best thing to being there and experiencing the show live and i believe audiences will be blown away by the incredibly creative and talented artists acrobats and performers that make up the world renowned cirque du soleil troupe
3128190 we are happy to take this opportunity to bring the cirque du soleil experience to a new entertainment environment
3128191 we believe that delirium in hd will offer audiences a memorable experience in movie theaters because of its magnitude the energy of the performers and the diversity of its music going from percussion to electronic music
3128192 i am really happy with this one of a kind production since the use of twenty cameras allowed us to both capture the spectacular scale and nature of the show along with the incredible skill and intimate interaction of the fabulous cirque du soleil artists this unique cinema experience will be a delight for the viewers

3128197 we are only about three weeks from completion of our final two pivotal trials for technosphere insulin importantly our team was satisfied with the outcome from our july 14 pre nda meeting with the fda our science preclinical and clinical programs have enabled us to target year end to complete preparation of the nda though that is an aggressive target
3128198 our new danbury factory is virtually complete and we are looking forward to the dedication on september 17 this factory is being equipped in modular steps to meet our expected demand for technosphere insulin our other products are also moving forward and clinical progress for our glp 1 formulation and two cancer vaccines continues to be very promising as al mann said this is an exciting time full of promise for the future
3128199 over the past three years our goal was to give our customers the complete dacor kitchen with the introduction of built in refrigeration and dishwashers we are now able to offer full lines of luxury appliances in a variety of styles and finishes
3128200 this year we have refocused our attention on what made dacor the innovative leader in the culinary arena cooking with a renewed focus on our legendary cooking appliances we launched the 27
3128201 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3128202 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3128203 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3128204 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3128205 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3128206 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3128207 how long how long how long to the point of no return
3128208 our strong second quarter results provide further validation that our strategy to diversify our operations expand our wholesale activities internationally and prudently invest in network infrastructure is working
3128209 since the start of the year we have improved the key performance metrics of our wholesale and retail divisions including sales gross margins net income account receivables customer wins and call volumes we expect this steady growth to continue for the balance of 2008 based on the increasing demand for our telecommunications services particularly within emerging markets in asia africa and south america we expect this trend to continue in q3 as we have just completed our most profitable month ever in july
3128210 during the second quarter of this year we continued to make advances with respect to the on going development and our commercialization plans for both anx 530 vinorelbine emulsion as well as anx 514 docetaxel emulsion
3128211 we continued to make progress with regard to the preparation of our nda submission for anx 530 as well as conducting our registrational bioequivalence clinical study of anx 514 furthermore we made a considerable investment of capital this quarter in order to initiate large scale manufacturing to prepare for the commercial launch of both anx 530 and anx 514 this is a significant endeavor that will help enable us to successfully launch these product candidates if they are approved as well we announced response rate data from 2 separate studies of cofactor r our third oncology product candidate we continue to evaluate cofactor and expect to provide further updates with respect to the program as we gather additional data
3128212 thanks to the leadership of john boehner and roy blunt and thanks to the sacrifice being made by dozens of members of congress and their families we have held this hill for one week but still there is no sign of speaker nancy pelosi or any house democrats in the peoples house
3128213 republicans in congress have taken this stand on capitol hill and across the nation in town halls and coffee shops to protest the fact that congress took a five week paid vacation without ever taking a vote on giving the american people more access to american oil
3128214 we will stand our ground we will take our case to the american people and we will not relent until the speaker of the house calls congress back into session and allows a vote on a comprehensive energy bill that includes more drilling
3128215 if he said hes iron man in the first film its one thing to say it and another thing to evolve to a point where you can live in a heroic fashion
3128216 its a contemporary version of a classic tale but were not telling one of the stories from the books
3128217 the cool thing about sherlock is hes a very skilled martial artist
3128218 so its not just about is deductions this movie will also be a very action packed version of sherlock holmes
3128219 the american people have a particular sense of fairness todays debate is not about forcing people to like drilling for oil its about having a vote and allowing the american people to express their will
3128220 as the saying goes 90 percent of life is showing up were not even showing up we usually pass all the appropriations bills by july 4 this year weve passed one and were in august recess
3128221 you may not agree with what weve proposed to do about energy but with the american people suffering under 4 per gallon gas we at least should be here sitting around the table trying to work out some kind of bipartisan solution
3128222 were not being productive enough if we have time to rename post offices and pass monkey laws and honor national carriage driver week then we have time to address the serious problem of gas prices
3128223 normally in a debate the republicans speak then the democrats speak and then we have a vote thats all we are asking for here today we are not wedded to one specific solution what we are wedded to is the deliberative process what we ask of you madam speaker is to call the house back into session and have a vote on american resources
3128224 i was sitting on a plane and i got this message the american people have taken over the peoples house this is the closest thing to a pure democracy ive ever experienced
3128225 our families our hurting i met a woman in bridge city that cant go to church because she cant afford the gas school lunch prices are being raised to cover the fuel costs
3128226 democrats have a common sense plan to lower gas prices

3128230 as we continue to make significant investments towards our long term growth initiatives such as euro millennium and fixcity we are also continuing to focus on improving the cost structure of our core businesses
3128231 the investments we made in our infrastructure during 2007 and our increased emphasis on our more profitable businesses are providing us with greater operating leverage as we move forward
3128232 our second quarter results reflect the combination of a less levered operating strategy and reduced volatility in overall market conditions liquidity has stabilized and we are generating net positive cash flow from operations that is being conservatively invested in short term highly liquid securities pending longer term strategic deployment of those funds
3128233 we are also very pleased to have closed our first transaction in our previously announced cdo roll up strategy and believe deerfield is well positioned in the marketplace to secure more of these types of transactions
3128234 with this share repurchase program we are affirming our confidence in the long term future of the company we continue to actively explore opportunities to increase long term value for our shareholders

3128240 i know the audience seeks another rishi kapoor in me but i can never be like him he is such a spontaneous actor
3128241 no one can play the role of bobby like dimple kapadia did she is still so beautiful and i would love to woo her on screen again if a remake is made
3128242 i play a next door boy and the film is about his love life at different phases of life
3128243 in both saawariya and bachna ae haseeno i play a lover boy but wont keep myself confined to that particular image give me two years and you will find me beating up goons and kicking in the air
3128244 my first film saawariya was not a commercially hit one though it was the best possible launch that one can ever have but this time i expect my film to be a commercially hit one
3128245 both of us have just started our career we would appreciate if people talk about the film and our characters instead of linking our personal life with the romance on screen
3128246 right from amitabh bachchan to darsheel safary bollywood has never been so competitive every day a new actor takes the reign as a result we actors have to constantly groom ourselves
3128247 we delivered strong results this quarter which included achieving positive net income and continued levered free cash flow creation
3128248 we achieved strong performance which was particularly impressive when considering the prevailing economic headwinds while we continued to invest in significant ongoing customer opportunities our results demonstrate the strength of our product portfolio which leverages our metro capabilities across a diverse nationwide fiber footprint we continue to focus on mission critical needs of enterprise customers and believe tw telecom is well positioned for the long term with the strength of our fiber based network innovative cost effective solutions the ability to win market share and a strong balance sheet
3128249 we experienced strong margin expansion by executing on both revenue opportunities and integration cost savings our performance for the quarter yielded us a 34 0 m ebitda margin which is already within our targeted post integration guidance range of mid 30 we are pleased with our performance and see opportunities to further expand our m ebitda margin while balancing this goal with our objectives of revenue and cash flow growth
3128250 our diverse nationwide local market presence comprehensive product portfolio and strong customer base helped generate another strong quarter
3128251 although we have seen some select pockets of pressure from the macro economic environment on a local market basis our overall market strength largely offset these impacts and our sales funnel was strong for the quarter customer churn was 1 5 for the current quarter compared to 1 3 for the same period last year and was 1 4 for the prior quarter the vast majority of the higher customer turnover was from our very small acquired 2 customers that are below our service profile and we expect this churn may continue we believe these customers were likely also impacted by the soft economy
3128252 tw telecom is a powerful force in serving business customers
3128253 we remain focused on driving sales growth and growing cash flow by leveraging our national footprint and robust product portfolio to further penetrate the enterprise market place and grow our market share
3128254 we dont go back in session until september 8 and this leaves us hanging out there the whole time

3128289 the guy that wins this year will get 1 000
3128290 he probably paid 500 dollars for his car and he probably put a couple hundred dollars in getting it ready for the derby so then after you pay the entry fees and he hasnt got a whole lot left if he wins it
3128291 its a guys sport and for a lady to come in there its very challenging
3128292 i enjoy that i know theres a lot of guys that dont want me to be here but theyre fair to me last year they didnt pick on me theyre fair they treated me just like a guy out there
3128293 no matter what you do youre going to spend money and this is a hobby

3128295 he represented the school at indoor hockey cricket cross country athletics and football
3128296 he was very good at the 400 metres and i think he still holds the school record
3128297 there are loads of lads who want to be professional footballers and jason represented the school at football he could have probably gone on to have a career at the game but he chose cycling
3128298 he went down to the velodrome with his dad and in his gcse in pe he got top marks for cycling
3128299 then he joined manchester wheelers and went into cycling with a lot of enthusiasm
3128300 he was a quiet lad but he had a very dry sense of humour and he was very well liked by his peers he would say it as a joke but he was a very focused lad and very determined which is obviously important for his cycling
3128301 im very pleased that hes got where he is and it wouldnt surprise me at all if he came away with something
3128302 people are saying 2012 but because of the nature of the lad he could do something big in beijing im sure he wont be going there to make up the numbers

3128305 the trial worked out really well for me it is a kind of a mixed emotion when you get selected you want everyone in the team to do well and it is strange to be competing against people you train with and with only one spot available
3128306 it was quite nerve wracking watching them as they get faster and faster and thinking he wasnt going that well a week ago you have to ignore it and concentrate only on what you are doing and not on them
3128307 napster delivered a solid first quarter of 30 3 million in sales which was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 reflecting the beginning of the summer season
3128308 our continued focus on expenses resulted in cash flow positive results for our fifth consecutive quarter and we are pleased to begin to see the positive impacts from both the launch of our new mp3 store and the expansion of napster mobile the introduction of mp3
3128309 we expect our second fiscal quarter revenue to be approximately 30 million depending on the pace of our napster mobile roll outs including new compatible handsets and carrier promotions as well as other new marketing initiatives

3128316 whether it goes toward support of our faculty our students or our campus and whether for current use or endowment the inspiring generosity of our alumni and many other friends allows the entire university of chicago community to continue to make extraordinary contributions to knowledge and to society
3128317 this campaign is an unprecedented success for the worldwide community of alumni and other friends of the university of chicago who stretched themselves in support of continuing excellence
3128318 the founding of the university of chicago depended on hundreds of chicagoans who responded to a challenge gift from mr rockefeller that tradition of support from neighbors community leaders and businesses in chicago is stronger than ever and the university has thus been able to continue to expand its engagement with the support of this great city
3128319 the success of the university of chicago is the success of its faculty its students its worldwide community of alumni and philanthropic partners who have chosen to invest in knowledge creation and service to society through the university
3128320 this core mission creation of knowledge and enrichment of human life involves by definition work that is never completed we look forward to continued partnership with philanthropists those who can give 5 and those who can give 500 million whose vision for their own giving can be achieved through the extraordinary people and programs of the university of chicago

3128324 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3128325 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3128326 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3128327 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3128328 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3128329 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3128330 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3128331 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3128332 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect
3128333 this study supports the use of 11c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3128334 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation
3128335 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3128336 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3128337 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3128338 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life
3128339 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages
3128340 increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors may not only improve length and quality of life but also hopefully lead to reduced health care expenditures associated with disability and chronic diseases
3128341 the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and this epidemic is accompanied by a high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
3128342 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3128343 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3128344 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3128345 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3128346 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3128347 both reports emphasize the benign nature of fat accumulation outside the abdomen
3128348 in both studies the detrimental effect of visceral fat accumulation and its surrogate waist circumference were clearly demonstrated confirming older studies showing that waist circumference is a risk factor even in normal weight individuals
3128349 in conclusion the lowest 25 oh d quartile less than 17 8 nanograms per milliliter is associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in the general u s population
3128350 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations if confirmed randomized clinical trials will be needed to determine whether vitamin d supplementation at higher doses could have any potential benefit in reducing future mortality risk in those with 25 oh d deficiency
3128351 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3128352 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3128353 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3128354 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3128355 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3128356 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3128357 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia
3128358 it was that democrats are united around a commitment to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care

3128362 seen 40 years after it first stormed the middle class citadel of musical comedy hair registers as an eloquent requiem not only for the idealism of one generation but also for the evanescence of youth itself it s still the tribal love rock celebration it was always advertised as being but in suggesting the dawning age of aquarius is already destined for nightfall this production establishes the show as more than a vivacious period piece hair it seems has deeper roots than anyone remembered
3128363 the show still rocks but it no longer shocks the profanity nudity and odes to sodomy and

3128391 the white house stepped up its criticism of russia for escalating the conflict in georgia with president bush warning monday that russias disproportionate response is unacceptable
3128392 the maneuver suggested that russias aims had gone beyond securing the enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia to weakening the armed forces of georgia

3128433 first we learned that the federal budget deficit could reach nearly half a trillion dollars next year eight years after we had a record surplus were now faced with record deficits this mortgaging of our childrens future is a direct result of the bush administrations dangerously failed fiscal policies
3128434 the second thing we learned this week was that the iraqi government now has a 79 billion budget surplus thanks to their windfall oil profits
3128435 and while this iraqi money sits in american banks american taxpayers continue to spend 10 billion a month to defend and rebuild iraq
3128436 thats right america faces a huge budget deficit iraq has a surplus now senator mccain promises to continue president bushs open ended commitment to the war in iraq while refusing to pressure iraqis to take responsibility for their own country
3128437 as you may know the democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an illinois state senator named barack obama hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance
3128438 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates senator obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
3128439 in the meantime let me take a stab at a plot summary of the obama campaign america is finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it

3128463 we were looking for a scroller to recommend for use with our news portal
3128464 but we just couldnt find anything that worked reliably and which also had the range of features we know our customers need so we made our own
3128465 a few hosting services wanted to partner with us in a similar fashion but we chose lunarpages because weve tested their service and we found that their hosting service is both joomla friendly and ijoomla friendly
3128466 all our extensions can be uploaded to their servers with no permissions or ioncube problems thats why they are the hosting service we recommend for joomla and ijoomla

3128468 no matter whether you support or oppose the beijing government we see the olympics as an achievement for all the chinese people everywhere
3128469 its for what hosting the olympics means to the history of the chinese people
3128470 the olympics are a big milestone for chinese around the world
3128471 while im glad that china has this opportunity to expose itself to the world if the government simply uses this to justify everything they do then it wont be good for openness and debate

3128474 this is telling you that being a runner being active is going to reduce your disability and its going to increase your survival
3128475 late in life you still see the benefit of vigorous activity
3128476 illness would be compressed between later age of onset and age of death and that paradigm was controversial because it went against conventional wisdom and had no proof
3128477 running delayed the onset of disability by an average of 16 years and that is largely a conservative number because the control group was pretty darn healthy
3128478 i always thought that the two curves would start to parallel each other and that eventually aging would overpower exercise
3128479 i think that will happen but we cant find even a little twitch toward that gap narrowing in the present time
3128480 vigorous activity has a really dramatic impact but we cant ignore that there are also helpful benefits to people who are active at all levels meaning those people who are just out walking
3128481 its so important to be physically active your whole life not just in your 20s or 40s but forever
3128482 exercise is like the most potent drug exercise is by far the best thing you can do

3128486 the internet is so competitive now that any online business that doesnt collect detailed data about its users is going to be left behind
3128487 the key is to do it in a way thats meaningful for entrepreneurs and fun for users
3128488 this component allows site owners to improve their business and increase revenue by collecting highly relevant data
3128489 if a site wants to stay hot its going to have to plug in the component and start talking to its visitors
3128490 we used ijoomla coms news portal and it really is a pretty slick application if your main landing page is your homepage why dont you make things as easy to as possible for them in fact give them the meat turn your homepage into your application if you are a content site give them the most popular and recent content
3128491 were constantly receiving e mails from our customers asking where they can go for help in making their sites look great so we asked our customers who are web designers with extensive experience using our products to add themselves to our new directory the response has been great so far this gives the opportunity to help out the ijoomla community and our web designer customers the chance to reach out to new clients its a win win

3128493 it is possible that poor weather conditions particularly in central and eastern canada magnified the decline in construction
3128494 it was the second consecutive monthly decline and the most significant since december last year
3128495 the overall level of new residential construction activity recorded in july fell significantly short of expectations for a total of 210 000 starts
3128496 but it was ontarios 28 per cent pullback in starts that weighed the most on national figures
3128497 the price softening housing market is mostly due to western canada
3128498 calgary about two years ago was at almost 60 per cent increases but now its at 0 1 per cent in july
3128499 thats really been the drive in the last two years is whats happening in alberta
3128500 is downshifting from the elevated rates of activity of recent years
3128501 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
3128502 as an average for this year its possible just given how high starts were in the first half of the year
3128503 in the second half of this year housing starts will be far lower quite likely under 200 000
3128504 one should not read too much into an oversized drop in multiple starts in a single month the month to month volatility in this market segment is remarkably high on both the upside and downside
3128505 should experience a cooling after running too hot for too long
3128506 will continue to moderate in some cities we will see outright declines as were already seeing in calgary edmonton and victoria
3128507 obamas response has been all over the map matching consensus global opinion at first he blamed both georgia and russia then called for russia to withdraw now hes demanding an immediate cease fire events are in the saddle and obama is going along for the ride this matches president bushs approach to the crisis and thats not a good thing
3128508 unless mccain is willing to get the us in the middle of every armed conflict on earth giving new definition to his promise of more wars a mccain presidency would mean that were at least going to enter a new age of foreign policy brinkmanship that will demand a military sufficient to fight these battles that means either getting out of iraq or reinstating a draft because the military today is incapable of matching mccains rhetoric
3128509 high levels of standard equipment and value for money as well as strong active and passive safety fuel efficiency and clean engine technology are all part of the package we have put together for the mk5 and mk6s
3128510 the new mks join the gws and pks we launched in australia earlier this year and will add to uds solid and highly respected reputation for trucks that perform and return strongly on the investment
3128511 like its bigger brothers the new mk range takes a big step up in every area they are very impressive medium duty trucks which will further help ud to build its market share in australia
3128512 the addition of an allison automatic option on the mk6 will greatly add to the appeal of the ud product particularly against our competitors some of whom do not feature an automatic while others are offering an automated manual transmission amt trucks
3128513 the automatic is a major plus for us and we believe will be a better option than amt in this size of truck

3128524 its all very well to talk like this about the gospel but surely what owen is doing is defending limited atonement one of the five points of calvinism when you speak of recovering the gospel dont you mean that you just want us all to become calvinists
3128525 taking away their heart of stone and giving unto them a heart of flesh renewing their wills and by his almighty power determining them to that which is good and effectually drawing them to jesus christ yet so as they come most freely being made willing by his grace

3128530 seems to us blasphemously injurious to the wisdom power and perfection of god as likewise derogatory to the worth and value of the death of christ

3128532 dont you mean that you just want us all to become calvinists
3128533 its very simple just open your heart to the lord
3128534 a certain infallible truth grounded upon the superabundant sufficiency of the oblation of christ in itself for whomsoever few or more it be intended
3128535 a serious full recumbency and rolling of the soul upon christ in the promise of the gospel as an all sufficient saviour able to deliver and save to the utmost them that come to god by him ready able and willing through the preciousness of his blood and sufficiency of his ransom to save every soul that shall freely give up themselves unto him for that end
3128536 there is none called on by the gospel once to enquire after the purpose and intention of god concerning the particular object of the death of christ every one being fully assured that his death shall be profitable to them that believe in him and obey him
3128537 it lies on a believer to assure his soul according as he find the fruit of the death of christ in him and towards him of the good will and eternal love of god to him in sending his son to die for him in particular
3128538 consider the infinite condescension and love of christ in his invitations and calls of you to come unto him for life deliverance mercy grace peace and eternal salvation
3128539 this is somewhat of the word which he now speaks unto you why will ye die
3128540 these and the like things doth the lord christ continually declare proclaim plead and urge upon the souls of sinners he doth it in the preaching of the word as if he were present with you stood amongst you and spake personally to every one of you he hath appointed the ministers of the gospel to appear before you and to deal with you in his stead avowing as his own the invitations which are given you in his name 2 cor v 19 20
3128541 thus saith the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls
3128542 a more than seven years serious inquiry into the mind of god about these things with a serious perusal of all which i could attain that the wit of man in former or latter days hath published in opposition to the truth
3128543 altogether hopeless of success i am not but fully resolved that i shall not live to see a solid answer given unto it
3128544 admitting that by the purpose of god and through the death of christ the elect are infallibly secured in the enjoyment of salvation they contended for an antecedent decree by which god is free to give salvation to all men through christ on the condition that they believe on him hence their system was termed hypothetic al universalism the vital difference between it and the strict arminian theory lies in the absolute security asserted in the former for the spiritual recovery of the elect they agree however in attributing some kind of universality to the atonement and in maintaining that on a certain condition within the reach of fulfilment by all men all men have access to the benefits of christs death
3128545 the readers of owen will understand why he dwells with peculiar keenness and reiteration of statement upon a refutation of the conditional system it was plausible it had many learned men for its advocates it had obtained currency in the foreign churches and it seems to have been embraced by more
3128546 a great sectary that did much hurt in lincolnshire norfolk and cambridgeshire who was famous also in boston kings lynn and even in holland and was followed from place to place by many
3128547 owen travels through it his subject with the elephants grace and solid step if sometimes also with his ungainly motion

3128555 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3128556 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3128557 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3128558 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3128559 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3128564 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3128691 last years acquisition of isotis and the expansion of integras extremities reconstruction business were extensions of the strategy the recently announced acquisition of theken spine reinforces our commitment to the high growth segments of orthopedics while we will run the neurosurgery extremities orthobiologic and spine businesses separately they will reinforce each other and all will benefit from our leading position in tissue engineering

3128718 these are our electricians our plumbers our housemaids and our drivers they are the backbone of our economic success and yet they live in slums
3128719 there is a serious flaw in the government policies that guide our economy there needs to be more government initiative to care for these workers and give them a bigger share of the wealth
3128720 ideally we want to formalise our entire workforce give them pensions and health benefits and so on but thats going to take a long time
3128721 the informal sector is an extremely important transition between the rural areas and the cities it allows the people to learn different trades that are more useful and better paying
3128722 corruption is a cancer that steals from the poor eats away at governance and moral fibre and destroys trust
3128723 the challenge for the world bank is how best to diagnose determine and clean out corruption in concert with developing and developed countries
3128724 the social and portable inbox optimizing e mail marketing in the new era of communication tools
3128725 since only the government could give something concrete to improve alberto fujimoris future
3128726 on the other hand it is key to see until when jorge del castillo serves as vice president and who will replace him
3128727 del castillos head served on a platter to fujimoristas in exchange for votes
3128728 support a request for house arrest for fujimori and a pardon if condemned
3128729 later had to admit that the situation coincides with other external factors that dont have much to do with the institute of legal medicine
3128730 thanks to the apra government fujimori has parties and is visited by artists painting teachers politicians advisors publicists and even witches
3128731 the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil for which some have strayed away from the faith truth in their greediness and pierced themselves through with many sorrows rewards
3128732 if you have the money honey ive got the time
3128733 dont care about them they are tempted their brains are washed what do they know about the love between us
3128734 atat rk could leave the power but he did not
3128735 the french government having accepted responsibility for the protection of the armenian people the british government will consent to the immediate despatch of french troops via alexandretta iskenderun and mersina mersin for this purpose
3128736 relocation of armenians from eastern anatolia and from settlements along ottoman lines of communication to northern syria needless to say the still untamed nomads east of the amanus range needed no pretext whatever to set upon the caravans of unarmed deportees
3128737 the allies have the right to occupy any strategic points n the event of any situation arising which threatens the security of the allies
3128738 free use by allied hips of all ports and anchorages now in turkish occupation
3128739 in case of disorder in the armenian vilayets the allies serve the right to occupy any part of them
3128740 the armenians were a dangerous lot to get mixed up with they requested a great deal of money and gave very little satisfaction
3128741 independence courts during the years 1920 23 for collaboration with the enemy
3128742 should prove feasible for france if armenia were excluded from turkey and if her maritime provinces i e izmir and antalya were retained to bear the cost p 157 moreover as french officials at beirut and adana clung to their perceptions of kemals dependence on unionists germans and bolsheviks another riddle to the turkish settlement surfaced for their colleagues at istanbul in the light of nationalist goals revealed through personal contacts and the public utterances of the kemalists the kemalists made it quite clear that they aimed at the integrity and complete independence of all territory west of the caucasus frontier established by the treaty of brest litovsk and held by turkey upon the signing of her armistice this territory included of course cilicia and vicinity p 157 158 although french archives do not disclose any reply to this recommendation paris did indicate a shift in support of the policies pursued at istanbul by consistently prohibiting the participation of french troops in any ally action that threatened confrontation with turkish units thus again in contrast to british practice the quai dorsay refused to release any forces to man the milne line between opposing turkish and greek units in western anatolia during the fall of 1919 p 160 161 he further committed france to the support of turkish cessions of land in eastern anatolia to the republic of armenia in brief the viable turkey

3128744 ozanian died shortly after the lausanne conference where the armenian national cause virtually died as an international cause and was buried in fresno california his remains were transferred to the new republic of armenia only quite recently
3128745 there are studies that link low vitamin d levels to the development of heart disease peripheral arterial disease diabetes hypertension and different cancers
3128746 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
3128747 i think people should optimize their diet and sun exposure to get an adequate level of vitamin d without taking supplements
3128748 it may be a good idea for people who are at risk for vitamin d deficiency including african americans and people who dont spend a lot of time in the sun to get their vitamin d levels checked by their doctor
3128749 we know that being vitamin d sufficient reduces the risk of having your first heart attack by more than 50 percent reduces the risk of having peripheral vascular disease by as much is 80 percent and decreases the risk of prostate colon breast and a whole host of other cancers by as much is 50 to 70 percent

3128753 do you mean that you would go to the white house and complain to the president of your own party and talk to the press and talk to your constituents about things that werent being done the way you like it and you would go there and knock on the door and lodge complaints and lobby them
3128754 i should be a member of congress and i am going to run

3128759 a president obama would have a good strong relationship with russia and this sort of thing wouldnt happen
3128760 we are 100 per cent certain there will be a demo for 360 99 per cent certain there will be a demo for ps3 and about 50 per cent certain there will be a demo for pc
3128761 im still not certain exactly when the best time to release the demo will be there are two camps
3128762 yeah baby theyd hurt you and i doubt youd even be able to cry by the time they were done

3128766 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3128767 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3128768 we know that deaths come one to a customer eventually we will have a 100 percent mortality rate in both groups
3128769 when we first began there was skepticism about our ideas

3128771 he just wanted to go home after three and a half years in the orange county jail
3128772 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3128773 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3128774 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3128775 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3128776 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3128777 he uses philosophy psychology and the intuitive to find resolutions that move people back into alignment with the universe and into a place of peace harmony and joy
3128778 bob uses the intuitive to help people with a variety of life issues including relationships career and health
3128779 his knowledge of the past and the future helps people find balance in the present
3128780 he is able to separate out surrounding negative energy which allows people to have a clearer perception of their own options and choices
3128781 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3128782 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3128783 by 55 to 33 iowans who will take part in a jan
3128784 second even after its forceful 50 basis point interest rate hike on july 17 the bsp has hardened expectations for additional hikes in the overnight borrowing rate possibly as soon as the aug 28 monetary policy meeting posing upside risks to our economists forecast of just one more 25 basis point hike by yearend
3128785 the bsps willingness to use the overnight borrowing rate currently at 5 75 percent as a foreign exchange policy tool combined with still lingering selling pressures on the peso suggests further rate hikes
3128786 short term pressure on the peso may also be foreshadowed by the bsps procurement of an unusual 500 million three month loan from the bis bank for international settlement to bolster forex reserves
3128787 moreover the likelihood of resilient second quarter 2008 growth facilitates the bsps tightening cycle
3128788 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3128789 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3128790 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3128791 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3128792 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3128793 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
3128794 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did
3128795 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3128796 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3128797 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3128798 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3128799 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3128800 when all is said and done the real citadel of strength of any community is in the hearts and minds and desires of those who dwell there
3128801 ill be sitting in bkb on londons old compton street opposite g a y and see those guys coming out with a different man every night and im just like you lucky b s i would give anything to have that kind of lifestyle but the girls just wont have it

3128807 ellias dreams instructions fill with all the dreams amp wishes you have sit back relax enjoy some coffee play with the kids and watch them come true
3128808 if i had more money i would have stayed and never gone back
3128809 we hear from other returnees that they had regret going back because there is still bombing kidnapping and killing
3128810 god willing the flights will continue in order to fetch all families that wish to come back we welcome all our citizens who want to come home
3128811 some iraqis are choosing to return because the situation has improved in their areas but many others find themselves under many pressures in the host countries as their savings and resources have been exhausted
3128812 im concerned that i will not be able go out freely whenever and wherever i want like i used to do in egypt
3128813 i dont know how we are going to cope with our new lives it is going to be hard with no security electricity or enough drinkable water
3128814 it is of our duty to rebuild our country and to help rid it of sectarianism
3128815 look at the double standards of this government it did not help us during all the bad times in exile but when it came to its own political gains they sent a plane to get us back probably to our death
3128816 nobody wants to be in a sinking ship they want to be on the right side at this crucial moment
3128817 we remain close allies in the war on terror and will continue our close ties with the democratically elected government of pakistan
3128818 i took the risk and came out of twice bombed mamund because even though we were spared in the bombing we may starve as no supply is coming up there
3128819 hugged my niece and said she was also his daughter and cried
3128820 some of them criminals are taken to the jails but because they belong to the commanders they pay money and are set free
3128821 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3128822 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3128823 these days all these young girls are going to school and coming out of their houses these criminals chase after them
3128824 this is like a revolt against the warlords by my family
3128825 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
3128826 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3128827 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3128828 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3128829 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3128830 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
3128831 weve adapted quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt the battle space to account for their loss
3128832 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
3128833 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
3128834 if they dont pull it out of theaters wed like for people to hear what were upset about to not go and see the film and boycott screenings
3128835 i understand the studio director and writers were trying to be over the top but in doing so around the use of the word retard they really crossed the line my biggest fear is high school boys will see this thing and think its cool to use this word and play with it the way its played with in the movie
3128836 were gonna do our best to let hollywood and distributors know that its not ok to make money playing off these harmful stereotypes
3128837 but my sense after the conference call is they want to do something with us
3128838 but perhaps pregnant women started dying on the island in the first place because of ben because he stopped devoting himself completely to the island and got too wrapped up in annie as a punishment the island made it so that no one else could ever have children and ben would have to bear the guilt of that situation
3128839 experiments to study the kerr metric solution of the einstein field equations
3128840 the kerr metric is used to describe the rotation of black holes and how everything including light
3128841 none of that matters it doesnt matter just get to it please
3128842 this is useless alright its just useless theyll never gonna see this pierre how do i turn this off
3128843 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3128844 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished

3128852 o que estamos vivendo uma corre o nos pre os das commodities que estavam altos
3128853 com a alta de pre os muitos consumidores deixaram de comprar nos volumes que estavam acostumados principalmente nos pa ses ricos onde a desacelera o da economia clara o resultado que o mercado se auto regulou e os pre os voltaram a cair
3128854 a expans o das exporta es brasileiras pode n o ocorrer nas mesmas taxas o pico nos pre os das commodities pode ter passado
3128855 os produtos incentivados pelos pre os plantaram mais e as perspectivas de safra na europa s o muito boas neste ano
3128856 o resultado desse novo cen rio pode ser uma queda substancial no super vit brasileiro
3128857 a bonanza nos pre os das commodities n o duraria mesmo para sempre
3128858 i suppose it would be a bit of a pain if i wasnt able to check cnn or my bank account balance
3128859 softbanks other handsets might have drawn interest in the wake of the iphones release as well
3128860 we are however not sure if the impact will continue from now
3128861 w e believe our large net growth was an iphone effect
3128862 before i always thought the speech was about how unfair black women had been treated
3128863 were most concerned about saskatchewan where the doubling of house prices in both regina and saskatoon over the past two years has led us to estimate that these two markets are now close to 50 per cent overvalued

3128866 its communicating with god we wouldnt be able to foster an intimate relationship if we didnt talk to our best friend on a regular basis its our way of speaking to god and the bible is when god speaks to us we need to pray so we can see our prayers answered to strengthen our faith
3128867 praying in the name of my lord and savior jesus christ
3128868 our father who art in heaven hallowed by thy name
3128869 what a novel idea prayer as a means of becoming more preoccupied with the beauty of jesus name than paralyzed by the burden of our needs
3128870 i will expect loyalty today and in the future in every situation but especially in situations as important as polands safety from every government worker
3128871 not everyone passes this test of loyalty as it appears
3128872 i got the impression that political interests were more important than the safety of the nation
3128873 during talks among donald tusk radoslaw sikorski and minister slawomir nowak there were opinions that a project is unacceptable if it could be seen in public opinion as the presidents success
3128874 ricordate che i veri uomini non spiegano mai gli acronimi li capiscono per via genetica
3128875 for some moments there are no words that can describe what youre experiencing
3128876 do you remember that time i insisted on taking the scenic way home from lake cumberland even though you wanted to take the interstate and we ran out of gas and ended up walking 8 miles to the nearest gas station
3128877 it is the broker the means of detached and dispassionate interaction between parties with opposed interests buyers want a low price sellers wants a high price the market works out the price that exactly balances these desires a price that is fair because it is the market price
3128878 context of any transaction so long as that transaction is not directly dictated by the state the word has no content of its own because it is defined simply and by reasons of politics by what it is not the market is the nonstate and thus it can do everything the state can do but with none of the procedures or rules or limitations it is a disembodied decision maker a maxwells demon who somehow and without effort balances and reflects the preferences of everyone participating in economic decisions it can be these things precisely because it is nothing at all
3128879 can anyone in modern american politics deny the markets existence or even its relevance
3128880 to do so would be political suicide precisely like denying the existence of god
3128881 may be imperfect that under certain conditions it may fail
3128882 an overwhelming critique of the very concept of the market
3128883 a pill that cures is good a pill that you take every day is better
3128884 economic man is a machine to whom whimsy and evolution are unknown
3128885 man is inconsistent changeable sometimes though not consistently irrational his judgment biased and distorted and influenced by his peers
3128886 the collective judgment of millions of people around the world
3128887 turned the whole world into a parliamentary system whose citizens vote every hour of every day through their mutual funds their pension funds their brokers and more and more from their own basements via the internet
3128888 modern behavioral economics has begun to show that the actual behavior of presumptively competent people
3128889 ordinary intelligent people appear consistently unwilling or unable to calculate the consequences of their decisions in a manner predicted by the view that they are responding purely to the market instead they act as social beings concerned about their standing with their peers about the fairness of the deal they are being offered and other matters quite irrelevant to the utility of the object or money on offer
3128890 the autonomous individual is not the active agent who matters most
3128891 the capacity to adjust the presentation of such products to what research and experience indicate the public will actually buy
3128892 the capacity to influence the publics buying preferences through advertising
3128893 free to choose only among a menu of items set out for sale
3128894 the freedom to shop is for the rest of us an incident to this freedom
3128895 he concept of a freedom to shop has been extended insidiously into the realm of careers where it plays even greater havoc with the normal use of words in a free capitalist society with private schools and universities free to admit whom they please and charge what the market will bear the freedom to choose ones profession becomes in part the freedom to become what one can afford to become

3128897 we would be very grateful if the health care industry recognizes that we have this problem
3128898 this plan in no way can be considered a balance of shared sacrifice when entire sectors are exempted from it
3128899 we have gone from suggestions of shared sacrifice to making hospitals and nursing homes into sacrificial lambs
3128900 governor paterson is right to propose actions and bring everyone to the table to address the states growing budget problems now rather than later
3128901 delay will only increase the degree of difficulty in fixing our problems
3128902 it may seem a bit of a lift for the health care area largely because weve eschewed the opportunity to cut education
3128903 we thought wed start with health care and return to education perhaps next year
3128904 i felt that he was looking me in a mirror
3128905 small men entered each turn in the machine from above after being raised in the air and plunging head inside head first
3128906 no fewer than 62 students aged 8 to 12 years observing the
3128907 the reason too that i have taken this so seriously is that the impact of this information about the earth is extraordinary for the experiencers they become literally viscerally devastated by it they will weep about it they will become aware as carlos diaz is a mexican experiencer i wrote about of the virtually infinite delicate relationship between various life forms they will literally weep over what is happening so they are not just liberal environmentalists they experience this through the core of their being many of them become active on behalf of the planet teach about it talk about it if they find people who will listen
3128908 the whole thing is now explained there is some conventional physical way to explain it

3128910 leaves for another day the question of how and to whom the award should be distributed

3128929 creemos que tanto el concejal de hacienda y personal como el concejal de deportes y festejos no han estado a la altura de las circunstancias en el ltimo pleno trat ndose de un tema tan importante como son las cuentas p blicas donde los ciudadanos del municipio tienen una implicaci n directa
3128930 como vecino del municipio de polanco el ltimo pleno nos ha generado una profunda desconfianza y un cierto nerviosismo debido a que el equipo de gobierno no ha sabido o no ha querido dar cifras exactas en cuanto a las subvenciones concedidas y por no conocer el montante econ mico gastado hasta el d a de hoy en la implantaci n de terminales de presencia considerando este hecho un ejercicio de irresponsabilidad por parte del actual gobierno
3128931 la gesti n del dinero p blico se debe de tratar desde la responsabilidad que genera un cargo de concejal conociendo en todo momento en que estado se encuentran los presupuestos que en su d a fueron aprobados con el consenso de todos los grupos pol ticos
3128932 su riguroso cumplimiento porque si las condiciones cambian de c mo estaban en el proyecto inicial esto debe ser objeto de un nuevo consenso entre todos porque de lo contrario se esta generando desconfianza entre los ciudadanos m s en la actual delicada situaci n econ mica en que nos encontramos
3128933 creemos que hay que incrementar el gasto en pol ticas sociales en el siguiente presupuesto y no invertirlo en problemas de segundo nivel

3128954 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field though it is the smallest of the seed yet when it grows it is the largest of the garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches

3128961 a state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny

3128967 generosity is a two edged virtue for an artist it nourishes his imagination but has a fatal effect on his routine
3128968 the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between political parties either but right through every human heart
3128969 for a country to have a great writer is like having a second government that is why no regime has ever loved great writers only minor ones
3128970 hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century and more than anywhere else this disease is reflected in the press
3128971 it is not because the truth is too difficult to see that we make mistakes we make mistakes because the easiest and most comfortable course for us is to seek insight where it accords with our emotions especially selfish ones
3128972 one should never direct people towards happiness because happiness too is an idol of the market place one should direct them towards mutual affection a beast gnawing at its prey can be happy too but only human beings can feel affection for each other and this is the highest achievement they can aspire to
3128973 there also exists another alliance at first glance a strange one a surprising one but if you think about it in fact one which is well grounded and easy to understand this is the alliance between our communist leaders and your capitalists this alliance is not new we observe continuous and steady support by the businessmen of the west of the soviet communist leaders
3128974 and how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain as to whether he would return alive and had to say good bye to his family or if during periods of mass arrests for example in leningrad when they arrested a quarter of the entire city people had not simply sat there in their lairs paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and every step on the staircase but had understood they had nothing left to lose and boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes hammers pokers or whatever else was at hand the state organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and notwithstanding all of stalins thirst the cursed machine would have ground to a halt if if if but we didnt love freedom enough and even more we had no awareness of the real situation we purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward
3128975 i am of course confident that i will fulfill my tasks as a writer in all circumstances from my grave even more successfully and more irrefutably than in my lifetime

3128980 this is a broader and more important collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models
3128981 the cells will allow researchers access for the first time to cell types of interest to watch the disease progress in a dish to watch what goes right or wrong well see in the years ahead that this opens the door to a new way of treating degenerative disease
3128982 that is where all of the science will go on over the next many many years
3128983 even though the ips methodology gives us a facile way for making disease specific lines it does not eliminate the value or need for continuing to study human embryonic stem cells
3128984 those are really the gold standard for pluripotent stem cell types they have no genetic modifications and at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue beyond that are going to be extremely valuable tools human embryonic stem cells allow you to ask questions that we never can ask with ips cells
3128985 whether or not were going to be able to figure out how to do it without viruses so we can use the cells therapeutically is as of today an unanswered question
3128986 im confident were going to get there and that within the next year or two we will have several strategies for reprogramming cells without viruses and when that happens we may have cells in our hands that may be valuable for cell replacement therapy
3128987 in these complex genetic diseases were so ignorant at the moment we dont even know if patients who get type 1 diabetes all get it the same way there could be 50 different ways to get type 1 diabetes
3128988 we started writing new songs for this album the first week of january while simultaneously planning a mid west tour of america in february and recording our comin atcha live 2008 dvd while we were on the road coming home in march we hired terry to jump back into writing and recording music with us while we edited the dvd and routed a summer tour of europe were riding a wave of energy that doesnt come easy for a band of rookies much less a band whose been doing this for over 20 years and we wouldnt have it any other way
3128989 we jumped right back into the studio to work on forever more with terry while setting up a tour of american festival shows in july and august playing alongside bands such as matchbox twenty the wallflowers queensr che kiss and judas priest its great that we can play with any band of any music genre because weve never been pigeon holed into a style or label of music throughout our career
3128990 forever more demonstrates this idea of writing songs in a diverse fashion the title track is one of our deeper cuts complete with heavy lyrics de tuned riffs and acoustic interludes while i wanna live is one of our more uplifting songs that bounces musically and delivers a lyrical message that suggests living life to the fullest

3129039 theres about eight guys in the world who can win that gold medal
3129040 he just has to go out and execute and do his job hes ready
3129041 it wasnt until i went to one of those national selection matches and found i had a serious talent for international skeet and really started shooting that in 2005 that this olympic dream really came forward
3129042 i had a realization at those matches in 2005 that i had the ability and talent to pursue this
3129043 after the last shot i took and broke the last target i knew i made it my eyes were filled with tears and i was full of joy that i got over the rollercoaster that were the olympic trials
3129044 hes shooting around 200 rounds a day hes shooting lights out right now hes really pumped up
3129045 his scores every day on 150 to 200 targets hes only dropping one or two targets
3129046 ive been shooting the last two months and i definitely expect to medal thats a goal
3129047 my confidence is very high going into this ive been training really really hard the last three months and i believe all the hard work is going to pay off

3129052 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3129053 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes
3129054 as long as it doesnt hit you over the head
3129055 i think its important to show what kids really use

3129059 most of his output from the 1980s and 90s is sentimental rubbish
3129060 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person
3129061 i believe that its always best to be upfront with someone when you have strong opinions about their work or their image simply as a gesture of respect or if the respect isnt there then purely as professionalism had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask
3129062 ive never had a letter from someone in the big league before its actually made him go up in my estimation he just wants respect for his work and i think good on him for making direct contact
3129063 i thought he may be an non resident indian from canada or united states
3129064 i shouted oh my god an indian has won the olympic gold
3129065 im a little short and that may affect my execution in the air
3129066 but it will be ok if i pay attention to it
3129067 this was a technical mistake and i dont think it was nerves i was a bit too pressed up at the beginning of the dive and didnt have a strong entry

3129071 ive never worn a faster suit than were about to wear its definitely going to change a lot of records in the record books
3129072 i dont like that they come to the competition with the swimsuits just the day before the competition starts
3129073 i like that there are better suits and we can swim faster because thats good for everyone in my opinion but it hasnt been equal for all the swimmers

3129078 you could see cullens discipline and how much he wanted to win
3129079 im just fortunate that i had the opportunity to work with him you can coach a long long time and coach a lot of great swimmers and coach a lot of nice young men and women and still many coaches go through their whole careers and never get a moment like that
3129080 cullen is just the nicest young man and to see his dreams come true and to get to be on the podium and to hear the star spangled banner play i know thats s moment all swimmers dream of and very few get to live it in reality
3129081 you could not have a better example for any race than what cullen is for african americans
3129082 o prisoner of desires and formal acts of worship o prisoner of stations and revelations
3129083 almost seven years after the september 11 2001 terror attacks readers still display a surprising hunger for the definitive 9 11 novel if fiction cannot cope with the biggest event of our lifetimes then its long prophesied death is surely at hand
3129084 experience of the psychology and milieu of the revolutionaries led him to become their outspoken foe to the point that he became known as a leading reactionary and slavophile yet like so many great conservatives his writing was always marked by his early radicalism
3129085 i could probably never have become a nechayev who convinced 4 fellow revolutionaries to kill the 5th of their group but a nechayevite though i cant be sure i possibly might have become one in my young days

3129138 when i look back the thing that blows my mind is how young she was when we met but she had this wisdom with a lot of actors youve got to chip through the surface to see who the real person is but she didnt have any of that she was this very tough smart very real person incredibly emotional and passionate it didnt seem weird to me that we were getting married and having kids so quickly
3129139 i wish american television would stop using tiananmen square as a set this is a freaking grave this is a place where a really bad thing happened we would not tolerate french television coming to new york and using ground zero as a backdrop for talking about how happy and merry new yorkers are the corporations that own and sponsor the us coverage of the olympics have to tap dance around the chinese human rights record but my lord lets not use this place as a backdrop people died there

3129151 the teams surpassed that goal reducing costs by 800 million at the end of 2004 this figure was up to 1 1 billion in 2005 the teams added another 300 million to the tally
3129152 the many millions who tuned in for the opening ceremony are a good omen for that and the encouraging news continued with the audience figures for the first full day of action

3129154 ill have you know people on the internet dont like this
3129155 not yet we are not through yet there are always sticky points of course in any such dialogue but we are overcoming
3129156 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
3129157 it is hard to imagine how south ossetia can ever be persuaded to reintegrate with georgia after this
3129158 the conflict may cause second thoughts about the transit related risks associated with georgia for some international oil and gas projects intended to bypass russia such as odessa brody
3129159 kazakhstan should also be concerned about the reliability of exporting its petroleum through azerbaijan and georgia
3129160 we have postponed the sale until markets recover and we see a more suitable time to go for an offering
3129161 now i have lots of work ahead as he is the countrys most eligible bachelor
3129162 its the thrill of my life thats about it i just went for it i knew i was lying fourth
3129163 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for
3129164 i believe that the international community is not looking to destabilize mauritania
3129165 when it has all the information it will turn in a positive direction
3129166 justice exists in mauritania and there is also a parliament which could be called on to judge them if necessary
3129167 i telephoned him abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
3129168 the changes of aug 6 the day of the coup are the logical and indisputable result of president sidi ould cheikh abdallahis behavior to stall the republics institutions
3129169 the period of one way ruble movement is finishing risks of opening long positions in the ruble have obviously grown
3129170 the situation in the economy is such that current account currency flows are now comparable with amounts transferred to the budget funds on average during a certain period
3129171 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
3129172 we shouldnt really stoop so low to wage wars against each other
3129173 as far as the hugging and kissing goes i do that with many friends i have many friends around the world and will always do that there should be no hatred among athletes and people
3129174 politicians should straighten out the situation today and if they dont well have to get involved
3129175 when it comes to sports we will always remain friends and nothing will affect our friendship even in such a scary event as shooting
3129176 we are friends indeed weve been shooting together for a long time she used to shoot for the soviet union we are really friends and dont get mixed up in political things sports is not politics
3129177 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
3129178 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
3129179 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
3129180 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
3129181 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
3129182 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3129183 theyre not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3129184 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3129185 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
3129186 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
3129187 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
3129188 i feel really good about the match not a lot of unforced errors no service breaks
3129189 i did the right things to come out on top
3129190 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3129191 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3129192 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
3129193 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
3129194 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
3129195 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
3129196 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
3129197 this related to the fact that many ministries including security related ones submitted proposals to significantly increase state spending
3129198 in order to balance the budget the finance ministry will propose to limit spending growth while staying within the existing tax burden
3129199 the court has confirmed the fact that robert dudley has committed a violation and has been fined
3129200 the rating watch negative reflects fitchs concern over continued deterioration in corporate governance resulting from the ongoing major shareholder conflict as well as its potential credit impact
3129201 the fires out and now were in the cool down period which usually takes some time
3129202 its still too hot to touch and we need it to cool before we can see what the damage is
3129203 has grown more intense and threatens to endanger the baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline the most prominent of several pipelines that crisscross the region
3129204 if the turks resume pipeline operations from their end it remains to be seen what will happen on the georgia side where continued fighting could easily imperil a restart and halt the flow of potentially 1 million barrels of oil a day
3129205 the main issue of the forum is to steadily turn into an organization
3129206 were not talking about a cartel this is not part of the picture
3129207 they are both going to play a lot and they are both going to play together at times because when we put them out there together it opens up a whole new challenge for defenses trying to stop us
3129208 with both of us out there you have no idea who is getting the ball and that makes us both more dangerous that is what made west virginia so good they had pat white steve slaton and noel devine back there thats a lot to deal with hopefully people will say the same thing about us
3129209 i feel like im here for whatever they need me for
3129210 im not going to whine about not getting enough playing time or anything like that
3129211 hes done so much for me helping me out with formations
3129212 hes like having a coach on the field if i have any questions i can go to him he knows the playbook like the quarterbacks
3129213 ive heard all during my career that im too small too light to do this or that on a football field
3129214 i told her how i felt told her i didnt think this playing fullback was a good idea
3129215 my mom said you stay there and you be the best fullback coming out of your class i said okay mom ill do what you tell me she said youve built a bond with your team you stay committed you do what they ask you to do ive been working hard ever since
3129216 the beer industry is now trying to find niches in the market
3129217 we had two kinds of beer piva nyet there is no beer and pivo yest there is beer
3129218 the market is open for new innovations and varieties the russian man likes to try new innovations and flavors
3129219 the development of new brands and new tastes of beer is one of the main trends of the market
3129220 makes sense because the beer market in russia is highly competitive companies need to maintain the loyalty of customers and win new ones and one way to do it is to introduce new products
3129221 the beer market is segmented by both price and functionality
3129222 you have the low end target consumers who are only price sensitive and on the other end you have a rising sophistication from consumers who seek value added qualities in what they purchase
3129223 consequently to satisfy the latters demands producers like baltika are offering spinoffs such as lite and brands that offer both taste and the look
3129224 we are trying to find added value in an already strong market
3129225 the companys task under strzhalkovsky is to act as a consolidation leader in the industry
3129226 we will also need the states help in international expansion and improving relations between shareholders
3129227 any large company should be interested in good relations with the government
3129228 a private company should be managed by a private businessman
3129229 potanin talked about the international projects after the board meeting which looks like absolute nonsense to me
3129230 he should first of all concentrate on the companys problems as the company is in crisis
3129231 people are fleeing the company en masse the production of all metals fell 8 to 11 percent last year and there are huge environmental problems in norilsk
3129232 i dont think rusals opposition to strzhalkovskys candidacy contradicts the governments interests
3129233 strzhalkovsky is a man fully affiliated with potanin he has known him since 2001
3129234 norilsk will only take part in the auction of udokan with a partner
3129235 i was the only board member to vote for norilsk nickels independent participation in the udokan tender
3129236 i think the company is perfectly competent to develop the project on its own
3129237 the groundbreaking experiment of the re store at nevsky prospekt 32 34 which does not share the premises with any other retailers will provide us with experience in whether such an approach is effective
3129238 russias northwest region traditionally ranks second place in computer software and hardware sales volumes
3129239 although market research and analysis are still in progress the targeted sales rates have been achieved and we are seeing almost the same demand for apple products as in moscow
3129240 were proud to report the best june quarter for both revenue and earnings in apples history
3129241 we set a new record for mac sales we think we have a real winner with our new iphone 3g and were busy finishing several more wonderful new products to launch in the coming months
3129242 looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we expect revenue of about 7 8 billion
3129243 the apple retail store on nevsky is a leader store which will mainly contribute to the companys image rather than to sales rates
3129244 we have chosen this street nevsky prospekt as it is the mainstream and fashionable route of the city yet at our store every customer is treated on an individual basis therefore the location should not be overcrowded
3129245 while the fighting continues we expect the market to remain under pressure as investors seek safer opportunities
3129246 the armed conflict with georgia has damaged investor confidence and a drawn out war would likely fuel the debate about political risk
3129247 the effect on the equity market will likely be seen in the higher equity risk premium associated with geopolitical tension
3129248 has serious long lasting negative implications for russian markets as it seems to be evolving into a major diplomatic standoff between major western countries and russia
3129249 the conflict raises political risks and deteriorates sentiment toward the russian market
3129250 this is a time for everyone with money to buy and for everyone with shares to hold tightly to them
3129251 im sure that within six to 12 months from now prices are going to be much higher than where they were today
3129252 the russian market has been punished excessively over the last couple of weeks
3129253 market sensitivities will again affect insurance operating results although to a lesser extent than in the first quarter
3129254 the transaction cost is extreme in that fully diluted sharecount will essentially double
3129255 under current financials markets pressures we believe that new buyers for xls stock were unlikely
3129256 is only running ahead of bushs 2004 result in four states
3129257 the key for obama is that he has held mccain to a one report setting a date for withdrawal will help preserve security gains in iraq
3129258 both parties have agreed on mutually agreeable terms to part company
3129259 it is an amicable arrangement and we appreciate and respect the issues that ruud has highlighted with the club and are very grateful for all the hard work he has contributed while with the organization hopefully he has laid the foundations for future success for the los angeles galaxy
3129260 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3129261 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the l a galaxy much success in the future i would now like to spend some time with my family before considering any other position in football
3129262 with ruud moving on we believe that this is the right time to make more sweeping changes throughout the organization
3129263 our commitment continues to be focused on not only winning the mls cup this and every season but to build a club capable of competing at the international level this decision is the right one for the organization the right one for the players and the right one for our fans we thank alexi for the tremendous hard work and dedication he brought to his job each and every day
3129264 wow this applies to a lot more than driving in fact it applies to just about everything in life

3129271 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche
3129272 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a
3129273 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

3129275 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3129276 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3129277 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3129278 there are hardly any events here that could be attended in a dior dress
3129279 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
3129280 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
3129281 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3129282 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3129283 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3129284 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3129285 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3129286 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3129287 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3129288 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3129289 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3129290 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3129291 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3129292 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3129293 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3129294 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3129295 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3129296 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3129297 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3129298 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3129299 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3129300 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3129301 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

3129306 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform that has indeed come to pass
3129307 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

3129312 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3129313 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3129314 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3129315 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

3129319 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3129320 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3129321 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3129322 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3129323 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3129324 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3129325 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale

3129337 thats probably the biggest reason im here because ive got that communication with truex for all these years now
3129338 obviously we miss gary and bono a whole bunch but the last three races weve been getting better and better and well go to michigan in good shape i think
3129339 man it was smooth the first time in a real long time that weve had a really smooth race in a while so hopefully that monkeys off our back
3129340 were not looking at points were just going out there and racing hard and well see where we end up when the racings over with
3129341 after making the announcement about signing a contract extension this past week and not having bono for the last couple all the guys have just stepped up taking over positions that they havent done before
3129342 ive said this before and it sounds so simple but just having the car prepared on time and having it through tech on time we ran around the glen all day beating and banging on the curbs and nothing fell off it
3129343 i just appreciate all of the guys who have stepped up mike did an incredible job all weekend of calling the race we worked on the car throughout practice when we unloaded we werent very good but we threw some things at it and it turned into a real good weekend
3129344 restarts here are very tough and everybodys really vulnerable because if the guy gets just a little bit of a run he can dive bomb you
3129345 i was really really loose on that first lap after that long red flag and i got loose down there in the carousel after the backstretch chicane i got out of the groove and montoya got back around me i said to the guys that it was probably a blessing in disguise because he was just a little bit better than me at the end anyhow and he deserved to beat us
3129346 i do like road racing i enjoy it a lot and sunday was really fun especially because the car was so good for a long time i was one of the fastest cars i was out there racing with ambrose and montoya and mixing it up with em we passed a lot of cars sunday i think montoya and ambrose were the only two cars that passed us all day so it was a really good day for us
3129347 ive always liked road racing and i was probably more comfortable coming here than i was going with the new car coil binding with the bump stops and stuff like that
3129348 we werent real good when we unloaded but we knew when we got done with saturdays practice that we were gonna be pretty good
3129349 we just pitted at the right time and the racecar was real good if you noticed you dont see a lot of passing here we run better on the longer runs and thats why on the last restart we were slipping and sliding a little but the more we run the better wed get
3129350 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3129351 when the powerade team came to me and said they wanted to run a race in the nationwide series i immediately wanted to run at homestead miami speedway
3129352 the track will always be special to me for a couple of reasons first of all i consider homestead miami my home track as miami is my home and its where my wife and i are raising our kids secondly i ran my first cup race at homestead miami in 2006 so its a place i will always remember in my nascar career
3129353 its quite a statement that juan pablo wants to run the nationwide series race here at homestead miami speedway
3129354 last year we had six of the top 12 chase sprint cup drivers competing in saturdays nationwide race and were expecting a similar field this november
3129355 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
3129356 xerox corporation carried out several studies on coaching they determined that in the absence of follow up coaching to their training classes 87 of the skills change brought about by the program was lost thats 87 cents on the skills dollar however good your skills training in the classroom unless its followed up on the job most of its effectiveness is lost without follow up coaching
3129357 over the past year the british biotech sector has witnessed a string of high profile drug failures share prices have plunged and there have been almost no public listings the sector is shrinking as private biotech companies are bought by cash rich pharmaceutical companies most of which are based abroad

3129361 ive been an oilman all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
3129362 because an energy policy needs to be left alone for fifteen or twenty years to take effect but our policymakers want a two year energy policy to fit with the electoral cycle
3129363 what we do in the next two or three years will define our future
3129364 i have maintained from the first descriptions of the material contained in the daschle letter that the quality appeared to be such that it could be produced only by some group that was involved with a current or former state program in recent years the level of knowledge expertise and experience required and the types of special equipment required to make such quality product takes time and experimentation to develop further the nature of the finished dried product is such that safety equipment and facilities must be used to protect the individuals involved and to shield their clandestine activity from discovery
3129365 you would need a chemist who is familiar with colloidal fumed silica and a material science person to put it all together and then some mechanical engineers to make this work probably some containment people if you dont want to kill anybody you need half a dozen i think really smart people
3129366 the statement should have had a reference an unsupported sentence being cited as fact is uncomfortable to me any statement in a scientific article should be supported by a reference or by documentation
3129367 what makes it even more impressive is the fact that its a summer film and its taking on all competitors and prevailing in such a profound way
3129368 the 40 million for us was just like wow we couldnt be happier

3129372 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3129373 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3129374 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3129375 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3129376 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3129377 whoever is saying that has no idea what is going on inside our campaign
3129378 senator obama has said consistently that if folks want to help this effort they should do so through our campaign
3129379 despite actively discouraging donors from giving to groups like progressive media at one point they are now taking the position that its nothing they have any control over
3129380 independent groups can talk to constituencies where the obama campaign or the dnc arent credible messengers the best example would be working america and its reach into white working class communities
3129381 there are some groups that are ready to make more donations working america votevets the choice groups and acorn to name a few otherwise it is almost too late to get a new ground group going a new advertising outfit could be put together by experienced independent campaigners in a few days the key is not to fund the grab ass efforts that are mostly a consultant hustle instead invest in really good work
3129382 i think that our interest is in controlling the message of our own campaign and in not allowing others to develop a message for us
3129383 so to the extent possible we would like people to give their donations to us so that we can use the money to deliver a message that is consistent with obamas desires

3129396 a joint enterprise is where all of those people involved in an incident such as a murder would all be held responsible for the outcome of that
3129397 we have seen the crown prosecution service take a very robust approach on this and they have secured convictions on quite a few cases particularly in respect of knife crime where people have been murdered
3129398 one person may have stabbed someone but all those present would have been charged with murder or manslaughter

3129449 they should know better because in the next round three teams blew a dive all they had to do was bounce back with a really good dive and they could have been back in the mix

3129468 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably

3129492 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3129493 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3129494 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3129495 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3129502 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3129503 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3129523 osu athletics receives no state funding so private support is critical to help oklahoma state student athletes compete at the highest levels
3129524 for us to achieve the ambitious goal of 10 000 posse members it is going to take a team effort we hope current members rally around this campaign and enlist and other family friends and alumni to help us continue to grow in this critical era of osu athletics no gift is too big or small for our student athletes participation is the key

3129602 leavenworth residents have been unknowingly walking around above an underground city and no one seems to know who created it or why windows doors and narrow paths beneath a title company at south fourth and delaware streets lead to storefronts stretching several city blocks and perhaps beyond
3129603 katy ryan is the editor for lv magazine and has been researching the mysteries below
3129604 you know you just think of the underground as such a dark spooky place but to think that this could have maybe been some kind of vibrant economic center is just kind of baffling really ryan said

3129610 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3129615 to establish such a chain claimants must demonstrate that the employee suffered an industrial injury that in turn caused a psychological injury severe enough to override rational judgment
3129616 the circumstances of this case are clear steve ramsey would not have committed suicide if not for his work place injuries there were no pre existing conditions that caused him to be susceptible or prone to suicide there were not intervening conditions or situations that occurred between the time of his work place injury and his death and steve ramsey continued to do all those things necessary to try and get well but for the injury at the wydak power plant steve ramsey would not have committed suicide

3129622 im not gonna vote for somebody just because theyre black if i vote it would be for a candidate that fights for our freedoms and exposes the lies and corruption and ron paul is the only person i see doing that he exposes things he says a lot of things i say in my rhymes dating back to the 90s its not about color or religion its about our freedoms
3129623 despite previously having called himself a proud supporter of the so called
3129624 if someone can sign a card and join the republican party they ought to be able to sign a card and join a union i am a proud supporter of the employee free choice act i support the right of workers to unionize anytime anywhere and i would fight for that if i was in congress anything i say to you right here ill go out there and say to them too
3129625 as a longtime friend of labor unions i must raise my voice against pending legislation i see as a disturbing and undemocratic overreach not in the interest of either management or labor under efca workers could lose the freedom to express their will in private the right to make a decision without anyone peering over their shoulder free from fear of reprisal

3129629 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
3129630 john edwards is an extraordinary human being who made an egregious error i feel sad because i know john edwards so well in life we all make mistakes it breaks my heart if this is going to disqualify him from being a public servant because he would be a great one
3129631 the 20 page memo instructed these mostly elderly workers never to testify that they saw warning labels on asbestos packages or knew it was dangerous and gave firm directions on how to testify about their exposure to asbestos products in ways to make their cases better
3129632 here in georgia interviewing the president even at 11 pm is standard we do not come to the office early we do not return home until late
3129633 they do not believe we act on our own making our own free choice
3129634 you can imagine what horrible consequences there would be if we followed their political and economic model
3129635 they need a rationale for responding with the full weight of the far superior russian military

3129644 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
3129645 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem

3129653 people taking staycations are not necessarily entertaining themselves at home
3129654 on the contrary many are participating in travel related activities that generate significant revenues for restaurants attractions theme parks as well as hotels and resorts
3129655 although staycations appear to be a real phenomenon the results of this survey suggest that their potential negative impact on the domestic travel industry will be far less than expected based on the extensive coverage this phenomenon has received in the press

3129658 travel agents just need the right tools to profit from this growing market segment our web site provides the tools
3129659 faas claim that it can use its property management authority to auction slots is intellectually dishonest and a disturbing end run around congress
3129660 every transportation administration except this one has acknowledged that it does not have the authority to implement auctions and other so called market mechanisms yet this administration believes it can ignore the statutory limits of its authority to remake the industry as it sees fit

3129667 ich h tte am liebsten die ganze mannschaft mitgenommen in den zwei monaten hatte sich eine beziehung aufgebaut am vergangenen donnerstag ging es los die spieler im trainingscamp wurden immer ngstlicher und wir verfolgten permanent im internet die entwicklung
3129668 noch nie war ich so froh ber die handy verbindung ber die ich meine familie in braunschweig auf dem laufenden hielt und beruhigte
3129669 dort lag ein etwas benommener pfau im garten verletzungen waren aber nicht sichtbar

3129671 der pfau ist ein ganz friedliches tier ber die terrasse kam er zu uns sogar bis ins wohnzimmer und lie sich f ttern
3129672 i firmly object to all buy america restrictions as they represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy
3129673 from a philosophical point of view i oppose such policies because free trade is an important element in improving relations among all nations which then improves the security of our nation furthermore as a fiscal conservative i want to ensure our government gets the best deal for taxpayers and with a buy american restriction that cannot be guaranteed

3129684 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3129685 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3129686 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3129697 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3129698 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3129699 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3129700 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3129701 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3129702 there is broad agreement in the u n security council on this and were working with others to get a draft resolution introduced as soon as possible
3129703 that russia is overreaching by the intensification of its war and by the goals that it might be embracing with regard to this conflict
3129704 this will have a lasting impact on russias relations and standing with the united states and others in the international community
3129705 also we want to make sure our russian colleagues understand that the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe are gone
3129706 there is a serious issue and of course the united states feels i think very vulnerable in a way on that issue because there has been a heavy u s involvement in the georgian affairs in the past few years
3129707 it is possible that poor weather conditions particularly in central and eastern canada magnified the decline in construction
3129708 watsa is by nature an investment professional not necessarily an insurance professional
3129709 he looks for either misunderstood or beaten down stocks or securities and that philosophy is carried through both in his investment process as well as the way he has built his insurance company
3129710 deep value investor never been an activist shareholder and has generally been contrarian in their investor views
3129711 they bought credit default swaps on countrywide and radiant and they foresaw a lot of this credit crunch that were in right now so theyve been excellent long term deep valued investors and theyve hit it out of the park as of late
3129712 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3129713 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3129714 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3129715 we worked so hard previously to pass a good bill
3129716 one that would require the use of english in boards commissions and council meetings when the mayor vetoed it people kind of felt like their voices were thwarted
3129717 we were very disappointed this is being brought up again
3129718 nashville is such a cool city such an inclusive city such a welcoming city
3129719 i keep thinking that each one of these accidents is going to be the tipping point to spur progress in washington
3129720 we continue to see an urgent need for safety improvements in the industry
3129721 those that can afford to fly are afforded a certain level of safety while those who use buses are dependent on a system that is far less strict
3129722 there is no question that the number one safety device the one that has saved the most lives since its installation is the seatbelt
3129723 since then the study has been collecting dust despite being on the most wanted list of the ntsb for years
3129724 the triad is the most advanced frame weve ever made for multiport athletes
3129725 the triads design was perfected in the wind tunnel the free wind tunnel time will enable the riders to optimize their relationship with the new bike the same way we perfected its design by awarding our very best product to leading amateur triathletes we seek to reward their commitment and talent as we enhance our support of the sport
3129726 weve seen an increased demand from our customers for training gear that can take them through changeable weather conditions and the winter months
3129727 the nature of triathlon also means many of our customers are involved in other sports as well and with our new winter training range were giving people the ability to wear orca in other parts of their lives
3129728 the team at orca ranges from enthusiastic beginners right up to world champions and one thing we all know is that the equipment you train in is just as important as your race gear
3129729 so in developing the new winter training collection weve ensured the garments meet the same strict performance measures we apply to our triathlon apparel and wetsuits plus they have to have the distinctive orca styling weve become known for
3129730 i had such an ideal practice i was working on horses half the time and humans half the time it was a perfect mix
3129731 they insisted that as a licensed massage therapist i could only massage humans and that in order to massage animals i had to be a veterinarian
3129732 veterinarians have no training in massage therapy its not taught at vet school and they dont have time to do it anyway
3129733 i never in my wildest dreams expected to be doing this but nobody had this had been going on for awhile and it was time for someone to say no this isnt right

3129737 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3129738 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3129739 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3129740 he miscalculated he did not expect that moscow would rap his knuckles he thought it would just stick to rhetoric

3129757 as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
3129758 we honor the principle that a current spouse has no obligation to support someone elses child while accounting for the reality that the current spouse may provide economic resources to the household
3129759 the problem is new jersey does not give same sex couples like jim and mark odonnell the freedom to marry and to be legally equal spouses
3129760 when the law gives a couple responsibilities without equality the law must be changed

3129763 what will you be doing in south america study work
3129764 yes that is certainly true but what is even more important is that the journey is only the reward when this journey is stony and bumpy and winding and potholed a dirty path a difficult one that needs to be mastered
3129765 come on guys its my birthday and its time to eat
3129766 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
3129767 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
3129768 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
3129769 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3129770 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
3129771 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
3129772 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
3129773 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
3129774 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
3129775 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days

3129783 to provide the best care for residents and to remain a solvent business there are limits on the number of medicaid residents any assisted living facility can serve
3129784 this lady is probably 80 pounds you could pick her up with one hand you could put your fingers around her wrist she is just a little little little teeny frail frail person she smiles and shes always happy but she dont know whats going on
3129785 it was her money and she is now broke i mean she has zero money
3129786 she said to me marilou did i do something wrong
3129787 i just thought it was so sad that someone of that age would look at me and be so upset and think the only reason that they would be telling me to leave would be because i broke the rules or i did something wrong
3129788 people of that generation theyre very much about following the rules and theyre also very much about keeping their promises
3129789 new corporate policy which is all over their web site which is that they want to get rid of medicaid patients entirely and become purely private pay

3129797 she confirmed that we would not take any action and that the 45 day notification period is a minimum and not a deadline
3129798 we are waiting we want to see this verification regime
3129799 it is a minimum 45 day period and as of yet we dont have that verification regime
3129800 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
3129801 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
3129802 the appetite is tremendous in colorado alone we have 80 000 requests for about 75 000 tickets
3129803 there is no question that we will fill that stadium
3129804 im pleased that procurve is trying to add additional components to the product side
3129805 when youre talking wireless its definitely in every conversation were having today
3129806 being a procurve partner and presenting a procurve solution and you dont have 11n youre dead in the water
3129807 its a technology space we felt we needed to own
3129808 we will be creating demand for them and giving them a broader set of solutions
3129809 this will definitely be a great move and a great way for us to have a strong wireless offering without just key components
3129810 this is a great segue to get into new markets with them
3129811 i think procurve was heading in this direction already and this helps them leapfrog to where they were going
3129812 this acquisition is going to speed this up for procurve and for me
3129813 i expect procurve will take this product line and add in the wire line security components that other wireless vendors are missing
3129814 we will look at the opportunities out there in the market and understand how it impacts our customers
3129815 from monday through thursday our convention program will highlight the people of this country who want positive change and who believe barack obama is the leader who will listen to their concerns and get our country moving in the right direction again

3129823 working in a series creates a remarkable inexplicable dialogue with the paintings
3129824 with each one i see more and understand more deeply
3129825 my minds eye shows me things not that the images turn out like that but my minds eye works on the problem on the idea so its a combination of an idea and a feeling and the color will describe it
3129826 i work up the idea in drawings large and small so that i can see if there are problems and make changes
3129827 when i first started using masking fluid 20 years ago i used brushes to apply it
3129828 then i used eye droppers turkey basters medicine droppers now i often use a masquepen in which the masking fluid comes out in a fine continuous line
3129829 the older i get and the more experienced the more aware i am of the possible ways of solving painting problems it would not be interesting to paint if it were all prescribed watercolor is difficult but it depends on how you approach it for me when something isnt working i put it aside for a while
3129830 when i first did big pieces i had to tape them down and this created a border
3129831 that border is like a frame for the past seven or eight years ive wanted to make my colors more significant if everything is a brilliant red there is nothing to bounce off of it so to make my colors glow i used more secondary colors and more water i started to build the zones into the center utilizing the entire surface the process liberated me from the way i was working before i stopped using gouache as the final layer to me this became another way to articulate my deep feelings and reverence for nature to express the joy of it
3129832 and i guess that some of the feel for line and shape as well as the clean finish have come from that world
3129833 and the streets of amsterdam were bare of leaves so that you could see the bones of the buildings the whole city was in silhouette and the light was amazing
3129834 when i was traveling in europe i noticed a lot of heavily printed wallpapers with outsized patterns
3129835 i added those to the images to convey a sense of the whole experience
3129836 but i dont think too much about the atmosphere of the work even though it is important to me i feel that will emerge as a byproduct of the choices i make while doing the painting
3129837 at this stage im just establishing the skeleton of the piece
3129838 i vary the proportion of casein to acrylic as i work
3129839 i use more casein in the light colored areas where i really build up the paint to heavier layers
3129840 i admire edward hopper for his sense of light and space
3129841 even when he doesnt have figures in his paintings you feel that they are about people you often have the sense that someone has just left the picture or that some sort of story is taking place in the houses he paints
3129842 i was attracted to the program because of the wide range of media i was able to work in
3129843 but most of my electives were in the fine art area
3129844 cuomo sent letters to jpmorgan morgan stanley and wachovia telling them that his office is reviewing the banks behavior in the sale of auction rate securities
3129845 he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness
3129846 father forgive them for they know not what they do
3129847 i wanted to have some original art on my walls
3129848 it gives an avenue for the viewer to participate in the creative venture with you i like to provide an element of mystery or intrigue so people will look at the painting more than once and ask whats that i want them to revisit and become involved
3129849 its hard to pin down the process of an experimental painter
3129850 its my painting i do what i want to do but i try to do new things and experiment to keep fresh my process varies from painting to painting each painting eventually takes on a new life
3129851 they teach themselves to paint with the tools i give them i give them the chance to learn and explore i teach a technique but students must be willing to take a risk and to make it their own i also inspire them to have confidence in themselves i tap into their creative spirits and motivate their own authentic voices i want them to leave excited about painting and knowing they can do it if they work hard enough
3129852 sandy had worked in oil painting for many years and we wanted to try something that we could do together
3129853 not believing in starting small the first piece we attempted was a 45
3129854 despite the challenges once we were done we knew we had found something that we both loved and could work on together
3129855 i like to use different colored grouts depending on the design because there isnt one color that looks right with everything
3129856 most of our fine art projects have an average of 1 600 individually shaped pieces of glass per square foot
3129857 not because its not safe but because we cant do very much work at the moment
3129858 es lo mismo que la noche anterior no es en el centro y lo nico que buscan es crear miedo
3129859 r i p elvis but man you made some lousy movies
3129860 because this year is an odd number anniversary and a gallon of gas costs more than a necklace made of unicorn horns im not driving to memphis this week to stand around in the august heat with my fellow weirdos
3129861 instead i rented a stack of elvis movies last weekend and paid tribute to the king with a full day of electrifying elvis cinema
3129862 the dark haired elvis stars as an air force officer named josh whos ordered to smooth talk his opossum eating tennessee cousins out of their property because the military wants to use it as a base for nuclear missiles elvis also plays joshs mountain dwelling cousin jodie a blond haired lug with a waxy complexion who may be a hillbilly golem lets just say its not as convincing as jeremy irons playing identical twins in dead ringers

3129874 myself and all of my classmates squirmed and strained ourselves to come up with an answer to her question
3129875 common sense but it was so compelling that it stuck in my mind to this day i regularly ask myself when writing am i just trying to force interest on an uninteresting idea or do i really have something to say so the question is

3129890 some women get so obsessed with keeping their weight in check while pregnant that they go overboard on dieting and exercise and put their babys health at some risk experts say
3129891 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well its not unusual to see pictures of these celebrities the day before and the day after birth and theyre looking super humanly fit theyre really incredible
3129892 but you also have to remember a lot of these celebrities are just genetically blessed
3129893 they have the best dietitians nutritionists trainers etc they certainly have an advantage

3129896 the second quarter was highlighted by progress in the ramp up and expansion of our solar grade silicon production and shipments as we advance towards our planned nominal annual capacity of 14 400 metric tons
3129897 as anticipated we encountered a number of production challenges that are typical during the start up periods for complex industrial processes which impacted our output of solar grade silicon for the quarter purity of our material is paramount as we continuously refine our facilities in meeting our customers specifications based on our experience to date with the three new production lines commissioned earlier this year and process improvements that we plan to implement as we expand our solar grade silicon production capacity we have targeted output in the range of 1 200 to 1 500 metric tons for the current year
3129898 the non cash intangible asset charge that we recognized this quarter stems from the 2002 acquisition of conestoga enterprises inc including two of its rural local exchange carriers conestoga telephone and buffalo valley telephone
3129899 a portion of the purchase price was allocated at that time to the indefinite lived franchise intangible asset this asset reflects the value of estimated future cash flows from providing communication services to customers who move into these territories subsequent to the acquisition based on our most recent estimates of the regulated future cash flows from these customers we have determined that the value of the franchise intangible asset needed to be reduced this is a non cash charge and has no impact on our cash flow generated from operations excluding the franchise intangible asset charge and the reduction to wireline depreciation expense net income for the quarter increased approximately 7 over the second quarter of 2007 d amp e remains focused on broadband on net clec business and improvement in systems integration performance
3129900 systems integration continues on its improvement path operating income for the quarter was 8 000 compared to an operating loss of approximately 0 4 million in the second quarter of 2007 the fact that systems integration posted a quarter of operating income even though it was a modest amount demonstrates that the steps weve taken and the focus on execution in this segment are having a positive impact the 1 2 million improvement in operating income for the six months year to date in fiscal year 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 is further proof of their impact
3129901 we look forward to opening our first store in georgia and serving the atlanta area
3129902 i enjoy seeing the reaction of our customers when they first enter our stores smell the leather and see the incredible array of products when i see that positive reaction i know that we have achieved our goal of creating an outstanding retail shopping experience for avid equestrians
3129903 we are pleased to have taken delivery of m v tupi maiden which increases our operating fleet to 45 vessels this delivery further enhances our ability to generate revenues and stable cash flows while implementing our strategy of growing our fleet in response to the growth of our business
3129904 purio has operated the down scaled model of our patented technology using a variety of water samples and that exercise has proven the units ability to produce fresh clear safe drinking water from contaminated and unsafe sources our next step is to prove the results in a recognized and accepted format which is only possible through an independent recognized lab
3129905 as a further demonstration of the units ability around mid week we are preparing to move the unit to a new location at a shallow lake near a recreational resort village to show the transportability of the unit and its ability to produce safe water from a variety of sources
3129906 we will also be ordering and reporting on a complete battery of lab analysis on that operation as well
3129907 because our technology clarifies water without the use of membranes we have captured the attention of interested parties from around the world some have admitted their skepticism that they dont believe that our claims are possible through our operations and testing through this week and the following accredited lab reports we intend to make believers out of even the most discriminating observers the economical processing methods we use may open doors of possibilities for thirsty communities and companies around the world who simply wont accept unsafe drinking water any longer
3129908 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired

3129911 but it is almost physically impossible to get it passed and implemented in time
3129912 although universals earnings in the current quarter were less than last years level the company continued to generate profitable results during the second quarter of 2008 despite heightened competition and decreased premium rates as a result of the continued profitability the company strengthened its balance sheet with an increase in stockholders equity and announced a 3 0 million stock buyback plan on june 25
3129913 the company remains committed to its growth plan and we are pleased to have been recently admitted to write property and casualty insurance in south carolina furthermore we are optimistic that we will receive our licenses for texas hawaii georgia and north carolina over the next six months
3129914 we are very pleased with our financial results for the quarter including the significant increase in our royalty revenues and the reduction in total costs and expenses which reflects the impact of our recent asset sales and ongoing restructuring activities as we continue to reduce our cost structure
3129915 as we prepare for the spin off of our biotechnology assets for which we intend to file key regulatory documents shortly we continue to have an active parallel process underway to evaluate various options for the monetization of our royalty stream
3129916 i am pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of 2008 which were driven by the high fleet utilization levels we attained for yet another quarter
3129917 in the span of 16 months since going public we have grown oceanfreight from a fleet of seven bulk carriers to a fleet of twelve vessels comprised of nine bulk carriers and three crude oil tankers while maintaining a prudent leverage structure we have declared five consecutive quarterly dividends totaling 3 21 per share we believe that our high time charter coverage will enable us to continue to pay quarterly dividends consistent with our dividend policy our annualized dividend yield based on the closing price of 17 36 on august 8th stands at 18 currently we have fixed under time charter employment 97 of our remaining operating days in 2008 94 in 2009 and 60 in 2010 basis mid point redeliveries the average remaining duration of our contracts is approximately 2 3 years which translates into significant visibility and predictability we remain committed to our stated business strategy since we went public of seeking opportunities to grow and diversify our fleet within multiple shipping sectors while we aim to deliver consistent returns to our shareholders

3129919 vicor continues to be strategically well positioned despite worldwide economic uncertainty as anticipated due to booking trends in q1 and early q2 vicors revenue for the second quarter declined as the global economy softened revenue from our brick business unit experienced a roughly six percent decline sequentially however bookings in july including a first 3 2 million order for v i chip inside vibricks came in 35 ahead of april levels pointing to improving demand for our expanding brick product line also despite the decline in q2 revenue the brick units gross margin as a percentage of revenue actually increased from the q1 level
3129920 as previously discussed anticipated volume shipments of a major v i chip program were pushed out early this year as such revenue for v i chip declined roughly 27 from the prior quarter we had planned higher levels of v i chips shipments in q2 but now forecast ramping in q3 and q4 because we had put infrastructure in place to meet greater demand v i chip continues to absorb the costs of underutilized production capacity accordingly v i chip generated a higher operating loss for the quarter we remain confident v i chip will essentially double its top line in 2008 experience robust growth in 2009 and improve its gross margin with economies of scale our confidence is based on progress being made with early adopters and the ongoing expansion of relationships with licensees and partners bringing about a global presence and facilitating adoption of v i chips and factorized power
3129921 picor our fabless semiconductor unit recently announced its first family of cool oring power path management products addressing the requirements of redundant power architectures for high availability systems such as high end computing telecom communication and wireless infrastructure cool oring power management products reduce power dissipation eliminate the need for costly thermal management and reduce board level real estate versus conventional active oring solutions the introduction of this product family is a significant first step in picors synergistic product roadmap
3129922 of course we are disappointed to have experienced a net loss for the second quarter however temporarily high r amp d expenses applications engineering and marketing expenses and the margin drag caused by underutilized capacity represent appropriate investments in the development of our products and markets as discussed last quarter we expect overall revenue growth may remain modest until the first half of 2009 however early adopters have embraced our ability to address their power needs with high performance power components as building blocks of efficient power distribution and power systems vicor is well capitalized and with our brick business model and the momentum we are seeing in disruptive technology products pioneered by v i chip and picor well positioned for the future
3129923 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
3129924 we are very pleased to announce our first results and to declare our first dividend as a public company
3129925 during the second quarter 2008 our net income increased by 28 compared to the same period of 2007 reflecting both higher charter rates and a larger fleet size
3129926 we have benefited from a balanced chartering policy which provides us with a high level of contracted base cash flow but at the same time allows us to benefit from a continued strong market
3129927 we have taken advantage of our strong financial position to contract for the acquisition of a high quality newbuild post panamax class vessel this vessel acquisition which we announced in july 2008 will increase our fleet to 20 vessels after the delivery of all contracted newbuilds by the second half of 2010 given our young and modern fleet our strong cash flow generation and high time charter coverage we are confident that we will be able to meet our objectives to profitably grow our business and to increase our distributable cash flow per share in the coming years
3129928 the excitement is high practice has been great so far and im happy with the commitment of our players
3129929 there is a lot of potential on this team and these guys are hungry
3129930 what has been done in the past is definitely the direction of the future
3129931 we will work to concentrate improve on consistency and learn the expectations of each other
3129932 we want a guy who can lead manage the team and facilitate the offense
3129933 we have a lot of energy and are lightyears ahead of where we were this spring
3129934 defensively we will have to develop depth play physically up front and stop the run
3129935 usually there are exciting players on special teams we want those players to make game changing plays
3129936 the complexity of setting up mobile applications on many phones is a great obstacle for most people so weve worked hard to make bluewhalemail childs play to setup
3129937 in a revolutionary approach to deploying mobile applications weve also launched a facebook web application to help with setup
3129938 were trying to make social networking as much a part of mobile life as text messaging
3129939 with its unique combination of email and facebook our service is the simplest choice for those wishing to stay on top of their social life while theyre away from their computer
3129940 not surprising the phones that made our top 10 list include feature specific models geared towards the next generation of cell phone users with easy sms text capabilities cameras music games cool colors and of course new and improved batteries for longer talk time
3129941 however at the same time these devices are all still affordable typically it is the parents not the students who are purchasing the devices they want to stay connected to their children but in the current economic environment the phones cannot cost a fortune

3129960 but in a presidential year filled with firsts african american nominee serious woman candidate former pow to be his partys standard bearer lieberman retains the intriguing potential to become the first jewish party crossing second time around vice presidential nominee in american history while mccain is keeping his vice presidential deliberations intensely private it is not hard to pick up republican whispers that the wild card lieberman speculation is grounded in reality rather than water cooler fantasy
