2510004 if there were things the war has taught me those are to stop dwelling in the past and to never burden the heart with guilt when we know we couldnt do anything to change something thats over
2510005 instead we should start doing things the right way without the self loathing in our hearts so we can look forward to a bright future

2510016 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2510017 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2510018 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2510019 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2510020 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time

2510026 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2510027 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2510029 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2510030 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2510031 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2510032 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2510033 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2510034 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2510040 when people ask if this is the right time to be starting a business from home my response is most definitely yes not only do you start earning your own income but as these results show youll also be profiting from the rise in value of your house and saving on fuel costs by keeping off the road for anyone thinking of turning the spare room cellar or attic into an office this will surely offer yet more reasons as to why they should
2510041 our figures show you can save 8 40 per day by working from home that adds up to more than 2 000 per year and if you can do without a second car that leads to annual savings of in excess of 6 000 these are cost savings that any family would be pleased to see what we like to see is that not only are homeworkers saving costs they are also saving the environment

2510064 then i stood on the sand of the sea and i saw a beast rising up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and on the horns ten crowns and on his heads a blasphemous name
2510065 now the beast which i saw was like a leopard his feet were like the feet of a bear and his mouth like the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power his throne and great authority which the roman catholic church still holds today at least in their opinion i saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded and his deadly wound was healed and all the world marveled and followed the beast so they worshipped the dragon who gave authority to the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like the beast who is able to make war with him and he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemes and he was given authority to continue for 42 months
2510066 i watched them because of the sound of the pompous words which the horn was speaking i watched till the beast was slain and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame
2510067 he shall speak pompous words against the most high shall persecute the saints of the most high and shall attempt to change times and law
2510068 the king shall do according to his own will he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god shall speak blasphemies against the god of gods he shall regard neither the god of his fathers nor the desire of women
2510069 then he the beast opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name his tabernacle and those who dwell in heaven and it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and authority was given him over every tribe tongue and nation
2510070 and all who dwell on the earth will worship him whose names have not been written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world

2510096 not a chance buddy remember what they think about you you cant have any of those things they told you so
2510097 i might try listen to a few of his tracks
2510098 now there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews this man came to him by night and said to him rabbi we know that you have come from god as a teacher for no one can do these signs that you do unless god is with him
2510099 behold all souls are mine the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine the soul who sins will die
2510100 and you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world
2510101 even when we were dead in our transgressions god made us alive together with christ by grace you have been saved
2510102 what then are we better than they not at all for we have already charged that both jews and greeks are all under sin as it is written there is none righteous not even one there is none who understands there is none who seeks for god all have turned aside together they have become useless there is none who does good there is not even one there is no fear of god before their eyes
2510103 and in him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of christ having been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised up with him through faith in the working of god who raised him from the dead and when you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh he made you alive together with him having forgiven us all our transgressions
2510104 for i will take you from the nations gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land then i will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean i will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols moreover i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you and i will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances
2510105 there was the true light which coming into the world enlightens every man he was in the world and the world was made through him and the world did not know him he came to his own and those who were his own did not receive him but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
2510106 i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion so then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs but on god who has mercy
2510107 for he is not a jew who is one outwardly neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew who is one inwardly and circumcision is that which is of the heart by the spirit not by the letter of the law and his praise is not from men but from god
2510108 for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
2510109 and she will bear a son and you shall call his name jesus for it is he who will save his people from their sins
2510110 though the number of the sons of israel be as the sand of the sea it is the remnant that will be saved
2510111 enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and many are those who enter by it for the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life and few are those who find it
2510112 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not as a result of works that no one should boast
2510113 but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name
2510114 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
2510115 be diligent to present yourself approved to god as a workman who does not need to be ashamed handling accurately the word of truth
2510116 and this is his commandment that we believe in the name of his son jesus christ and love one another just as he commanded us and the one who keeps his commandments abides in him and he in him
2510117 the multitude said therefore to him what shall we do that we may work the works of god
2510118 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless before him in love he predestined us to adoption as sons through jesus christ to himself according to the kind intention of his will
2510119 you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you
2510120 you can be born again simply by praying and asking jesus christ to work a miracle in your life you can do it at this very moment it is your hearts attitude that counts we suggest the following prayer that may guide you
2510121 the heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick who can understand it
2510122 moreover i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you and i will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you will be careful to observe my ordinances
2510123 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god being justified as a gift by his grace through the redemption which is in christ jesus that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in jesus where then is boasting it is excluded by what kind of law of works no but by a law of faith for we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law
2510124 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not as a result of works that no one should boast
2510125 so faith comes from hearing and hearing by the word of christ
2510126 seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return to the lord and he will have compassion on him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon
2510127 the lord is gracious and merciful slow to anger and great in lovingkindness the lord is good to all and his mercies are over all his works all thy works shall give thanks to thee o lord and thy godly ones shall bless thee they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men thy mighty acts and the glory of the majesty of thy kingdom thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endures throughout all generations
2510128 the lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit
2510129 but to this one i will look to him who is humble and contrite of spirit and who trembles at my word
2510130 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise
2510131 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined to me and heard my cry he brought me up out of the pit of destruction out of the miry clay and he set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm and he put a new song in my mouth a song of praise to our god many will see and fear and will trust in the lord how blessed is the man who has made the lord his trust and has not turned to the proud nor to those who lapse into falsehood
2510132 therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance god is now declaring to men that all everywhere should repent because he has fixed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness through a man whom he has appointed having furnished proof to all men by raising him from the dead
2510133 the sabbath was made for man not man for the sabbath

2510138 truly i say to you as you did not do it to one of the least of these you did not do it to me

2510160 i have a strong suspicion that were going to find out that this person is mentally ill id imagine with schizophrenia
2510161 btw i have my own mental health issues i am not concerned by speculation this person has something seriously wrong with them that would be a comfort that this person or others like him could be detected by family friends or coworkers and receive treatment this is different from the converse e g viewing the mentally ill with fear or suspicion as potential violent criminals the alternative that this is simply random evil it could happen on a park bench in your school at the mall or that evil people simply exist and nothing can be done about it is the more frightening
2510162 it seems like the best lesson that can be taken from this is about how recognizing and treating mental illness is extremely important its great how much positive treatment the victims are getting thats something that probably wouldnt happen in the us after a quick counseling session people would be on their own

2510229 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend
2510230 i am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics but i think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music
2510231 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2510232 a lot of times artists like ludacris they push the envelope in terms of describing the contradictions of american society
2510233 all indications show the 2008 election will probably have the largest youth voter turnout the largest hip hop voter turnout in u s history

2510238 it was neither this man nor his parents who sinned but that the works of god might be manifested in him it is necessary for us to work the works of the one who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one is able to work
2510239 the blindness is not due to human sin but it exists to heighten the glory of gods acts e g exod 7 3 5 john 11 4 given this purpose jesus needs to do the works of god
2510240 it was neither this man nor his parents who sinned but in order that the works of god might be made manifest in him it is necessary for us to work the works of the one who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one is able to work
2510241 due to human sin but no other explanation for it is given
2510242 let the works of god be made manifest in him
2510243 the chief reason for hesitating to adopt this rendering is the comparable thought in 11 4
2510244 he does not say a single work but uses the plural number works for so long as he was blind there was exhibited in him a proof of the severity of god from which others might learn to fear and to humble themselves it was afterwards followed by the benefit of his cure and deliverance in which the astonishing goodness of god was strikingly displayed
2510245 jesus was asked about the cause of the mans blindness but he answers in terms of its purpose
2510246 we must work the works of him who sent me
2510247 then they said to him what must we do to be doing the works of god
2510248 jesus mode of existence in the world is not that of god or of the ascended son of man but that of a human being whose day would end in the darkness of night in which no one can work
2510249 now jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book but these are written so that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name
2510250 him was life and the life was the light of men the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it
2510251 the sun shall be no more your light by day nor for brightness shall the moon give you light but the lord will be your everlasting light and your god will be your glory
2510252 this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all
2510253 and night will be no more they will need no light of lamp or sun for the lord god will be their light and they will reign forever and ever
2510254 in that day the branch of the lord shall be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and honor of the survivors of will be called holy everyone who has been recorded for life in from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning then the lord will create over the whole site of mount zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night for over all the glory there will be a canopy
2510255 i am the lord i have called you in righteousness i will take you by the hand and keep you i will give you as a covenant for the people a light for the nations to open the eyes that are blind to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon from the prison those who sit in darkness i am the lord that is my name my glory i give to no other nor my praise to carved idols behold the former things have come to pass and new things i now declare before they spring forth i tell you of them
2510256 we will not hide them from their children but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord and his might and the wonders that he has done he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children that the next generation might know them the children yet unborn and arise and tell them to their children so that they should set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments
2510257 the lord has brought about our vindication come let us declare in the work of the lord our god
2510258 then they cried to the lord in their trouble and he delivered them from their distress he sent out his word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction
2510259 the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali the way of the sea beyond the jordan galilee of the gentiles the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death on them a light has dawned
2510260 lord now you are letting your servant depart in peace according to your word for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples a light for revelation to the gentiles and for glory to your people jesus came to reveal the father to the world through healing being a light and doing the work of the father
2510261 idea of the preexistence of the soul and concomitant possibility of sinning before birth or of the transmigration of souls from an earlier existence is certainly not present here though under alien influences such notions played a role in judaism after the time of jesus

2510281 its no longer something special that you do only with the chosen few
2510282 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2510283 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2510284 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2510285 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2510286 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
2510287 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2510288 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming

2510305 this is a parish that does exactly what the holy father tells us to do celebrating the mass reverently in the old and new forms the bishop is determined to squash it and to destroy me because he doesnt want me moving to another parish and doing the same thing
2510306 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people

2510332 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2510333 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2510334 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2510335 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time

2510369 protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens no matter where they are located
2510370 in any case the time to deal with this conflict is not now but was two or even four years ago for a very long time it has been clear that there was a security vacuum in the caucasus that this vacuum was dangerous that war was likely that georgia an eager ally of the united states would not emerge well from a confrontation and that a successful invasion of georgia a country with u s troops on its soil would reflect badly on the west cowardice weakness lack of ideas and above all the distraction of other events prevented any deeper engagement and now it may be too late
2510371 the principles at stake including sovereignty and territorial integrity apply well beyond the caucasus to abandon georgia and its fragile democratic rose revolution would send a terrible signal to other former soviet and warsaw pact republics that to moscows dismay have achieved or are working toward democracy and fully independent foreign policies the west has made that sort of mistake before and must not do so again

2510616 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2510617 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2510618 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2510619 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2510620 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2510621 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2510622 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2510623 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2510624 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2510625 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2510626 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2510627 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2510628 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2510629 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2510630 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2510631 i should have known that people would feel that way
2510632 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2510633 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2510634 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2510635 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2510636 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids

2510639 basically were naming everything girls like in a song so when you hear it youll understand exactly what im talking about if you dont know what girls like then im going to tell you in this song im going to let you know exactly what they like just give you a couple points its going to help you with the entire rest of your life thats what its going to help you with for sure
2510640 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2510641 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2510642 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2510643 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2510644 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2510645 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2510646 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2510647 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2510648 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2510649 only one of us could make it over the wall

2510651 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2510652 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2510653 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2510654 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2510655 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2510656 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2510657 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2510658 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2510659 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2510660 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2510661 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2510662 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2510663 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2510664 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2510665 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2510666 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie
2510667 its a new age young hip hop version of heat
2510668 these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris be the little homey
2510669 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2510670 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2510671 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2510672 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2510673 i got two records with t pain that are retarded
2510674 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2510675 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2510676 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2510677 comparing observations with results from computer models improves our understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
2510678 one of the most serious challenges that humanity will face in response to climate change is adapting to changes in extreme weather events there is a major concern that heavy rainstorms will become more common and more intense in a warmer climate floods can completely devastate areas and peoples livelihoods and so this knowledge could have massive implications on how we plan for our changing climate in the future
2510679 a surprising result is that the models appear to underestimate the increase in intensity of the heaviest rain events to warming this suggests that model projections of future changes in rainfall extremes due to human caused global warming may also be underestimated
2510680 the cblp is one of our flagship programmes long established and hugely successful in the european market
2510681 our research tells us that there is demand for open programmes in asia our alumni have been telling us that they and their organisations want to be able to attend open executive programmes in the region
2510682 from day one we have said that we will only submit a planning application if we can design a wind turbine development that is appropriate for the location
2510683 the decision to submit a planning application for a monitoring mast illustrates our commitment to gaining a detailed understanding of the local environment before progressing to a planning application
2510684 we remain committed to fully engaging with the local community and we are in the early stage of preparing for some consultation events in the local area the dates and locations of these events will be agreed with the local parish councils and announced in the near future
2510685 employers tell us that if we are to meet our ambitious aims to expand the number of apprenticeships we need to cut the red tape around the programme
2510686 there is no reason why firms should have to deal with multiple copies of time consuming paperwork provide the same information to several different agencies be expected to invoice government more often than is necessary or have to undergo complex inspection requirements when they already have perfectly adequate systems of their own
2510687 the practical measures we have agreed will enable more employers to meet their present and future skills needs unimpeded by time consuming administration the challenge from some of britains leading employers based on their own actions to get rid of red tape and bureaucracy is the perfect base on which we will build
2510688 we are very encouraged by the drive from john denham and welcome the proposals for cutting red tape around apprenticeship programmes this will strengthen our commitment and help us achieve our aim of doubling the number of apprenticeship places we offer this year
2510689 at tesco we know the apprenticeship programme brings great benefits not only through the new skills our colleagues gain but also for how it helps them to develop their careers with us
2510690 we applaud the efforts from government and john denhams drive to minimise the bureaucracy that employers face around apprenticeships
2510691 less red tape benefits everyone and enables more of our colleagues to access work based learning and apprenticeships
2510692 placebo can affect patients response to pain therapy and also influence the results of clinical trials
2510693 we have shown that responses to experimental placebo alter how the brain responds to pain and also that responses to experimental placebo persist in repeated testing in healthy volunteers
2510694 we hope this study will help us understand how the brain deals with pain and is also likely to lead to the development of new pain killing therapies and better ways of testing then
2510695 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2510696 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2510697 many schoolchildren learn how rivers meander and form ox bow lakes but these processes are still very poorly understood when it comes to submarine channels these channels are built by currents carrying large volumes of sediment and seem to be far more stable and far less likely to meander or form ox bow lakes than those on land
2510698 the sands and gravels deposited by these sub sea giants have in many cases trapped valuable accumulations of fossil fuels
2510699 what the companies have to do is make estimations using very limited data anything that can give them a clearer picture of where to find the oil and gas will be very valuable
2510700 an individual production well may cost over 50m so understanding and predicting the distribution of the different rock types that hold these hydrocarbons is critical for optimising well type and location and therefore producing more of the oil
2510701 in most oilfields they dont manage to recover all the oil and gas in some cases most is actually left in the ground from both an economic and an environmental point of view it makes sense to get as much as you can out
2510702 understanding the differences between submarine channels and rivers will enable improved geological models and enhanced oil production from these giants of the deep
2510703 mps1 is a rational target because of its critical role in preventing aneuploidy

2510707 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private

2510742 highlands and islands airports limited and dundee airport are committed to working with airlines to develop new scheduled routes for the city of dundee and surrounding regions
2510743 as part of this work we have launched a short online survey to assess the potential demand for direct flights between dundee and amsterdam the more people who take five minutes to complete the survey the stronger our business case to airlines will be
2510744 a direct link to amsterdam would be of enormous economic benefit to this area for business and leisure travel and is an important route development target for us

2510767 the creation of baggames tm began on a surf trip to tamarindo costa rica where the evenings w ere the perfect downtime to play backgammon
2510768 the problem was we didnt bring a game because no one wanted to lug around a full sized board in our already stuffed backpacks we could have brought along a travel version but who really likes playing with those tiny little pieces on a miniature board anyway no one in town had even heard of backgammon much less had one for sale our only option was to conjure up our own makeshift board we found a small sign company to draw up the board per our description and used colones costa rican currency for the checkers
2510769 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2510770 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2510771 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games

2510789 along with lavish display of every sort philip included in the procession statues of the twelve gods wrought with great artistry and adorned with a dazzling show of wealth to strike awe to the beholder and along with these was conducted a thirteenth statue suitable for a god that of philip himself so that the king exhibited himself enthroned among the twelve gods every seat in the theater was taken when philip appeared wearing a white cloak and by his express orders his bodyguard held away from him and followed only at a distance since he wanted to show publicly that he was protected by the goodwill of all the hellenes and had no need of a guard of spearmen

2510818 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2510819 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2510820 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2510821 na t rovom pere vyhr va ka d kto na p de koly dok e vydm va xsvoj asop
2510822 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2510823 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2510824 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2510825 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2510826 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2510845 mr zalewski said shortly after selling off 26 units in bulk to 50 biscayne suites llc in may the development partners paid off the construction loan to lasalle national bank that meant they no longer had to sell at whatever price the bank says is necessary he said

2510848 lucas lechuga a realtor with miami condo investments said its hard to say if and when the vulture funds action will affect prices
2510849 if the buyer puts them back on the market at a discount it will affect the price and make it very difficult for people trying to sell individual units he said
2510850 in an interview last year attorney robert barron a shareholder at berger singerman said creation of vulture funds is a logical outcome of the credit crunch but the funds could bring unforeseen repercussions all around
2510851 one problem is that whatever the discounted units sell at will become the comparable sales price for the project he said and that will indirectly affect other buyers who have to get financing

2510863 the u s census bureau reported wednesday that manatee countys population grew by about 3 000 people in 2007 over the previous year
2510864 nancy engel executive director of the manatee county economic development council warned that the county might not be as lucky this year because a lot of construction workers are leaving the area because of the housing industrys decline
2510865 looking at the 2006 to 2007 numbers i dont think anyone expected there to be a decrease in the population
2510866 scott cody a demographer with the university of floridas bureau of economic and business research speculated that some of the census bureaus population estimates may have been slightly inflated in prior years
2510867 with the previous estimates we are not quite sure how many households were vacant condos or just speculators buying property and there wasnt really a permanent resident living there he said

2510876 a cheerful sign outside the glistening offices of bank united beckons consumers to tap into mortgage ade another promises a 59 minute mortgage but easy money it turns out has created enormous problems at bank united floridas biggest regional bank
2510877 by aggressively peddling a popular type of high interest loan to risky borrowers the bank tripled its profits in 2006 as real estate on floridas gold coast peaked only to lose nearly 100 million in late 2007 and early 2008 as the market cratered now its ceo alfred r camner is scrambling to raise 400 million in capital an amount nearly eight times the banks shriveled value on the stock market
2510878 in an interview mr camner who is also the banks controlling shareholder testily defended the banks strategy we did it for over 10 years he said referring to the banks use of a risky but highly attractive product known as an option adjustable rate mortgage
2510879 for a very long time it was an excellent performing package
2510880 the strategy proved lucrative bank uniteds assets more than doubled to 15 billion from 7 1 billion in 2003 while its total loans rose to 12 5 billion from 3 9 billion by last october the end of the banks fiscal year mr camner had allowed option adjustable rate mortgages to dwarf overall mortgages three to one
2510881 bank united found itself on a particularly slippery slope as its newfound base of risky regional borrowers eroded from mid 2006 to early 2008 the percentage of its assets designated as nonperforming soared more than fivefold to 4 75 percent
2510882 the bank clearly did not understand the risks said gerard cassidy a banking analyst at rbc capital markets
2510883 jubilant environmentalists cheered brevard county commissioners unanimous approval tuesday of land purchases that experts said would secure a critical conservation corridor between the st johns river and merritt island national wildlife refuge
2510884 the commission approved three deals allowing the voter approved environmentally endangered lands program to acquire more than 1 500 acres in scottsmoor for 21 1 million land the program had pursued since the early 1990s
2510885 during two hours of discussion speakers argued that the land bisected by interstate 95 linked a swath of conservation areas that had statewide importance for bio diversity and water quality but as with other recent conservation purchases the county was accused of paying too high a price
2510886 the total cost fell by 3 million since november when commissioners at the urging of clerk of the court scott ellis requested updated appraisals to capture falling real estate values
2510887 every single purchase that has been delayed has saved millions of dollars ellis said

2510892 nbc s summer show baby borrowers was trumpeted by network publicists as an intriguing new social experiment actually it was nothing of the sort
2510893 it was crass commercialism that demonstrates nbc is shamelessly willing to exploit real people even babies to make a dollar
2510894 nbc used real people and showed them on national television in situations that are highly personal and in many cases embarrassing
2510895 sure the baby borrowing teens went into this program voluntarily and the parents of the experimental children gave permission for use of their kids these teen couples however couldnt have really known what they were in for other than the opportunity to be on tv and so what if some parents are willing to farm out their kids as props for network exploitation networks should have a stronger moral standard than to strip these young human beings of their dignity in front of a national audience
2510896 if you want to see little kids crying and misbehaving volunteer at a daycare center if you want to observe that teens can at times be clueless try substitute teaching at a high school and if you want to know whether teens are ready to be parents just ask a local social worker
2510897 even though nbc s ratings are last overall among the four major networks the network recently announced a reverse compensation plan to its affiliates nbc will dump the longstanding practice of paying local stations to carry its network programming and instead will now charge those stations a fee fox television has done this for several years but nbc will be the first of the old big three nets to charge for its programs one must wonder if local affiliates will pay to air programs such as baby borrowers if enough affiliates balk at paying for such fare perhaps network programmers will get the message and look for programs that are more socially redeeming

2510908 in een relatie is het belangrijk dat je met elkaar blijft praten ook als je even helemaal niet wilt praten
2510909 mensen communiceren vaak vanuit een negatieve emotie en dat zorgt voor problemen vaak hebben ze helemaal niet door dat ze vanuit een negatieve invalshoek met iemand praten ze vergeten hierdoor waar het werkelijk om draait
2510910 welke gedachten komen bij je op als gevolg van een negatieve emotie weerhoudt jezelf vervolgens van reageren vanuit die gedachten en kom met een open vraag wat bedoel je precies hoe komt het dat je dit zo hebt gedaan
2510911 stel je bent jaloers omdat je partner teveel naar andere vrouwen kijkt je denkt dat hij met al die vrouwen naar bed wil die gedachte komt voort uit de angst om verlaten te worden als je die angst onder woorden kunt brengen heb je een open situatie waarin je meer over elkaar te weten kunt komen bovendien treedt er een verdieping in je relatie op omdat je het hebt over de dingen die er voor jullie echt toe doen

2510962 its a good thing i didnt have to throw after that said damon who hit the fence with his left shoulder the same shoulder he banged against the wall on july 4 at yankee stadium which put him on the disabled list with a sprain through july 20
2510963 i felt like i got ahead of guys fine he said
2510964 he was up with his pitches and they made him pay
2510965 rasner did an outstanding job for us girardi said good enough to replace kennedy well find out soon enough
2510966 im just not real upset about it kennedy said more than once
2510967 hes in our rotation im just saying but youve got to find a way to get better said manager joe girardi adding that he planned to talk to kennedy today it could be assumed that hed also speak with general manager brian cashman about kennedys spot

2510969 we have to play perfect ball to beat this team

2510971 i felt like i got ahead of guys fine he said

2510973 we gained some confidence but know that the americans were at half strength
2510974 we have nothing to lose in this game all the pressure is on them
2510975 we gained some confidence but know that the americans were at half strength

2510977 tell heaven from hell blue skies from pain can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail a smile from a veil do you think you can tell
2510978 i am very happy about our performance today against i would say a technical and good japan
2510979 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is so we will improve our game from one game to another
2510980 besides a great goal by carli lloyd im very happy about our tactics with fast play up top amy rodriguez and the way heather oreilly played on the right side
2510981 i am very happy about our performance today against i would say a technical and good japan
2510982 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is so we will improve our game from one game to another
2510983 besides a great goal by carli lloyd im very happy about our tactics with fast play up top amy rodriguez and the way heather oreilly played on the right side
2510984 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
2510985 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2510986 john edwards is an extraordinary human being who made an egregious error
2510987 i feel sad because i know john edwards so well
2510988 in life we all make mistakes it breaks my heart if this is going to disqualify him from being a public servant because he would be a great one
2510989 the main reason behind this conclusion lies in the fact that i simply dont see any future for me in the band anymore at least not a future id like to participate in over the coming years

2511030 the injury is considered minor and the budding ace could be back in early to mid september but there is also a chance chamberlain will not return this season simply because the yankees will be extremely cautious with their most prized young arm
2511031 he wants to play for the yankees so he can get at the red sox
2511032 its closed its another home run and the guy is amazing he makes every play and the dodgers are so much better with him ram rezs departure studied
2511033 we still think the pc is a market worth supporting but were not making decision around the pc its probably more of the junior partner in the cross platform strategy although obviously our day to day development is predominately on the pc

2511058 were still servicing prince george with the same frequency that we have since we started
2511059 were still flying three times a day same flight schedule the time that they leave and the time that they arrive are slightly different but honestly its within a half hour of when they would have left under the old system
2511060 so its very important that people go on to our website and see the new baggage allowances
2511061 guests on the dash 8 aircraft can bring a total of 50 pounds of checked baggage
2511062 we really really wanted to find a way to continue to serve prince george because they have been so loyal to us
2511063 the idea of not servicing prince george stopping for a whole month it just didnt seem right to us
2511064 we should make no mistake these two countries russia and georgia are now at war
2511065 if this conflict goes on and the war machines of both countries are now gathering momentum there really could be an enormous amount of bloodshed
2511066 hes always had a real interest in keeping up to date on the latest technologies
2511067 it really has relevance too because vegas may be far away geographically but all the threats that theyre talking about can hit anyone anywhere
2511068 we mostly work with small and medium businesses here in northern b c and if they want to keep current and competitive they have to kind of push the envelope on technology
2511069 so what were getting out of it is well be aware of what the real threats are going to be coming up in the next year
2511070 this is a beautiful city where everybody is coming together as a team

2511088 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2511089 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2511090 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2511091 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2511092 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time

2511107 sabe mejor que nadie porque ha pertenecido a l que este gobierno es el que m s ha cumplido
2511108 si est en la calle es que algo hemos hecho mal todos
2511109 d por sentado que acatar la decisi n del tc
2511110 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2511111 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2511112 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2511113 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2511114 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2511115 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2511116 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2511117 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2511118 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2511119 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2511120 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2511121 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2511122 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2511123 si est en la calle es que algo hemos hecho mal todos
2511124 d por sentado que acatar la decisi n del tc
2511125 quer a acabar las series entre los primeros estoy muy satisfecho de mi tiempo pero no sab a que iba a ser capaz de nadar tan r pido hoy aunque esto me sirve para hacerme una idea de lo que soy capaz de hacer

2511183 just like lot and abraham i have endowed the christians in america with much wealth in many circles
2511184 why is it that there is so much confusion about sales and marketing why is it that when i walk into a board room we are forever arguing about whether or not they are the same they are not the same id really like for someone to create an easy to understand explanation of why sales and marketing are not the same thing
2511185 you spend eight years with an organization and then in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there

2511277 imajo lahko legalno pravico vendar je ta absolutno v nasprotju s slovenskim nacionalnim interesom
2511278 njihovo bogatenje pomeni negacijo temeljnih vrednostnih na el na katerih gradimo dru bo in so bila tudi podlaga za na o osamosvojitev pomeni negacijo tega da lahko tvoj standard status blagostanje temeljijo izklju no na uspehu tvojega dela in prizadevanj saj sporo a da z delom v tej dr avi ne pride nikamor
2511279 v dru bo globokih antagonizmov ki se bodo v bodo nosti ele pokazali v dru bo ki bo prej ali slej e se bo to nadaljevalo morala tudi formalno opustiti demokracijo kajti bistvo demokracije je neenakost ki je vendarle funkcionalno utemeljena

2511283 omenjena polarizacija se dogaja ravno zaradi sedanjega na ina vladanja ko tisti ki je dosegel ve ino na volitvah postavi vlado iz esar sledi da je ta odraz ve ine in je parlament vnaprej obsojen na vlogo glasovalnega stroja
2511284 na a vlada je e vedno izvr ni svet ali politbiro
2511285 s tem smo dobili sistem ki je v bistvu diktatura preoble ena v formalni pla demokracije
2511286 politika se na vse pretege trudi da bi ta proces zaustavila vendar bodo stvari le svojo pot ne glede na to kak na bo vlada
2511287 vlada mora uveljavljati vrednostne cilje ki jih postavlja parlament ne pa da je gospodar parlamenta
2511288 vlada mora uveljavljati vrednostne cilje ki jih postavlja parlament ne pa da je gospodar parlamenta in da prihaja v nasprotje tudi s predsednikom dr ave ker ji mora biti tudi ta podrejen tako kot pa mora biti v sistemu diktature
2511289 al pred sedanjimi volitvami ne vidim nobenega koncepta ampak prav na nobeni stani nobene politi ne platforme ki bi nastopila z novimi koncepti vse skupaj je samo pre vekovanje starega

2511355 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2511356 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2511357 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2511358 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2511359 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer

2511362 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2511363 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2511364 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2511365 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2511366 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social

2511422 da f r mich die kunst und die heiligen die gr te apologie unseres per me larte ed i santi sono la pi grande apologia della nostra fede gli argomenti portati dalla ragione sono assolutamente importanti ed irrinunciabili ma poi da qualche parte rimane sempre il dissenso invece se guardiamo i santi questa grande scia luminosa con la quale iddio ha attraversato la storia vediamo che l veramente c una forza del bene che resiste ai millenni l c veramente la luce dalla luce e nello stesso modo se contempliamo le bellezze create dalla fede ecco sono semplicemente direi la prova vivente della fede se guardo questa bella cattedrale un annuncio vivente essa stessa ci parla e partendo dalla bellezza della cattedrale riusciamo ad annunciare visivamente dio cristo e tutti i suoi misteri
2511423 wenn wir um die vern nftigkeit des glaubens streiten in dieser zeit quando in questa nostra epoca discutiamo della ragionevolezza della fede discutiamo proprio del fatto che la ragione non finisce dove finiscono le scoperte sperimentali essa non finisce nel positivismo la teoria dellevoluzione vede la verit ma ne vede soltanto met non vede che dietro c lo spirito della creazione noi stiamo lottando per lallargamento della ragione e quindi per una ragione che appunto sia aperta anche al bello questo penso in qualche modo la prova della verit del cristianesimo cuore e ragione si incontrano bellezza e verit si toccano e quanto pi noi stessi riusciamo a vivere nella bellezza della verit tanto pi la fede potr tornare ad essere creativa anche nel nostro tempo
2511424 ich w rde zwei wesentliche teile in meiner antwort gerne sehen wollen nella mia risposta vorrei considerare due aspetti fondamentali da un lato linsostituibilit del sacerdote il significato e il modo del ministero sacerdotale oggi dallaltro lato e questo oggi risalta pi di prima la molteplicit dei carismi e il fatto che tutti insieme sono chiesa edificano la chiesa e per questo dobbiamo impegnarci nel risvegliare i carismi dobbiamo curare questo vivo insieme che poi sostiene anche il sacerdote egli sostiene gli altri gli altri sostengono lui e soltanto in questo insieme complesso e variegato la chiesa pu crescere oggi e verso il futuro

2511444 the effect on my clients on a day to day basis of the failure to prosecute is severe
2511445 i am sure you will appreciate that my clients were severely damaged as children accordingly they are hurt scared and scarred
2511446 a failure to prosecute and convict would be the ultimate betrayal of them by the government it would be the ultimate rejection of them and of their rights as human beings
2511447 police are being thwarted by those in charge of the prosecution
2511448 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up
2511449 there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry
2511450 one file has been with the attorney generals office since april 29 and its still showing no signs of moving at the moment its been very frustrating
2511451 the ordinary people of jersey are overwhelmingly in favour of the inquiry but how many expressions of support and sympathy for the victims have we heard from the politicians none they dont do sympathy for the victims
2511452 do not give what is holy to dogs and do not throw your pearls before swine or they will trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces
2511453 you promised me lord that if i followed you you would walk with me always but i have noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there has only been one set of footprints in the sand why when i needed you most have you not been there for me
2511454 the years when you have seen only one set of footprints my child is when i carried you
2511455 for whoever does the will of god he is my brother and sister and mother

2511457 when you pass through the waters i will be with you and through the rivers they will not overflow you when you walk through the fire you will not be scorched nor will the flame burn you
2511458 he who has found his life will lose it and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it
2511459 i am the light of the world he who follows me will not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life

2511490 yahoo has said it expects to generate an additional 250 million to 450 million in additional cash flow in the first 12 months after the agreement goes into effect
2511491 his view was that you couldnt be a specialist in every discipline within the sport
2511492 he understood the basics of biomechanics and eventually became an extremely capable physiologist but he didnt spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about those issues he found people who could spend time worrying about them while he concentrated on the coaching and bringing the team together
2511493 in the world of coaching and inspiring and influencing there are few men in the history of british athletics of whom it could be said that they were truly among the greatest

2511499 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
2511500 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
2511501 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
2511502 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
2511503 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
2511504 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
2511505 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet
2511506 its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats
2511507 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
2511508 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
2511509 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
2511510 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates

2511514 david has always been a leader in our family and obviously hes a leader with his comrades and his troops and were just proud of him
2511515 this is another example of their type of activity that is an attempt to sexualize our young people
2511516 it seems to make fun of sex making it as some kind of game as planned parenthood claims when sex is something so sacred that it should only be between a married man and woman
2511517 guys guys it looks like its getting a little hot and heavy in here
2511518 before we take this to the next level we want to make sure that you know how to use a condom
2511519 each person is portrayed as a loser with no depth which is very demeaning to young people
2511520 the question that has to be asked is this how planned parenthood views its clients
2511521 we wanted to empower people to really take care of their own reproductive and sexual health
2511522 through the web site and the videos we wanted to speak in a language that would be non threatening to a younger demographic
2511523 we wanted to start a conversation with planned parenthood and engage young people in a conversation about reproductive and sexual health
2511524 this web site was especially repulsive to me because it appeals first to very young teenagers and contains scientifically inaccurate information but also because it denigrates sexual intimacy
2511525 for men especially regular testing does not show threat information on human papillomavirus hpv or herpes
2511526 ensuring the availability of fair and balanced information to the american public
2511527 no i do not expect that bill by pence to come to the floor certainly not in the time that is remaining
2511528 there is a real concern about the monopoly of information and the skewering of information that the american public gets
2511529 obviously if one group or a large group controls information and only allows one perspective to be presented thats not good for democracy that is not good for the american public that is of course what the fairness doctrine is directed at and it can have great merit but there are obviously complications involved in that as well
2511530 with the support of speaker pelosi and the majority leader for a return of the archaic legislation that combined with the support of senator durbin senator kerry and senator feinstein it seems very clear to me that should the next congress remain in the hands of the democrats there will be an effort to restore the content regulation of the so called fairness doctrine to the airwaves of america
2511531 but to this hour not one democrat has signed the petition
2511532 senator obama does not support re imposing the fairness doctrine on broadcasters
2511533 he considers this debate to be a distraction from the conversation we should be having about opening up the airwaves and modern communications to as many diverse viewpoints as possible
2511534 sometimes what you hope and pray for actually happens which is kind of overwhelming
2511535 this is question of fairness and it is a question of equity
2511536 the fairness in this question is that we have allowed people to marry in massachusetts who could not legally marry in their own state for decades and now we want to change our way we are applying a bit of law we have never enforced that i think is unfair
2511537 create a relationship and then set it adrift to settle in a disapproving state
2511538 they cant divorce in rhode island because the law does not recognize the marriage
2511539 they cant divorce in massachusetts because there is a one year residency requirement for filing
2511540 with this legislation we will place sharp and sorely needed limits on access to tobacco products and on tobacco advertising and marketing
2511541 could be perceived by the public as an endorsement that these products are safe resulting in more people smoking

2511601 estimando la demanda debemos declarar nulo por ser contrario al ordenamiento jur dico el acuerdo recurrido del gobierno de navarra de 13 3 2006 por el que se confirma la orden foral 512 2005 de 12 de septiembre que concede autorizaci n ambiental integrada para la actividad de producci n de energ a el ctrica en una central t rmica de ciclo combinado en el t rmino municipal de castej n navarra
2511602 ninguna duda cabe de que la actividad de una central t rmica de ciclo combinado de una gran potencia como lo son los 400 mw es una actividad molesta insalubre nociva y peligrosa y no puede considerarse al caso presente la excepci n que a la regla general de las distancias contiene el art culo 15 del reglamento 2414 1961 ya que como tal excepci n debe fundarse en razones justificadas concretas y bastantes para hacer asumible el sacrificio del inter s p blico que la regla asume en el presente caso ninguna raz n se ha dado para justificar tal sacrificio la administraci n se limita a negar la aplicabilidad de dicha norma en navarra y que la misma no es b sica y de necesario cumplimiento en el sentido de que tal norma cumpla una funci n o fin unificatorio en todo el territorio nacional sino simplemente una ordenaci n de m nimos que en todo caso se ha de respetar pero que puede ser mejorada por la respectiva comunidad aut noma la sala entiende a la vista de la doctrina sentada por el tribunal supremo que si es norma b sica y al mismo tiempo asume lo dicho por la administraci n en el sentido de que es una ordenaci n de m nimos y que puede ser mejorado y ampliado por la comunidad aut noma pero en el presente caso lo cierto es que la administraci n demandada no s lo no ha mejorado el m nimo establecido por la norma sino que lo ha incumplido manifiestamente al autorizar dicha central t rmica de ciclo combinado e 400 mw de potencia a 500 m del n cleo m s pr ximo

2511655 i know he feels we need more players this year but you can never stop believing your aim has always got to be improve every year at least its mine and i think it is still be achievable

2511707 the church is truly the mother of all her children they do not impart life to her but she imparts life to them the church is in no sense the product of individual christianity as though a number of persons should first receive the heavenly fire in separate streams and then came into such a spiritual connection comprising the whole but individual christianity is the product always and entirely of the church

2511834 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2511835 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2511836 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2511837 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2511838 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2511839 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2511840 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2511841 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2511842 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2511843 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2511844 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2511845 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2511846 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2511847 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2511848 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2511849 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2511850 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2511851 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2511852 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2511853 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2511854 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2511855 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2511856 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2511857 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2511858 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2511859 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2511860 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2511861 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2511862 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise

2511879 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2511880 tanto non pago lho deciso anni fa boskov non paga il biglietto a samp e non vuole tessera io prima giocatore poi allenatore sono sampdoriano vero quando decido di andare allo stadio entro e basta
2511881 ero centrocampista organizzatore di gioco destro mio piede sinistro ho imparato
2511882 lho marcato in amichevole lui grande campione veloce tecnico forte nel dribbling io ero a fine carriera nel 1960 andai alla samp poi un anno in svizzera poi torno a casa e dico a mia moglie yelena non gioco pi perch pallone pi veloce di mio piede capito anni non perdonano nessuno
2511883 bene sono ancora su due piedi capito sono autosufficiente e vado in giro con le mie gambe
2511884 novi sad la mia citt ed la citt pi bella del mondo una citt di tante genti ungheresi slovacchi ebrei serbi croati si andava daccordo con la forza delle differenze perch luomo scambio e adattamento s e poi il fiume si allarga come un mare piatto come un tavolino e ci sono spiagge bellissime e si pu prendere una barca e tenerla anche quindici giorni per navigare
2511885 nella vita e nel pallone vince solo chi ha dissiplina
2511886 quando arrivavo in spogliatoio dieci minuti prima di allenamento tutti gi cambiati e pronti
2511887 se io sciolgo il mio cane lui gioca meglio di perdomo
2511888 ma io non dire che perdomo giocare come mio cane io dire che lui potere giocare a calcio solo in parco di mia villa con mio cane
2511889 coppa delle coppe e che vale a me sembra che valga di pi la coppa del nonno
2511890 chi mazzone forse mi invidia perch io ho vinto titoli e coppe dappertutto e lui ancora nulla
2511891 in partitella di allenamento quando ero calciatore mio allenatore patek si fa male a ginocchio si ferma e mi lancia il fischietto continua tu io prendo suo posto in squadra e anno dopo diventato allenatore giocatore e suo fischietto da quel momento sempre con me alla samp un giorno lucavialli fa scherzo e fa sparire fischietto da spogliatoio per una settimana non parlo con nessuno e alla fine urlo ridatemi fischietto o vi ammazzo dopo poche ore ricompare fischietto vado a perugia e partita perugia milan 1 2 loro scudetto noi salvezza sento urla in spogliatoio dopo la fine della partita entro e trovo alessandro gaucci arrabbiato con la squadra perch abbiamo perso io dico tu esci da qui e non urlare perch noi salvi lui dice ok ma lei non sar pi lallenatore del perugia io vado in macchina e subito via a casa senza prendere i bagagli fischietto rimasto negli spogliatoi e io smesso di allenare
2511892 paolo mantovani presidente super mai chiedeva quanti soldi volevi lui diceva signor boskov rester ancora con noi poi faceva scrivere una cifra al direttore generale sempre alta i ragazzi avevano una disciplina imposta dalla societ divisa elegantissima con fermacravatta senza cravatta al collo non potevano neanche salire sul pullman
2511893 mi disse che mi voleva la juventus ma che dovevo fare prima un anno di esperienza in una squadra pi piccola
2511894 la maglia era splendida il blu poi quei cerchi bianco rosso neri
2511895 e meglio perdere una volta per 3 0 che tre volte per 1 0
2511896 semplice mi piace mi esalta se perdi lentusiasmo sei morto sono le ore trascorse ogni giorno sul campo tra tanti giovani che mi fanno sentire vivo e anche le sorprese che il calcio propone positive o negative rappresentano uno stimolo costante e avvincente ognuno ha il proprio carattere c gente che a cinquantanni sogna gi la pensione io no
2511897 genoa e samp erano come vecchie e nobili compagnie di navigazione che ritrovavano improvvisamente splendore dopo decenni di piccolo cabotaggio alla samp non tenevano un vero e proprio dossier sui giornalisti per facevano una feroce esegesi degli scritti una mezza frase storta e finivi bollato come avversario la citt era divisa in zone anche i ristoranti erano etichettati la sampdoria era molto goliardica e autogestita il genoa era sanguigno pi naif pi genovese la samp si lamentava di essere snobbata a livello nazionale odiava lidea di essere solo una provinciale di successo voleva legittimazione il football si scrisse era uno dei pochi aspetti positivi di una citt in decadenza eugenio buonaccorsi docente di storia del teatro e tifoso blucerchiato fece un corso monografico dedicato al calcio nellanno accademico 1991 92
2511898 ah lo so toglieremo loro la felicit il problema sar dove nasconderla perch non la trovino mai
2511899 no ricordati che abbiamo dato loro la forza prima o poi qualcuno salir fin lass e la trover e se la trova uno anche tutti gli altri sapranno dove trovarla
2511900 no ricorda che abbiamo dato loro lintelligenza prima o poi qualcuno costruir una macchina con la quale potr raggiungere il fondo del mare
2511901 no ricorda che con lintelligenza un giorno qualcuno costruir una nave spaziale con la quale potranno viaggiare verso altri mondi e la scoprir e tutti avranno la felicit e saranno uguali a noi
2511902 credo di sapere dove metterla perch realmente mai la trovino
2511903 la nasconderemo dentro loro stessi saranno tanto occupati a cercarla fuori che non la troveranno mai
2511904 everyone here knows theres no food allowed in the classroom
2511905 if someone doesnt start explaining how that pizza ended up on the newly installed carpet that our principal from hell is going to kick my ass over
2511906 if someone doesnt tell me how that pizza got there we are all missing recess
2511907 i cannot tell a lie mrs tasses i was reentering the room when i noticed that i had a slice of pizza stuck to the bottom of my shoe
2511908 i ever so gently rubbed my foot to remove the pizza and didnt think to pick it up and throw it in the trash
2511909 that pizza was not on the bottom of your shoe that pizza was in your pocket
2511910 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2511911 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2511912 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2511913 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2511914 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2511915 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2511916 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2511917 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2511918 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2511919 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2511920 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2511921 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2511922 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2511923 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2511924 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2511925 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2511926 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2511927 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2511928 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2511929 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2511930 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2511931 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
2511932 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2511933 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2511934 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2511935 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2511936 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2511937 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2511938 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2511939 wir wissen dass viele kunden auch au erhalb der usa daran interessiert sind den kindle zu kaufen und dementsprechend wollen wir den kindle auch in anderen l ndern zur verf gung stellen
2511940 op de markt heb ik ook zulke kleine en groene zien liggen hij is echt wel goed
2511941 mannen die een oppepper in hun seksleven nodig hebben moeten watermeloenen eten die blijken een stof te bevatten die hetzelfde werkt als viagra
2511942 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2511943 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2511944 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2511945 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2511946 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2511947 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2511948 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2511949 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2511950 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2511951 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2511952 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2511953 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2511954 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2511955 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2511956 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2511957 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2511958 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2511959 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2511960 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2511961 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2511962 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2511963 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2511964 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2511965 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2511966 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2511967 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2511968 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2511969 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2511970 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2511971 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2511972 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2511973 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2511974 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2511975 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2511976 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2511977 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2511978 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2511979 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2511980 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2511981 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2511982 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2511983 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2511984 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2511985 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2511986 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2511987 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2511988 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2511989 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2511990 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2511991 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2511992 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2511993 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2511994 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2511995 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2511996 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2511997 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2511998 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2511999 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2512000 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2512001 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2512002 es wird weitere untersuchungen brauchen da der angreifer ja selbstmord begangen hat weitere kommentare k nnen wir derzeit nicht abgeben
2512003 sie trugen keine kleidung die sie als mitglieder der us delegation auswies noch als amerikaner
2512004 ich bin hier mit meinem mann und meinem kind wir leben unseren traum
2512005 fiquei no meio deles dois quando o silv nio pegou uma faca e meu pai meteu uma cadeira nele
2512006 ele n o tinha os movimentos das pernas por causa de um acidente
2512007 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2512008 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2512009 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2512010 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2512011 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2512012 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2512013 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2512014 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2512015 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2512016 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2512017 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2512018 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2512019 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2512020 its good for the world to have girls playing softball
2512021 and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2512022 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2512023 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2512024 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2512025 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2512026 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2512027 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2512028 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2512029 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2512030 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2512031 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2512032 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2512033 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2512034 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2512035 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2512036 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2512037 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2512038 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2512039 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2512040 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2512041 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2512042 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2512043 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2512044 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2512045 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2512046 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2512047 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2512048 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2512049 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2512050 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2512051 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2512052 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2512053 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2512054 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2512055 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2512056 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2512057 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2512058 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2512059 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2512060 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2512061 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2512062 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2512063 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2512064 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2512065 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2512066 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2512067 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2512068 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2512069 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2512070 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2512071 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2512072 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2512073 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2512074 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2512075 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2512076 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2512077 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2512078 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2512079 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2512080 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2512081 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2512082 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2512083 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2512084 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2512085 la oferta resulta extremadamente suculenta y seguro que el coche no habr durado mucho en sus manos aunque para eso
2512086 the ability to express ideas assume leadership and arouse enthusiasm among people
2512087 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2512088 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2512089 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2512090 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2512091 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2512092 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2512093 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2512094 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2512095 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2512096 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2512097 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2512098 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2512099 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2512100 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2512101 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2512102 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2512103 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2512104 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2512105 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2512106 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2512107 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2512108 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2512109 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2512110 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2512111 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2512112 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2512113 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2512114 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2512115 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2512116 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2512117 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2512118 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2512119 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2512120 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2512121 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2512122 weve had to increase security at the powerstation and members of staff have been worried by what might happen to them
2512123 the power station is generating its business as usual so much to the extent it can be on this extraordinary day
2512124 we just want to try and send a message to people that we dont want anymore new coal its something thats not going to help our future at all
2512125 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2512126 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2512127 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2512128 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2512129 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2512130 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2512131 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2512132 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2512133 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2512134 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2512135 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work

2512139 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2512140 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2512141 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2512142 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2512143 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2512144 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2512145 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2512146 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2512147 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2512148 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2512149 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2512150 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2512151 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2512152 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports

2512158 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2512159 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2512160 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2512161 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2512162 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2512163 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2512164 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2512165 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2512166 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2512167 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2512168 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2512169 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2512170 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2512171 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2512172 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2512173 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2512174 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2512175 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2512176 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2512177 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up

2512184 how could bruneis olympic committee miss the deadline to register our athletes what do these people do theres a whole committee to look after two athletes everyone was there even iraq and afghanistan even the poorest countries in the world were there im so depressed
2512185 i feel a bit disgrace when our national flag is being carried by a foreign talent during the olympic opening ceremony why are we buying talents to bring an olympic medal back
2512186 we sent a little more than a dozen athletes most of whom perhaps were trained some place else to the biggest sporting event in the world i dont know with you but id say that reflects the pathetic state of philippine sports
2512187 i would put my praise on china for such an awesome fantastic bombastic acrobatic out of this world opening that i would have to rethink of any other nation that could ever beat the beijing games in years to come i am very much sure that there is a great sense of envy that china could build up such a spectacular show i had the feeling of pride swimming in my heart despite the host nation having little to none of connection to me i guess this is what they call one asia for the whole of asia
2512188 the opening ceremony was simply spectacular china really took this opportunity to inform the world about itself in some subtle ways the coming in of the athletes in the non conforming way of the usual alphabetical order i believe that this shows that china is prepared not to heed any rules but instead is ready to make its own rules in fact it already has for the world to follow
2512189 this awesome opening ceremony was simply mind blowing they captured my heart and thoughts from a sporting and world citizen perspective the crowds were simply superb the performances dazzling and spectacular showcasing how the inventions and creations of china helped to shape the world it certainly lived up to its reputation and promise to be the best olympics opening ceremony in history
2512190 its great to see a fellow asian country putting up such a wonderful spectacle but as the chinese spent millions to make sure their olympics is a success i cant help but think about the millions of people in darfur who are suffering because of the chinese continued sponsoring of the genocide there china may have staged the greatest olympic opening ceremony ever but they have to look at themselves for assisting in the death of hundreds of thousands of people thousand miles away
2512191 a celebration of sports and not a bad brew of politics
2512192 we shouldnt import too much of the calculations of politics into the striving of honest sportsmen let them show off their sporting skills
2512193 the vietnamese broadcaster didnt really say much about any of the countries until it got to the former soviet bloc he was talking about sergey bubka when ukraine was announced i guess all the communist countries know each other

2512206 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2512207 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2512208 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2512209 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2512210 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2512211 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2512212 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2512213 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2512214 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2512215 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2512216 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2512217 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2512218 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2512219 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2512220 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2512221 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2512222 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2512223 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2512224 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2512225 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2512226 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2512227 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2512228 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2512229 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2512230 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2512231 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2512232 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2512233 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2512234 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2512235 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2512236 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the

2512261 today is a very big occasion as august 9 is celebrated as quit india movement day this movement was started to drive away english from india today there are certain religious forces who want to break this country on the name of caste and religion

2512266 georgia is a peace loving nation but today we are being attacked north to south east to west
2512267 for us it is very difficult to observe the absence of swift and appropriate response from the international community
2512268 however i would like to remind you once again that the russian federation which represents a side and now in fact is the aggressor is a permanent member of the security council with veto power this of course complicates taking any concrete tangible decisions within the council

2512270 i am very happy because during my first match i scored a goal and my team achieved a very important victory

2512272 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
2512273 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2512274 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2512275 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2512276 it was really a good game but its too bad to draw after the 94th minute and 25 seconds we kept putting pressure for 90 minutes and created some chances
2512277 we took the second goal at the last moment but we shouldnt have drawn 2 2 in the end we must keep our concentration until the very end

2512316 i insist upon the equal existence of the world engendered in the mind and the world engendered by god outside of it if i have faltered in the use of familiar objects it is because i refuse to mutilate their appearance for the sake of an action which they are too old to serve or for which perhaps they had never been intended i quarrel with surrealists and abstract art only as one quarrels with his father and mother recognizing the inevitability and function of my roots but insistent upon my dissent i being both they and an integral completely independent of them
2512317 only in expressing basic human emotions tragedy ecstasy doom and so on and the fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures shows that i can communicate those basic human emotions the people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience i had when i painted them and if you as you say are moved only by their color relationship then you miss the point

2512356 we always knew that norway would be disciplined hard to break down but we didnt expect that much possession
2512357 we have to beat the usa now to move through and we can do it

2512385 once you have the taser and its been accepted and legitimized i see nothing wrong with officers being able to use it on teenagers

2512711 the night starts here forget your name forget your fear
2512712 its amazing what a fair bit of softer data can do
2512713 the reserve bank has talked down interest rates quite a bit they made it clear in their statement thats what theyre going to do and thats been convincing for us
2512714 they want to see softer domestic demand but they want to see wages growth remain under control
2512715 there are tighter financial conditions and then theres a second round effect of falls in equity prices and a weaker housing outlook as well as higher oil prices
2512716 growth is going to slow and stay down well below potential for the next couple of years so we dont have any inflation problems
2512717 its a case of trying to avoid these downside risks to growth which appear to be there at the moment
2512718 high petrol prices the credit crunch and the reserve bank tightening has had a big dampening effect
2512719 we havent seen that rise in national income since the korean war of the 1950s
2512720 with the jobs market remaining quite resilient theres still risk to interest rates remaining at the level theyre at
2512721 we would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time
2512722 there are many people in electorates like mine who are really doing it tough at the moment
2512723 if the reserve bank takes a view and takes a decision to cut rates they will be the very people the reserve bank has in mind
2512724 if they do not receive the full benefit of what the reserve bank has intended then in a way thats subverting what the reserve bank is trying to do through its monetary policy
2512725 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow
2512726 at the end of the day were a commercial organisation
2512727 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks he told reporters in beijing
2512728 working families and australian pensioners and carers are under financial pressure from rents from mortgages from all sorts of cost of living pressures and therefore if banks are not going to do the right thing then were trying to make it possible for customers to vote with their feet he said

2512743 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2512744 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2512745 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2512746 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2512747 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2512748 tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them
2512749 the american people are worse off than they were eight years ago
2512750 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2512751 would you agree that the back and forth conversational aspect of the music blogosphere has died down somewhat in the last few years any theories as to why
2512752 we believe the bank of england really had little option to keep interest rates at 5 00
2512753 the ever growing likelihood of recession calls for lower interest rates yet this is precluded by elevated inflation levels and risks
2512754 if so this would signal that the bank will almost certainly be on hold again in september
2512755 it suggests that the economic slowdown is now a symmetric shock affecting the eurozone broadly and not only the already fragile countries such as spain
2512756 with a renewed focus on high quality higher value wines to suit global consumer demands
2512757 we are eliminating less profitable individual labels focusing on brand building and increasing pricing to restore appropriate levels of profitability
2512758 these actions are designed to reduce our cost base and improve our margins
2512759 there will be those where the profits are so skinny that they cant be seen and those where theres too much complexity

2512763 a veces las costumbres de las madres est n arraigadas en tradiciones incorrectas muchas consideran que la muerte del ni o es algo normal lo tienen interiorizado
2512764 as i looked upon my grandfathers happy face i only had one wish grandfather may you live a
2512765 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2512766 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2512767 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2512768 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often

2512771 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2512772 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2512773 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2512774 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2512775 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2512776 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2512777 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2512778 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2512779 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2512780 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2512781 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2512782 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2512783 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2512784 tal y como est n las cosas una victoria muy contundente del pp en las elecciones europeas que puede llegar a producirse puede dejar al gobierno de zapatero temblando

2512794 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2512795 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2512796 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2512797 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2512798 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels

2512803 the love of god has been poured out in our hearts by the holy spirit
2512804 i know a girl who says she wants to take me to an owl sanctuary the second biggest in the country

2512806 i was very nervous and excited all at the same time it was good just to get rid of all those butterflies and get out there
2512807 i am looking forward to the challenge in the final
2512808 that wasnt bad but it was only a heat so hopefully i can get another good one in the final
2512809 i wasnt nervous that is how i am normally for the heats but i am sure i will be a little jittery in the morning
2512810 it was one of my best prelim swims things were playing on my mind a little bit you cant come here and not feel the pressure
2512811 there were a few nerves again today but they werent too bad
2512812 that was a bit faster than i did in the europeans so i am pretty happy about that
2512813 the atmosphere was really good everybody telling you go go go ive never had that feeling before
2512814 our goal was to hit our routines and i think we achieved that im very very pleased with this incredible group of young men
2512815 the ring doctor thinks hes ok but he sent him to hospital anyway for scans
2512816 i dont enjoy inflicting such injuries because it can always happen to me
2512817 although we faced problems with the ioc problems in iraq problems of getting our athletes here because there is no proper flight and no proper visas in the end we did it
2512818 now im just happy to be here and the most important thing for us was the raising of our flag

2512859 we waren te voorzichtig en bleven in het midden van de baan terwijl de boten langs de kust en de boten op zee ons voorbij gingen

2512865 the conditions were just so humid and so hot it was just a real war of attrition today
2512866 will they be able to perform up to the level of their conditioning given the pollution its less about long term health risks thats not the issue
2512867 we tried very hard to work out in the worst part of the day and we stayed out there when it was hottest
2512868 we played once we warmed up for a competition i think it was under 10 or under 12 and we hit together for a warm up
2512869 i tried to hit so good to impress him that i was tired and i couldnt play my match so i lost

2512925 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2512926 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2512927 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2512928 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2512929 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2512935 i wanted to create a magazine that i really wanted to read i was the customer and us subsequently became the magazine that i was dying to read
2512936 traditional clothing represents a tighter family unit and this may offer some protection against some of the pressures that young people face
2512937 what it suggests is that we need to assist people who are moving from traditional cultures and becoming integrated into western societies as they may be more vulnerable to mental health problems
2512938 there are many ways in which people can be british these girls who have good mental health and still have a strong traditional culture are by implication settled and comfortable with their identities
2512939 this verbal incitement is based on the extremely sordid and impudent allegation that our women are not modestly dressed this was and still is a flagrant lie used to justify violence against women in the name of religion
2512940 we weten het niet 100 procent zeker maar hij heeft die tas waarschijnlijk gestolen
2512941 waarschijnlijk heeft hij in berichten in de media gelezen dat we bereid waren om duizend euro te betalen
2512942 marnix zag het gewoon niet meer zitten hij moest zelfs dit weekeinde nog evenementen afzeggen omdat hij zijn platen niet had
2512943 think different is what should define every company not me too
2512944 clearly theres a critical lesson to be learned here in a category that is based almost exclusively on a bland product a commodity like say vodka tissues water whatever to truly break through your point of difference often needs to be engineered
2512945 we need to spend quality time with god every day so get up early every morning beg god to speak to you personally through the bible and then read it expecting that he will then pour yourself out to him in prayer
2512946 as long as christians fail to repent of self righteousness we will continue to speak of evangelism in terms such as outreach which implies we will not embrace lost people but will keep them at least an arms length away
2512947 the transformed lives of people in the church are both the greatest argument for and the greatest explanation of the gospel therefore it welcomes non christians into the church not so much through evangelistic programs as through informal relationships like jesus developed with his first disciples this evangelism considers it vital that lost people be brought close enough to witness the natural and practical outworking of the gospel in peoples lives
2512948 i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2512949 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
2512950 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
2512951 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice
2512952 if this guy is who you say he is lets ask him to start a church on the strip i mean someones got to try it maybe this guy would be willing to do it
2512953 umm hey im in the call and i can hear you
2512954 well at least for those ongoing costs wont the offerings pay for all that
2512955 wow god let me off the hook he knows a church has to be started on the strip but found someone else to do it
2512956 we want this new church to be a forefront thing and so wed like some forefront people to move with you and be a part of it
2512957 i know who you are you re from river valley pri sch
2512958 most classicists consider me one of the greatest latin lovers but i digress
2512959 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus
2512960 yeah its great that there will be a church on the vegas strip but what about forefront whats going to happen here in virginia beach

2512969 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2512970 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2512971 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2512972 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2512973 we could have made historic investments in to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time

2513025 people on the right can always say this doesnt represent family values and they can make these negative associations with hip hop that then barack or any other candidate is put in a position to defend
2513026 i am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics but i think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music
2513027 hip hop is a celebration of not only what is right but what is wrong in society
2513028 a lot of times artists like ludacris they push the envelope in terms of describing the contradictions of american society

2513116 the landlord gave him the benefit of the doubt but the next time he saw the defendant lucas told him he was in fact a firearms officer
2513117 in an interview he accepted that he had lied in the tenancy agreement
2513118 this is rather an unusual offence it must be said and mr lucas didnt actually get very far
2513119 he attempted to secure accommodation and nothing more than that there is no suggestion that he persuaded anyone he was acting in the duty of a police officer and in terms of financial gain nothing was made
2513120 he is remorseful particularly to his girlfriend to whom he had lied in order to impress her

2513141 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2513142 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2513143 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2513144 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2513145 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2513146 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2513147 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2513148 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2513149 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2513150 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social

2513153 youre crying over such little hardship why are you being so weak i think you should just go home go home
2513154 este incumplimiento por parte del gobierno del estado es una mala noticia no valen excusas
2513155 no se puede decir que se quiere cumplir un plazo legal presentando una propuesta incompleta que no se ajusta a los principios de la propia ley
2513156 cumplir el plazo con una propuesta infra estatutaria no es cumplir el plazo y la responsabilidad es de quien ha presentado la propuesta que nadie se enga e que nadie se confunda
2513157 las bases no suenan bien las primeras notas desafinan ni tocan la partitura estatutaria ni parecen la m sica adecuada

2513177 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2513178 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2513179 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

2513191 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2513192 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2513193 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2513194 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2513195 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2513196 the measure fails to include funding for areas that will grow the most over the next 30 years
2513197 the antelope and santa clarita valleys will more than double in population over the life of this sales tax measure yet receive only 5 of the total project funding the san gabriel valley and gateway cities both have approximately 19 of the countys population and also generate approximately 19 of the countys sales taxes yet both areas were given much less than 19 of the total project funding available the san fernando valley represents over 15 of the countys population but will only receive 5 of the total project funding available depriving valley residents 2 3 of its fair share of funding
2513198 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2513199 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2513200 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2513201 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2513202 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2513203 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2513204 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2513205 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2513206 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2513207 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2513208 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2513209 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2513210 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2513211 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2513212 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2513213 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2513214 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2513215 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2513216 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2513217 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2513218 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2513219 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2513221 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2513222 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2513223 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2513224 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2513225 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2513226 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2513227 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2513228 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2513229 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2513230 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2513231 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2513232 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2513233 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2513234 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2513235 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2513236 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2513237 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2513238 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2513239 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2513240 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2513241 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2513242 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

2513280 we signed the petition in march and since then homeowners have been bombarded with letters and demands from greenbelt group saying they dont recognise this
2513281 we very much welcome the scottish governments backing in this situation and hope it will encourage both gladedale and greenbelt group to see sense
2513282 it is good news that the scottish executive confirmed that the action the residents took in their dispute with greenbelt has been confirmed as the correct course of action
2513283 up until now greenbelt has tried to ignore the actions of the residents at menstrie mains and i hope that it will now take on board the strong legal footing on which the residents have based their campaign and understand that they no longer want greenbelt to supply land management services
2513284 i hope that both the greenbelt and gladedale can find a constructive way to bring this long standing problem to a solution which meets the aims and objectives of menstrie residents
2513285 greenbelt has never considered itself to be a manager of the land but in fact the owner of the land which is a significant difference to what is being said by other parties
2513286 soundbites have been taken from a very complicated piece of legislation which needs to be understood as a whole and is very technical
2513287 there is an agreement in place between ourselves and the developer and that will continue
2513288 we are obliged to manage and maintain the land and residents are obliged to contribute fully and equally
2513289 we are aware of the issues between the residents and greenbelt and are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached between the two parties

2513298 an outright recession is now our central scenario with industrial production having fallen in both q1 and q2 industry is already in recession
2513299 looking ahead the more up to date surveys suggest that in q3 so far overall economic growth has ground to a complete halt
2513300 the recent drop in the oil price and the price wars on the petrol forecourts support our view that the next rate cut could come late this year but this will be too late to prevent a recession
2513301 in terms of the outlook we look for even weaker growth and possible contraction in q3 and q4
2513302 growth has been much worse than the bank of england expected what really counts is what that does to the two year ahead outlook for inflation
2513303 i expect prices to fall on average by about another 20 or so bringing the cumulative decline from the most recent peak to around 30
2513304 against this backdrop it is not surprising that the high street appears under increasing pressure with consumers scaling back purchases of a range of household goods
2513305 unless the authorities take steps to restart the mortgage market the likelihood is that there will be more bad news in store for the both the housing market and the retail sector during the latter part of the year
2513306 in terms of the housing market things could get worse before the bank of england cut rates given its focus on inflation
2513307 even if they mortgage approval figures dont fall any further these numbers are consistent with house prices continuing to fall quite rapidly
2513308 un toque de atenci n a los problemas de los argentinos
2513309 6 de setiembre de 1930 o el mito de la revoluci n
2513310 quienes narraron una primera historia del golpe de estado fueron los medios de comunicaci n masiva
2513311 los peri dicos articularon una primera representaci n global y unificadora del golpe de estado
2513312 esta representaci n global y unificadora encontr en la palabra revoluci n su anclaje m s firme
2513313 la prensa supo activar uno de los mitos pol ticos modernos m s poderosos otorg ndole al golpe de estado una tradici n pol tica heroica fundante de una nueva legitimidad
2513314 son los diarios los que garantizan una continuidad democr tica que el mismo golpe esta poniendo en juego a trav s de una nueva legalidad pol tica
2513315 y si en tanto acto revolucionario es el pueblo el que deber a fundar soberanamente la nueva legitimidad pol tica los diarios elevan al ej rcito a representante de ese pueblo ausente presentando al gobierno de facto como gobierno popular
2513316 el gran mito de la revoluci n se ala precisamente que quienes protagonizaron o fueron testigos del golpe de estado vivieron en realidad una experiencia revolucionaria
2513317 fue ese mito revolucionario el que modelo los comportamientos colectivos y otorg un sentido heroico al primer golpe de estado pero a su vez ocluy la posibilidad de pensar el futuro pol tico
2513318 solo con mercados nunca falt ning n grano para el mercado interno la ltima vez que tuvimos que comer pan negro fue con los mercados intervenidos no digo que la intervenci n del estado sea siempre un mal en si mismo pero si estoy seguro que el mercado es mejor que una intervenci n manejada por una manada de burros corruptos e ineptos

2513324 el campo nacional y popular est mucho m s vivo que hace un par de d as se fueron los que se iban a terminar yendo tarde o temprano y ahora van a venir los que no estaban porque no se iban esos mercenarios

2513345 it was obvious that any downturn in the housing market would put the project at risk
2513346 the fair would have made a great contribution to the highlands in terms of leading new ideas on how homes can be developed
2513347 a recommendation will be made to the highland housing fair board to delay the fair from august 2009 to august 2010 in recognition of the economic climate and the shortage of finance available to realise the ambitions of the developers who are committed to the project
2513348 the recommendation will be made at the meeting of the highland housing fair board which will take place in august 2008
2513349 far better to delay than to fail ignominiously and in any case the reasons for the postponement can be readily understood by all
2513350 what developer was going to proceed even had they been able to secure the necessary funding with construction at current inverness price levels when the bottom is dropping out of the housing market and likely to pummel the post housing fair sales values

2513352 i love when my boyfriend breathes warm air behind my ear then gives me soft warm kisses on my neck and shoulders
2513353 i love it when my boyfriend pulls away just to look into my eyes for a moment
2513354 i love when my husband groans while were kissing and when he seems more interested in the kiss than i am
2513355 i love when my boyfriend runs his fingers through my hair until he reaches the back of my head where he cups it gently and pulls me near him then he slowly lets his fingers drag down my neck back up to the side of my face
2513356 i love when he pins me against the wall and lets my hair down strokes my cheek then kisses me on the mouth
2513357 i love when my partner flicks his tongue behind my earlobe it drives me insane
2513358 my boyfriend does this thing that drives me crazy i love it while we are kissing we slow it down and he breaks apart until our lips are barely touching and with his tongue he traces my upper and lower lip
2513359 i love when my boyfriend comes up behind me and puts his arms around my waist then he begins to kiss the back of my neck and slowly turns me around to face him we kiss deeply

2513404 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

2513409 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2513410 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2513411 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2513412 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2513413 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2513414 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2513415 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2513416 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2513417 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2513418 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2513419 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2513420 it is heartbreaking it is very very hard to do but i am trying to be strong about it and do what is best for me
2513421 i am so grateful for michala i am just so happy to be handing the role to her
2513422 and it was at that moment i realised you cant do it all and you cant save everybody
2513423 i learned to decide what works well for me so my spirit can continue to be nourished and i can grow in a positive way
2513424 sometimes you get in a rut where its all about work the next job the next thing the next step in the career
2513425 i had to take time to grow as a woman the balance of those things create a much fuller life and better music
2513426 when you are not afraid to fall thats when you fly the highest
2513427 they allowed me to discover so much about myself the woman i want to be and the woman i want to become
2513428 the industry is filled with trials and trick daddies lions tigers and snoop dogs
2513429 it was mostly trying to maintain a balance of my integrity as an artist and not being pulled in all directions
2513430 when you are really young you dont know the traps and the way some people will take advantage of your ignorance and innocence
2513431 but you live and you learn to create the environment you want
2513432 a lot of times we look for someone to do something magical to create the possibility but its really inside you you have all the answers
2513433 they wanted to create move forward and make a ruckus
2513434 gangsta rap is a ploy to convince black people to kill each other
2513435 ive cleared it up and i dont want to perpetuate the silliness
2513436 but i couldnt believe something like that could be taken to such a ridiculous place
2513437 there are so many newsworthy things i do every day all very positive that never get run its disappointing
2513438 the show is an excursion and a good time you will see how i started out you will see that i wanted to implement the piano in my creative process it gives me the foundation to talk about my journey as an artist
2513439 i would rather be called smart than sexy and as long as im beautiful on the inside thats the kind of beauty i want
2513440 id written a few songs then stopped and thought no im going over old ground
2513441 this is the most rock record ive ever done which is good
2513442 i wanted to get away from what the public perception of a david bridie record would sound like
2513443 guantanamo is a great word to sing it has a wonderful rhythm
2513444 the goon squad fell last november and what a fall that turned out to be
2513445 out in the streets were still dancing finally we got back our country twelve years felt like a lifetime never thought id see the day
2513446 desperate song of survival of a yearning for a sense of community
2513447 im just saying we dont have to give in to that stuff
2513448 you get to experience a different side of what the worlds about when youre there
2513449 i think its the role of an artist to comment on things you just try not to do it in too polemic a way
2513450 i was living in lagos when i sent a tape to the french foreign ministry music program
2513451 it was a message in a bottle for me i did not know if anyone would ever hear it i just hoped and prayed for the best
2513452 we started to talk about the situation in my country about the youth what we say and also what we see on television
2513453 fire on the mountain is an awareness song bringing people back to reality showing that things are happening that things are not getting better but we can actually do things by getting conscious and trying to make an effort to change it
2513454 that wasnt consciously done i just wanted to sing and say something but in saying it i wanted to be happy in my melody and my approach to it
2513455 i went to university but got really frustrated with my studies before i picked up a guitar and learned how to express myself
2513456 one of my big breaks came when i met a blind multi instrumentalist from nigeria
2513457 it is crazy over here now because every second person is recognising me in the street
2513458 i wasnt that happy because i thought i was missing out on a lot of things and sometimes i had to go to school and it wasnt fun then because it was very cold and i had to wake up to have my bath with cold water and there wasnt even much food so it wasnt really fun for me
2513459 now when i look back i say thank you to my parents i dont know another life apart from that
2513460 when he gave me that new technology it changed my life
2513461 i want to give hope back to my people and also speak in their name
2513462 i want to show the world that something beautiful and positive can come out of the black continent and inspire young people all over the world
2513463 i encourage girls to branch out and try new things

2513494 tradisjonen med konfirmasjon kan spores helt tilbake til oldkirkens dager men i norge fikk ordningen for alvor vind i seilene da konfirmasjon ble p budt i 1736 det ble lovfestet at alle i l pet av sin ungdomstid skulle konfirmeres gjennom en offentlig eksamen i den kristne tro og en kirkelig innvielse med h ndsp leggelse og forb nn med p budet ble konfirmasjonen en juridisk inngangsbillett til det voksne samfunn ingen kunne tas ut til milit rtjeneste inng ekteskap v re fadder ved d p eller vitne i retten uten konfirmasjonsattest og dersom man ikke hadde m tt til konfirmasjon innen fylte 19 r kunne man straffes med tukthus eller gapestokk

2513501 hylland eriksen har fanget opp at religion er blitt popul rt i hans kretser andres religion vel merke og blir kanskje derfor skarpere idet han avfeier et par ateister som bombastiske skr sikre og intolerante og blir akkurat det selv religion er jo ikke rsaken til vold tvert imot har religion i alle r v rt et middel til dempe vold ikke en heks har blitt brent eller et korstog eller en terroraksjon utf rt i religi s gl d men s garderer han seg lenger ut i boka hvis religion kommer i veien for nestekj rlighet er vi mange som vil betakke oss helvete og protestantisme misliker han p bisetningsniv han synes v re for arrangerte ekteskap indiske ekteskap blir bedre og bedre motsatt vestlige vil noen for alvor nske at frivillig ekteskapsinng else i vesten erstattes av ekteskap der foreldrene velger partner nei da s alvorlig er det aldri ment han siterer mange men ikke friedrich schiller som skriver at vi b r gj re det riktige ikke strebe etter lykken skal folk i vesten og f rst de rike sp rre f r jeg og mine det enda bedre hvis vi hindrer en varmekatastrofe noen vil mene at vi b r gj re det som er n dvendig riktig uansett kanskje gir det litt mening og lykke ogs hvis ikke den private lykkef lelsen blir motivet for da glipper den
2513502 tildekkingen av kvinner som i dag forbindes med islam er ikke en praksis som er grunnleggende eller opprinnelig for islam koranen ber rer ikke sp rsm let om kvinner b r dekke hodene sine da det ikke var noen aktuell problemstilling p muhammeds tid denne skikken startet f rst noen f generasjoner etter muhammeds d d skikken er et kulturelt l n fra bysantinsk kristendom og fra de persiske zoroasterne begge disse kulturene hadde lenge forlangt av sine kvinner at de skulle dekke seg til i utgangspunktet ble tildekkingen ikke praktisert av alle kvinner men kun av overklassens kvinner som statussymbol
2513503 striden om muhammedkarikaturene oppfattes som en vestlig kamp for ytringsfriheten for retten til lage rasistiske tegninger av arabere og tr kke p troende muslimer samtidig er det ogs en dansk kamp mot muslimers rett til ytre seg kritisk i det offentlige rom plutselig ble blasfemi greit for v re hjemlige konservative kristne tegne muhammed med en bombe i turbanen ble en viktig frihet samtidig er det ingen som v ger tegne en kristus med bombe i tornekransen eller en j de med en bombe i kippaen det siste ville v rt rasistiskt

2513514 where the infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than 200
2513515 had no knowledge or understanding of file trading online distribution networks or copyright infringement
2513516 kazaa and similar products did not inform me that the materials available through their service were stolen or abused copyrighted material and i had no way of learning this information prior to this lawsuit
2513517 i f a notice of copyright appears on the published phonorecord to which a defendant had access then no weight shall be given to such a defendants interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement
2513518 readily could have learned had she inquired that the music was under copyright
2513519 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
2513520 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
2513521 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
2513522 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
2513523 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
2513524 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
2513525 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
2513526 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
2513527 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
2513528 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
2513529 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
2513530 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
2513531 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
2513532 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
2513533 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
2513534 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
2513535 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
2513536 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

2513556 no other european country gives 95 percent of custody to mothers
2513557 ideally custody should be 50 50 with fathers able to have input in their childrens lives
2513558 the government appears scared of womens organisations when chartering fathers entitlements
2513559 psychiatrists and child psychologists often come in to muddle the situation
2513560 during custody hearings for child support a large number of fathers suddenly become poor due to unemployment or being unfit for work
2513561 for a father earning 1 200 euros child payments are around 350 euros per child

2513610 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2513611 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2513672 we are hoping to find several different types of vents along the ridge
2513673 some of the vents will be very similar in depth to the vents we already know about and because the conditions will be alike we might expect very similar animals
2513674 the deep ocean is our planets largest ecosystem if we are going to use its resources responsibly then we need understand what determines its patterns of life

2513729 yet it would be your duty to bear it if you could not avoid it it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what is your fate to be required to bear
2513730 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2513731 die befreiten sind von den strapazen der geiselhaft gezeichnet aber es geht beiden den umst nden entsprechend gut
2513732 bernie mac is vanmorgen overleden in het northwestern memorial hospital in chicago heb alstublieft respect voor de familie ze willen de komende tijd met rust gelaten worden
2513733 in het leven telt een menselijk leven oneindig veel zwaarder dan welk ander recht dan ook
2513734 in het leven telt mijn leven oneindig veel zwaarder dan welk ander leven
2513735 he ran wearing his boxers boots and a t shirt and jumped into a nearby pond
2513736 he went to the middle and began to tread water still refusing to surrender officers went to get a boat and we heard him slap the water and call for help he went under and did not resurface
2513737 she was able to force herself down on to the floor and not be cooperative grabbing on to the detective a taser was dry stunned onto her arm to control her hand movement then she was cuffed
2513738 she was scared because the person identified themselves as a police officer
2513739 shes blind and they pulled her off her futon handcuffed her and tased her because he said she swung at him she cant see
2513740 im very frustrated and upset dayton police need to implement a sensitivity program
2513741 i was almost in tears because i know the lady and i look out for her because shes blind
2513742 she does not have to open her door it was a voluntary thing for her to open her door
2513743 cops did things such as restrained people threw them to the ground or against a wall or pointed a gun at them
2513744 in nine out of 10 police stops involving use of force in 2006 the suspects were not arrested
2513745 the data confirms our worst fears the nypd is stopping interrogating and searching hundreds of thousands of innocent new yorkers every year and even pointing guns at completely innocent people new yorkers deserve a police force that will protect their rights not violate them
2513746 80 percent of the time they are used on unarmed suspects
2513747 without killing you tasers can do a hell of a lot of damage and the evidence is mounting that they
2513748 just having them on the holsters has been a huge deterrent
2513749 theyre bright yellow and when people just see them they become very cooperative
2513750 the response from troopers in the field has been completely positive
2513751 one of the key reasons is that using tasers means its much less likely that an officer will become involved in a physical confrontation that could result in injuries to the suspect or the officer
2513752 it is a weapon they can use if they feel they need to
2513753 some of them take a hit voluntarily but its not a requirement
2513754 listen to the police or be subject to a potentially lethal device
2513755 a disproportionate number of stocks that underperform the market by a dramatic margin
2513756 he wasnt injured he had no scratches bruises nothing like that
2513757 they got him loaded into an ambulance and several minutes after being in the ambulance he went limp
2513758 this guy comes out and hes naked we dont know if hes on any type of drugs
2513759 when police got there he surrendered he was not a threat
2513760 because the taser was over and hes still combative that tells me hes conscious and breathing and theres no cardiac arrhythmia
2513761 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
2513762 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
2513763 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody laying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
2513764 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
2513765 its a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic to keep him from getting hurt
2513766 it seemed awfully fast for an ambulance to be showing up
2513767 im pretty sure it couldve been done a better way
2513768 thats why you listen to the police when they tell you to do something
2513769 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2513770 he who the son has set free is free indeed
2513771 cast off the devils heavy chain forget his lies so thou mayest gain the surpassing joy i can give to thee and life and light and liberty
2513772 behold the shadow of my thought shall lie upon them wherever they go and my hate shall pursue them to the ends of the world i am the elder king melkor first and mightest of all the valar who was before the world and made it the shadow of my purpose lies upon arda and all that is in it bends slowly and surely to my will but upon all whom you love my thought shall weigh as a cloud of doom and it shall bring them down into darkness and despair wherever they go evil shall arise whenever they speak their words shall bring ill counsel whatsoever they do shall turn against them they shall die without hope cursing both life and death

2513868 jul 27 2007 banks purposely ripping you off with overdraft fees some bank accounts charge you a fee just to check your account a call years ago spoke of getting hit with an overdraft fee even though they knew they had a good balance was this a clerical error no its a new strategy in banking that tricks people into overdrafting their accounts so that the bank can charge them banks used to reject transactions that they knew would cause an overdraft not anymore many banks now purposely approve transactions that they know will overdraw your account according to congressional hearings banks made 17 5 billion dollars due to this even worse many banks use software programs to see what will cause the most bounced checks or give you false balance reports at atms so that you youll overdraw clark thinks a bank should at the very least inform you that theyre going to try to rip you off by approving transactions that will cause overdraft fees you now need to take additional steps to monitor your account as closely as possible to avoid getting ripped off

2513882 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2513883 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2513884 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2513885 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2513886 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2513887 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time

2513912 a lot of the top players went out in the first round
2513913 as the rounds progressed and my nerves became less and less and i kind of just let things happen and trusted my instincts and in the gold medal bout i just let everything flow
2513914 i had to take every bout today like it was the final i couldnt give anybody breathing room
2513915 we couldnt have asked for a better result today three american flags being raised on the first day of the fencing event
2513916 fans always cheer when the offense catches the ball they get a first down and they cheer they only cheer for the defense if we get some crazy sack or an interception for us to have a rule go our way one thats good for us for a change i feel like celebrating like we just won a championship game
2513917 we feel like if we catch the ball inbounds it should be a catch it will change things defensive backs are just going to shove you out of bounds now it could definitely impact some plays
2513918 it helps them kind of like an extra defender as a receiver you have to make sure you get yourself open more and come down with the ball and get your feet in you have to be even more aware of the boundary
2513919 it might change how some guys defend but i dont want to get it embedded in my brain so much that it changes he way i play on the sideline
2513920 id still rather play to attack the ball and if it gets to a situation where he is in the air and trying to get his foot down well then push him out
2513921 the offensive guys are going to complain about it but it really is about time the defense got one
2513922 but the thing is while we like the change theyre probably going to get more pass interference calls because of it
2513923 if we touch them before the ball is there theyll call us for that and officials are going to be looking for that the way they take care of the offense
2513924 saya sangat dekat dengan keluarga lia semua masalah hukum mereka memang saya yang biasa menangani
2513925 dia lalu menceritakan masalahnya saya kagum melihat cara berpikirnya dia wanita yang kuat cerdas dan tabah
2513926 bukan untuk menekan lia akhirnya bersedia saya dampingi justru untuk menunjukkan keseriusannya dia bilang sama saya om saya sudah berdosa hingga mengandung sebelum menikah apa pun itu saya tidak mau berdosa dua kali dengan menggugurkan kandungan saya saya bangga sekali mendengarnya
2513927 dan saya senang sekali karena ternyata memang masalah ini berakhir dengan damai
2513928 saya pribadi benar benar tidak menyangka pertemuannya berlangsung sangat akrab begitu keluarga ariel tiba di lokasi pertemuan lia yang saat itu memakai busana muslim menyambut layaknya seorang mantu keluarga ternyata lia sudah akrab kok dengan kakak ariel ivana
2513929 pertama ariel mengakui dan bersedia bertanggung jawab atas janin yang dikandung lia kedua masing masing pihak saling meminta maaf atas masalah yang sempat timbul ketiga kedua belah pihak sepakat untuk segera meresmikan hubungan ariel dan lia menjadi suami istri
2513930 manajemen peter pan meminta tanggal dan tempat pernikahan sepenuhnya mereka yang atur hal ini mengingat jadwal peter pan yang amat padat dankontrak kontrak tersebut tidak bisa dibatalkan begitu saja
2513931 karena pertemuannya kan amat kekeluargaan saya tidak mau merusak suasana dengan penandatanganan perjanjian segala cukuplah saya menjadi saksi
2513932 kalau soal langgeng tidaknya sebuah pernikahan tentu tak ada yang bisa menjamin
2513933 pertemuan kemarin berlangsung baik dan lancar sekali awal yang baik saya yakin akan menghasilkan akhir yang baik pula
2513934 bahkan ke depannya pun saya sudah punya antisipasi jadi saya akan selalu ada kapan pun lia memerlukan
2513935 rencananya antara seminggu setelah pertemuan hingga pertengahan februari tepatnya kapan pihak manajemen yang mengatur
2513936 itulah yang menjadi masalah semalam saya kontak budi manajer peter pan red dia minta pengertian pihak lia karena kondisi ariel yang sedang sakit jangankan pernikahan jadwal show pun jadi kacau semua jadi saya amat memaklumi jika jadwal pernikahan diundur dari rencana semula
2513937 daripada dipaksakan lalu arielnya pingsan gara gara enggak kuat dan masih sakit ya lebih baik diundurkan yang penting ariel benar benar menepati janjinya menikahi lia
2513938 dia laki laki baik kok saya tahu itu dia datang dari keluarga terhormat dan taat beragama jadi saya yakin dia enggak akan ingkar wong itu adalah darah dagingnya sendiri
2513939 biar saja orang ngomong apa yang penting arielnya sendiri sudah mengakui bahwa itu anaknya
2513940 ya jelas kan dia sendiri yang datang ke rumah tantenya lia di jl bangka jakarta untuk bertemu saya dan ibunya lia
2513941 malah ada niat untuk tidak memberitahu keluarganya untuk sementara jadi nikah diam diam dulu ini karena ayah ariel katanya sakit jantung
2513942 tapi terus enggak jelas kabarnya sampai masalah ini tercium wartawan
2513943 ini kan kondisi darurat jadi enggak perlu ada resepsi segala
2513944 tapi selasa 25 1 kemarin keluarga dari almarhum papanya lia datang ke sini menjelaskan hasil pertemuan
2513945 we didnt know the president was here until after the game but it was great for him to come and support us
2513946 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2513947 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2513948 would have been the meritorious cause of his obtaining life
2513949 was made with christ in a strict and proper sense as he was the party contractor in it and undertook to fulfill the condition of it it is made with believers in an improper sense when they are taken into the bond of it and come actually to enjoy the benefit of it how it is made with them may be learned from the words of the apostle acts xiii 34 i will give you the sure mercies of david which is a kind of paraphrase upon that passage is lv 3 i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david god makes the covenant with them not by requiring anything of them in order to entitle them or lay a foundation for their claim to the blessings of it but by making these over to them as a free gift and putting them in possession of them as far as their present state will admit by a faith of his own operation
2513950 westminster assembly in this section appear to describe what was then usually designated the covenant of grace as distinguished from the covenant of redemption
2513951 was made with christ as the second adam and in him with all the elect as his seed
2513952 i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my servant
2513953 if his soul shall make a propitiatory sacrifice he shall see a seed which shall prolong their days and the gracious purpose of jehovah shall prosper in his hands
2513954 i was set up from everlasting from the beginning ere ever the earth was
2513955 freely offereth unto sinners life and salvation by jesus christ requiring of them faith in him that they may be saved
2513956 requires of sinners faith in christ that they may be saved
2513957 faith justifies a sinner in the sight of god only as it is an instrument by which he receiveth and applieth christ and his righteousness
2513958 where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith
2513959 to him that worketh the reward is reckoned of debt
2513960 well it may be cold where you live but you have eye candy to look at
2513961 yes thanks shes slowly starving because nursing is so difficult thanks for remining me
2513962 i knew id love her but i never knew how much
2513963 in two minutes again theyd have been in the camp slicing
2513964 andreas hofer commander in chief of took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to future i shall know how to protect my wife from grief and buxtons kept the search going and found nothing very good that home is
2513965 there was a dream that was rome it shall be realized
2513966 i was very nervous and very excited all at the same time and it was good just to get rid of all those butterflies
2513967 not the swim i wanted but thats ok you learn and this is still one of my newer events
2513968 i just took it out a little too fast tomorrow i just got to slow it down a bit and swim a better race mentally
2513969 nobody expects too much of you out there but im going to bring some fire from the outside
2513970 im not focusing on that im really focusing more about the process and looking forward to the challenge
2513971 its going to be hard to beat them but im in good shape and im going to try everything i can
2513972 i think to win this race you need to go under 4 05
2513973 we didnt know the president was here until after the game but it was great for him to come and support us
2513974 there is a lot of pressure on us but weve prepared for a long time it was a relief to win
2513975 it was good to get the butterflies and the nerves out
2513976 it was the first game of the olympics and it was kind of scary
2513977 i was in doping control and they said hurry up because president bush is waiting for you
2513978 that kind of surreal experience can only happen to you at the olympics
2513979 i dont think ive given 6 16 the kind of look i can give it
2513980 the more experience i have looking at 6 16 the better off i will be in the long run going after it
2513981 i am really confident jumping in bad conditions like rain and wind
2513982 running in there without second guessing yourself without being worried about what bad things could happen opens up mentally some new doors and some good things can come out
2513983 theres just a lot of lower back strain that goes through our bodies
2513984 our backs take a good beating i dont think im ever going to be totally pain free in my lower back
2513985 i hope i can go like this in all the competitions
2513986 i hope im going to be able to do my routines in the finals exactly as i want and exactly as i trained
2513987 the first couple days training here it was just kind of like whoa but today maybe the air was a little bit thinner it wasnt crazy bad for us
2513988 the conditions were just so humid and so hot it was just a real war of attrition today
2513989 will they be able to perform up to the level of their conditioning given the pollution its less about long term health risks thats not the issue
2513990 we tried very hard to work out in the worst part of the day and we stayed out there when it was hottest
2513991 he has no big weaknesses i think he will win anyone can be beaten but i think he is the best boxer in this category
2513992 he wants to win just like everybody else on the team but he also has an emotional reason which is being an olympic champion just like his father
2513993 he hasnt put a foot wrong here hes a world class horse and the cross country course monday will suit him
2513994 she gives the best of herself she was very relaxed
2513995 hes kind of a show off i hoped it would work to his benefit and it did
2513996 im so so excited for the rest of the weekend and that i put up a good score for my country
2513997 a little bit of an adventure but it really didnt affect much
2513998 its my one and only motivation to run real hard for the american team
2513999 people now know if you go slow lagat could win
2514000 in my mind the race will go fast right from the gun but im comfortable doing that as well im ready for it
2514001 i was obviously a little bit nervous because there are all those little bones in there
2514002 anything could break there could be a small fracture because theyre packed in there so tight i was just happy i got the x rays and nothing was broken
2514003 the first couple days training here it was just kind of like whoa but today maybe the air was a little bit thinner it wasnt crazy bad for us
2514004 the conditions were just so humid and so hot it was just a real war of attrition today
2514005 will they be able to perform up to the level of their conditioning given the pollution its less about long term health risks thats not the issue
2514006 we tried very hard to work out in the worst part of the day and we stayed out there when it was hottest

2514016 isso aproximidade do placar mostra que a gente tem time para ganhar de qualquer um o que n o pode ficarmos 13 minutos sem marcar um gol acontece ficar alguns minutos sem marcar isso poss vel mas o que n o pode ficar 13 minutos
2514017 acho que a defesa foi boa a gente fez o que tinha de fazer no primeiro tempo infelizmente elas mataram a gente no ataque
2514018 toda derrota dif cil de ver um lado bom mas n s ficamos 13 minutos sem marcar e no 14 minuto foi quando a gente voltou com concentra o e reagiu isso mostra a capacidade do grupo o que n o podemos deixar as falhas acontecerem
2514019 o primeiro jogo sempre complicado e dif cil pens vamos apenas em fazer um jogo bom pois somos um time em crescimento se voc pensar antes diria que a alemanha ganhou com facilidade e n o foi isso que aconteceu erramos oito ou dez passes f ceis quando n o dever amos errar e eles ganharam no contra ataque
2514020 agora cabe a para cima e temos quatro jogos para ganhar
2514021 ela estava indignada e chorando fiquei conversando com ela durante um tempo fui meio que uma psic loga
2514022 acho que assim mesmo toda atacante quer ficar em campo e marcar gols
2514023 conversarei com ela ap s o jantar mas acho que a jogadora deve ficar chateada com a substitui o

2514030 prospective customers have worked out that you can spend a lot more preparing other makes of cars for the race track
2514031 with the aspid it all comes as standard the car is unique inasmuch as it meets fia safety requirements as well as european homologation standards so it really can be driven from the road directly onto the race track without the need for any special preparation and after a hard race the car is robust durable and safe enough to be driven again on public roads
2514032 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again

2514060 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2514061 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2514062 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2514063 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2514065 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2514066 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2514067 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2514068 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2514069 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2514070 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2514071 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2514072 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2514073 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2514074 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2514075 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2514076 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2514077 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2514078 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2514079 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2514080 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2514081 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2514082 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2514083 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2514084 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2514085 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2514086 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2514087 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2514088 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2514089 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2514090 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2514091 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2514092 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2514093 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2514094 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2514095 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2514096 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2514097 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2514098 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2514099 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2514100 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2514101 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2514102 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2514103 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2514104 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2514105 who are open to doing something on the production side
2514106 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2514107 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2514108 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2514109 ever since the e3 ms megaton last month which had square enix president yoichi wada hamming it up stage with don mattrick grinning like a school boy rumors have persisted that ms money hatted the hell out of square enix
2514110 we have pretty good luck sending to a gmail address

2514119 it was just unbelievable when we first entered the track that was the best part it made it real i think the whole thing was unbelievable just to be a part of it
2514120 thats one of the experiences you remember for the rest of your life
2514121 i knew it would be quick but not that quick
2514122 i didnt think 3 43 1 would be the fastest i thought maybe 3 44 0 or 43 8 but everyone had to work hard to get into that final thats for sure
2514123 i knew it was going to be tight but i didnt want to spend more than i had to spend to get into that final
2514124 i definitely feel i can improve tomorrow i felt pretty comfortable there the whole way and i had a fair bit left in the end
2514125 al qaeda hurt us but not as much as rupert murdoch
2514126 at the moment the commercial networks arent offering us the right carrots
2514127 weve been offered money weve been offered better conditions but im yet to be offered an affair with kerri anne kennerley
2514128 when they start offering the real stuff then well start thinking of going but until then theyre just not trying
2514129 wed really like to have a show that doesnt involve us working 110 hours a week
2514130 that would be a welcome change apart from that wed like it to be funny
2514131 the only reason we got on tv in the first place was cause there was no one else at the time
2514132 now that theres all these other really really solid comedy acts on tv maybe well have to go to commercial tv where theres no quality whatsoever
2514133 we certainly didnt think a wed end up spending 11 hours in jail for it and b wed have a court case that would end up going for almost a year and c wed still be asked about it a year later
2514134 im getting my butt kicked cause i dont have enough mob members
2514135 these two things i know for sure 1 nothing about life is fair and 2 it is not going to get better
2514136 as maya stark pours her heart out in her journal readers are treated to an inside view of a life that is at times exotic and unfamiliar and at other times hauntingly similar to our own mayas struggles become our struggles her pain our pain which makes her successes even sweeter a not so simple life is another triumph for melody carlson
2514137 if were gonna make this work you gotta let me inside even though it hurts dont hide the broken parts that i need to see
2514138 like it or not its the way its gotta be you gotta love yourself if you can ever love me
2514139 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2514140 is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty
2514141 this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop
2514142 i think what is at stake here is the post cold war order
2514143 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2514144 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2514145 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2514146 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers
2514147 kind of things it never lasts and most of all usually i can
2514148 those are the whitest teeth i have ever come across
2514149 were doing it to compel stephen harper to finally do the right thing and stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2514150 if a canadian court directs him to do it i dont think he can say get lost
2514151 its another attempt by mr khadrs lawyers to avoid trial on the charges of murder in violation of the laws of the war attempted murder in violation of the laws of the war conspiracy providing material support for terrorism and spying
2514152 mr khadr should face these charges through a judicial process not a political one and certainly not through the media
2514153 shi if god hated you youd be dead there would be no memory of you in eternity it would be as though you didnt exist like you never existed god doesnt hate you the bible says that he has loved you with an everlasting love he loves you more than i could ever hope to love you

2514162 i am extremely satisfied that the european union does not lose sight of the necessity of the arrest of the other fugitives before welcoming serbia in the e u family
2514163 its totally unacceptable once the evidence is out and the courts have ruled that the crime must be labeled genocide that only the henchmen of mladic and karadzic
2514164 i have no pleasure going to testify im not eager im just eager for justice to be done
2514165 because i had the strong feeling that this war would be investigated and that the war criminals would be punished
2514166 we were under the surveillance of serbian intelligence in 1996
2514167 they knew we had found the initial burial places but they were laughing and drinking slivovitz in the evening because they knew that the evidence of the crime had been erased
2514168 we would find only 110 bodies clustered at a site where our information indicated that 1 200 people had been murdered and some of these 110 bodies had been sliced into with bulldozers so it was obvious they had been moved
2514169 every time i went in i was astounded to come out with two legs

2514172 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere

2514181 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2514182 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2514183 i think a j was not hustling on the play
2514184 he hit the ball and pretty much thought it was out of play
2514185 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2514186 i thought it kicked away from him just trying to make something positive here hoping we can get a run to score o c did a good job reading the throws

2514197 how long would you estimate it would take to organize an event in second life

2514218 we all know that jeremy got a bad rap by the new york media especially at the end of last season
2514219 it is refreshing for jeremy to go there and have a clean slate with the media which has been exciting and positive and looks at jeremy as another hero that can help uplift an area that has seen a lot of adversity in new orleans
2514220 our goal is to make sure that that price setting mechanisms operate freely smoothly according to market economic principles and the only way to do that is to get more gas flowing there into baumgarten so its not just russia bringing the gas in because then russia sets the price
2514221 so even though you have your own computer and access to the internet you get your research from crazy jane
2514222 well i was going to hold onto it to use as a rebuttal to whatever you were writing
2514223 i dont know what im writing i havent gotten enough information yet
2514224 so by the time you get enough information there may be no one left in darfur
2514225 youre blaming darfur on me i actually suspect that you blame darfur on our president although you may be surprised to learn that the united states of america has contributed almost 2 billion in assistance to improve the situation in refugee camps
2514226 so the united states is the single largest international donor to the sudan and we provide 50 percent of the food from the un world food program to darfur and 70 percent of the contributions to sudan overall and were contributing 16 million to humanitarian campaigns to prevent rape treat vicims and build crisis centers
2514227 and going back to the years 2003 2005 in those two years alone the u s contributed 2 billion to refugee camps
2514228 hmm lets see im not great with numbers but i know that whatever were doing its not enough
2514229 you mean why not just pass the buck because people are starving women are being raped children are being enslaved and orphaned men and women are having their ears and lilps and limbs cut off someone has to do something were supposed to be a superpower so why dont we use our super powers for good instead of evil
2514230 were doing everything we can possibly do the very people who criticize us for policing the world are the same people who criticize us for not doing more in darfur
2514231 so why cant the un send in more peacekeeping troops why cant the un even establish a no fly over zone why are we supposed to do it why are we even supposed to pressure the un to do it why dont they just do it

2514243 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2514244 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2514245 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2514246 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2514247 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2514248 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2514249 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2514250 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2514270 the effectiveness of aba based intervention in asds has been well documented through 5 decades of research children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial sustained gains in iq language academic performance
2514271 when our two boys were diagnosed with asd in bc in 2005 we were facing a debt of 80 000 per year to secure 35 hours of aba per week so we decided to move to winnipeg to enrol in st amants program we learned of other out of province families in the program who waited tens of months without services following diagnosis or who were offered nothing at all we are grateful to mfeat for fighting to get the st amant pre school aba program in place which has paid off enormously for our kids no parent of a child with another serious medical condition has to move provinces or go bankrupt to obtain treatments that are proven effective so why those with asd there is a senate standing committee report telling the government that families with an asd child in this country are in a crisis that needs a national response but it collects dust while our children and families endure major hardships

2514274 mr speaker i am pleased to present a petition from the citizens of british columbia who rightly believe that ibi aba therapy can dramatically help children with autism they are calling upon parliament to amend the canada health act and corresponding regulations to include therapy for children with autism as medically necessary treatment and require that all provinces provide and fund this essential treatment for autism
2514275 the measure of a society is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens the question is not whether we have a legal obligation but whether we have a moral obligation to help these children we need to do everything we can to ensure that children with autism have the opportunity to become healthy and reach their full potential as participating members of their communities
2514276 minister dosanjh has been unsupportive of autism groups since his days as premier of b c i understand their frustration with him as the federal health minister he now has an opportunity to do the right thing and i call upon him to have compassion for autistic children and move forward with a national autism strategy
2514277 what is equally appalling and equally asinine is the statement offered up in defense of mr savage by his syndicator talk radio network
2514278 the network is satisfied that he did not mean any disrespect to autistic children or their families but was instead reiterating his longstanding concerns on public health issues
2514279 we now live in a province that lavishes millions of dollars on bobsledders and junkies but nickels and dimes those with autism fetal alcohol syndrome the mentally challenged and the families who worry about protecting them

2514286 this idea sounds even more sloppily thought out than his last venture which of course went belly up for lack of financial support

2514288 attempts to intimidate individuals from participating in the presidential campaign can be a violation of federal law

2514321 often our peacekeepers go where there is little peace to be kept to places where they are quite frankly the only difference between war and peace
2514322 each one of our peacekeepers has made a real and lasting difference in defending our shared values of freedom democracy and the rule of law as canadians we take pride in their efforts and we are grateful for their service
2514323 its been said that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing canadian men and women have always been willing to step forward to serve our country and the world in times of need
2514324 our government is proud to honour such selfless service and to be doing our part in restoring canadas strong and independent voice on the world stage

2514332 i think a decision is going to be made soon ive had a great time here i was fortunate enough to play on a team that made the playoffs i led the team in scoring three of the four seasons ive been here its been a good experience but we havent been able to come to any common ground its just part of the business you have to do what you have to do sometimes

2514341 i think i adjusted fast to the court conditions breeze and atmosphere here it was wonderful playing in front of such a vociferous crowd
2514342 this is simply not correct if i manage to clear the next round ill possibly face world number three player chen wang of hong kong so its not an easy draw as some believe
2514343 if all else perished and he remained i should still continue to be and if all else remained and he were annihilated the universe would turn to a mighty stranger i should not seem a part of it
2514344 its the first time for indies to have a clean sweep of the best film category
2514345 its an indication of the enthusiasm of indie directors its a good sign that the film industry is being revived by new filmmakers
2514346 i believe the critics cited the indies because these films dont adhere to formulas

2514360 googles soc is a formal sponsorship program tailored specifically to open source
2514361 my primary role has changed from developing drupal web sites myself to consulting with large clients such as mtv sony bmg records bbc and popular science magazine that use drupal my job is to help train their developers help architect web sites mapping wireframes to drupal functionality and to impart best practices and advice that ive picked up from working in the drupal community over the past three years lullabot also gives us time built into our working schedule to work on drupal itself
2514362 an internship is a nice opportunity for both an employer and an employee to size each other up to see if theyd be a good match and real world experience will always trump anything you read in a book
2514363 ive been mostly self taught but i went to school to help fill in some of the gaps
2514364 one of my instructors ian macleod mentioned gsoc it sounded like a wonderful opportunity to me id had a love of open source basically since i first heard the term in the late 90s but i had always lacked the confidence to believe that i could be part of it to be able to get my foot in the door and to be paid to do it at the same time was basically a dream opportunity so i applied figuring what the heck
2514365 someone reading about gsoc might come away thinking the sole goal of the program is for open source organizations to use googles money to pay students to work on much neglected or much needed features
2514366 what a sweet deal however i believe gsoc is more about attracting and retaining talent to an open source project than it is about producing fantastic code
2514367 i would much rather have only semi fantastic code from a student who stays on with the project long term and gets involved in other aspects such as documentation and core development than a 100 working thing of beauty from a student who we never hear from again after gsoc is finished
2514368 students work on something fun that they enjoy and get paid to do it
2514369 it greatly lowers the barrier of entry to getting involved in an open source project
2514370 and if they cant help you they know someone else who can
2514371 its a great way to bug test your documentation to see if its easy for new people to get up to speed
2514372 potentially long term contributors get completely immersed and start taking on additional roles in the project since open source projects thrive on contributors the opportunity to obtain more of them is a huge benefit
2514373 working in open source effectively gives you an open resume
2514374 instead of taking you at your word your employer can actually look at your code and see its progression from when you first started on a project until now they can view your interactions with fellow community members and see how you can effectively solve problems in a team environment you demonstrate your ability to use collaboration tools necessary for serious software development
2514375 this program served to completely shatter the myths i had about how open source projects worked i thought everyone who works on open source is this enormous genius with a huge brain and is some sort of god of programming which paralyzed me from getting involved in open source for nearly 10 years
2514376 everyone contributes what they can whether its a starter solution a fantastic algorithm thatll blow your mind a confirmation that the change works on internet explorer 6 under windows xp or documentation that has proper grammar and sentence structure
2514377 suddenly i was collaborating with people in hungary germany and the united states
2514378 instead of smashing your face on the problem for three days mentors are available who will answer your question in five minutes realizing that its perfectly ok to ask questions and in fact encouraged was one of the hurdles i had to get over students also have the tendency to avoid committing projects until theyre so clean and shiny you can eat off them when i finally learned to commit early commit often i had fewer headaches and a lot more help
2514379 i chose to apply for the quiz module which allows people to use drupal to build web based quizzes and tally the results
2514380 one of the people i did contract work for was kieran lal who was with a drupal company called civicspace labs he had seen me actively participating in the drupal community and paid me to drive a couple of patches home and to write some gnarly technical documentation about the new form api that had just been added to drupal after this kind of test drive he ended up hiring me to work full time and that became my first drupal job in november 2005 three months after completing gsoc
2514381 last year i helped manage drupals participation in the google highly open participation contest which was a gsoc like program but for 13 to 18 year old students with a focus on short term tasks rather than two month long projects
2514382 berry was a ghop student who increased drupals automated test coverage by many orders of magnitude and is now working on the usability testing suite which will allow field testing of proposed user interface changes in order to get immediate feedback from users novak is a three time gsocer with drupal who is passionate about re tooling drupals feed aggregation system
2514383 lenders gsoc project was around an automated testing framework for drupal and he was hired by nowpublic a citizen journalism web site powered by drupal to help manage internal testing procedures several of our students have gone onto jobs within drupal shops and one at google itself
2514384 people often get jobs at companies like red hat with no previous relationship to the company however interning certainly can assist in opening doors and building relationships that lead to full time employment
2514385 there are related roles in engineering sales and marketing positions like these are available at red hat and candidates can review our careers site to find more information
2514386 this is often facilitated by the close relationship that red hat maintains with the
2514387 at red hat our new hires must have the basic skills we require to perform the job so while we dont offer on the job training we do offer opportunities to enhance core skills with additional training for example with our associate technical support engineer role new hires participate in six weeks of in house training and then sit for their red hat certified engineer certification which is paid for by red hat
2514388 we red hat have a three month intern program where interns work for specific departments and participate in cross functional projects the internship program delivers a robust exposure to open source
2514389 beyond that as a growing company and a leader in the open source community we look for entry level employees who can demonstrate an ability to scale with red hat
2514390 with regard to specific technical skills experience with linux up stream work java c c perl and python are big pluses
2514391 one approach for this is to seek additional education or certifications that are in high demand in the marketplace for people focused on an open source career a rhce certification could be a good opportunity
2514392 in the web 2 0 world building a strong network is critical to managing your career utilizing tools such as linkedin facebook and plaxo to build your professional network early in your college career is an important first step
2514393 also try to seek out skill enhancement opportunities that are aligned to your career goals
2514394 many college graduates are finding it difficult to enter the information technology world with little or no work experience
2514395 see what people throw away today its a perfectly good toilet

2514432 for every one hour spent on the table playing the hole card player may spend ten hours scouting most players even if shown a dealer who is flashing would not be able to spot the hole card anyway holecarders spend hundreds of hours training their eyes to see something that flashes by in a fraction of a second often cast in shadow
2514433 part of whats so fascinating about this episode is how this woman who is clearly neither stupid nor insane can hold two sets of absolutely contradictory views that foster care is terrible for kids and that dennis and tom are fantastic parents but that all gay couples including dennis and tom should not be allowed to adopt forcing more kids into foster care
2514434 im not going to move out until they either give us a place to live in and to give us time to get everything for us to build our home but if theyre not going to put us anywhere so were not going to move out because we have no place to go said rita babauta

2514437 how stay at home dads breadwinning moms and shared parenting are transforming the twenty first century family
2514438 if there is one thing i could do to promote gender equality in this country it would be to better share paid and unpaid work between men and women if we strengthen the family provisions of the sex discrimination act that will allow men to be more involved in their family and women to be more involved in paid work
2514439 10 signs that parenting is more equal than it used to be
2514440 somewhat likely to send work related emails late at night
2514441 i see you have a child and are caring for him during the working day so am i lets talk about stocks
2514442 if an adult or child rolls over on a baby the baby can be hurt or even suffocated sleeping with a child can be dangerous especially if you drink use drugs are overweight or sleep on a couch
2514443 no wonder your president has to be an actor hes gotta look good on tv
2514444 his staff insisted the sick vets be sequestered for two hours before cheneys arrival and couldnt leave until hed finished talking officials confirmed
2514445 et sinon pour internet vous avez tout ce quil vous faut
2514446 its time to set the record straight about barack obama and where he really stands on vital issues such as national security and the security of israel
2514447 voters need to know about two items that surfaced today which strongly suggest that an obama presidency will view israel as a problem rather than a partner for peace in the middle east
2514448 you dont even have to go outside obamas campaign to find advisers who are anti israel
2514449 robert malley a principal foreign policy adviser to obama has advocated negotiations with the iranian funded radical terrorist group hamas and urged that hamas which sends suicide bombers to kill innocent women and children receive international assistance
2514450 i noticed again today that sen obama repeated his opposition to giving low income americans a tax break a little bit of relief so they can travel a little further and a little longer and maybe have a little bit of money left over to enjoy some other things in their lives
2514451 obviously sen obama does not understand that this would be a nice thing for americans and the special interests should not be dictating this policy
2514452 sen obama wants to raise the capital gains tax which would have a direct affect on a hundred million americans
2514453 that means he has no understanding of the economy and that he is totally insensitive to the hopes and dreams and ambitions of a 100 million americans who will be affected by his almost doubling of the capital gains tax
2514454 i will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
2514455 telco immunity bill vote shows which candidates are slaves to campaign donors which arent hint obama supporters will be happy
2514456 more common by the time youngsters reached the age of three if their fathers had not taken time off work when they were born or had not used flexible working to have a more positive role in their upbringing
2514457 by international standards swedish fathers take on a good deal of the day to day care of their children
2514458 mothers still stay home longer with newborn children but the responsibility for caring for sick children while receiving benefits from the state is more evenly divided between mothers and fathers it is almost as common for fathers as it is for mothers to pick up and leave the children at pre school and school
2514459 a few years ago i would have told you that paternity leave wasnt that beneficial in terms of recruiting and retaining
2514460 but today i would say these 20 something men are far less burdened by the macho stereotypes and the stereotypes about the incompetent dad than their predecessors they are more plugged in to the enrichment of their children and more comfortable taking time off to be fathers
2514461 men are willing to talk about these things in ways that were inconceivable less than ten years ago
2514462 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who need tax relief
2514463 i dont think you have to have a lot of knowledge about the law to understand this technique violates geneva convention common article three the war crimes statutes and many other statutes that are in place
2514464 hes really not enjoying this i think im ready to go
2514465 youre sure some women pay hundreds of dollars to get exfoliated at the spa youre getting it for free
2514466 little attention has been paid to the impact that womens liberation has had on men the unacknowledged truth is that men have been transformed too today men have more freedom flexibility and choices in the most meaningful ways
2514467 gender should not determine the division of labor at home its a message consistent with nearly every major social trend of the past three decades women entering the work force equality between the sexes the need for two incomes to pay the bills even courts that favor shared custody after divorce and it is what many would agree is fair even ideal yet it is anything but the norm
2514468 ive interviewed many people who became parents in their 30s and 40s who said that parenthood revealed to them how selfish and silly they had been in their teens and 20s and i think that definitely applies to me
2514469 both partners have moments of uncertainty over making the right decision for their child but it may be that some dads need a little extra cheerleading is because culturally the fathers role in caring for an infant isnt as well defined as the mothers
2514470 a growing body of evidence shows that same sex couples have a great deal to teach everyone else about marriage and relationships

2514503 unless expressly granted authority by statute a local governmental entitys passage of such an ordinance would be in contravention of the states home rule law
2514504 the state has preempted the field of regulating moving traffic violations including the violation of running a red light
2514505 state traffic regulations apply throughout indiana the general assembly has defined the offense of disregarding a traffic control signal and has set the penalty as a class c infraction therefore a local ordinance imposing a penalty for running a red light would result in an attempt to regulate conduct that is already regulated by a state agency in contravention of the states home rule law

2514548 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2514549 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2514550 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2514551 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2514552 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city

2514554 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

2514557 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2514689 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2514690 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2514691 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2514692 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2514693 shes laughin harder shes slappin the arm of the chair shes so happy i look over at bill cosby again i dont know what hes talkin about but i know its got power
2514694 comedy wasnt a career it wasnt even a choice it was a calling god was telling me to make people laugh
2514695 i looked over and saw redd foxx and he was smiling and signaling
2514696 if you cleaned up your act you could be as big as cosby
2514697 you know how to tell if a persons poor you look in the fridge if theres nothing but baloney youre talkin serious poor

2514699 we are trying a lot of innovations with the marketing of drona apart from marketing through the conventional media we are concentrating heavily on the online medium because we believe it to be a strong carrier the internet allows you to reach out to so many people in india and around the world

2514706 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2514707 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2514708 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty
2514709 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2514710 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2514711 senator mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2514712 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2514713 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2514714 the fact that we have to deal with russia to deal with our most important national security challenges
2514715 the temperature of your rhetoric isnt a measure of your commitment to georgian sovereignty
2514716 you dont want to get so far in front of a situation that youre feeding the momentum of an escalation
2514717 mccain took an inflexible approach to addressing this issue by focusing heavily on one side without a pragmatic assessment of the situation
2514718 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2514719 john mccains top foreign policy advisor lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government

2514737 it has been good to sit together and build new friendships
2514738 in this dialogue we are not discussing doctrines or creeds
2514739 we are just trying to find common ground for religions to work together as intended by god
2514740 just as we promise to seek to move beyond the stereotyping of muslims found in the media can i ask you my muslim friends to get to know us beyond what is reported in the newspapers and television programs

2514752 listen to me o men of shechem that god may listen to you once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them and they said to the olive tree reign over us but the olive tree said to them shall i leave my fatness with which god and men are honored and go to wave over the trees then the trees said to the fig tree you come reign over us but the fig tree said to them shall i leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go to wave over the trees then the trees said to the vine you come reign over us but the vine said to them shall i leave my new wine which cheers god and men and go to wave over the trees finally all the trees said to the bramble you come reign over us and the bramble said to the trees if in truth you are anointing me as king over you come and take refuge in my shade but if not may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of lebanon now therefore if you have dealt in truth and integrity in making abimelech king and if you have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have dealt with him as he deserved for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of midian but you have risen against my fathers house today and have killed his sons seventy men on one stone and have made abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he is your relative if then you have dealt in truth and integrity with jerubbaal and his house this day rejoice in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you but if not let fire come out from abimelech and consume the men of shechem and beth millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from beth millo and consume abimelech

2514766 we have worked on the basis of tip off and specific information about their addresses we then started checking the identity cards and even election cards in some cases to find out the true identity it was a difficult operation for us as bangladeshis living in soni ni chali and rabari colony areas even assumed hindu names and their wives were performing daily puja so as to integrate with the local people

2514781 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2514782 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2514783 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2514784 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2514785 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2514789 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2514790 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2514791 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2514792 tivos advertising solutions continue to lead the industry enabling advertisers to reach an attractive demographic

2514798 bmw is breaking new ground with this revolutionary way to engage test drive viewers giving them a richer experience with bmws m line within the test drive program itself

2514839 till now we worked with perry teddy and other yg family members before but we worked with japanese dj and composer daishi dance an outside artist for the first time and no brain participated in featuring creating a more mature and deep music
2514840 we have nothing to hide so we arent too worried about it

2514849 a slight word of caution though perhaps we should all recall the boeing chinook acquisition fiasco a matter which i know that mick has taken a keen personal interest in and which in my biased view is largely attributable to mod and political incompetence
2514850 the origins of this awful failure were complex and manifold they stretched back through long years of peace and carelessness they could be traced through endless ramifications of administrative incapacity from the inherent faults of confused systems to the petty bunglings of minor officials from the inevitable ignorance of cabinet ministers to the exactitudes of narrow routine in the inquiries which followed it was clearly shown that the evil was in reality that worst of all evils one which has been caused by nothing in particular and for which no one in particular is to blame the whole organisation of the war machine was incompetent and out date there was an extraordinary overlapping of authorities an almost incredible shifting of responsibilities to and fro
2514851 errors follies and vices on the part of individuals there doubtless were
2514852 but in the general reckoning they were of small account insignificant symptoms of the deep disease of body politic the enormous calamity of administrative collapse

2514860 the object was traveling to the southeast on a direct course towards the crawford ranch also known as president bushs western white house
2514861 the last time the object was seen on radar at it was continuing on a direct path to crawford ranch and was only 10 miles away during the entire episode of over an hour there is no indication that any of the military jets reacted to this unknown craft
2514862 radar detects an object at 7 20 p m only 2 8 miles south southwest of the constables home and traveling in a southeastern direction
2514863 this matches very well with the time and direction of the constables sighting at radar shows the object suddenly veering to the north at 1 900 miles per hour and then returning a minute later to continue on its southeastern course

2514866 there is nothing in the constitution that says the governor general is relieved from making an appointment because he or she has not received advice from someone the responsibility still remains under the constitution that is the ultimate guarantee that the senate would not be allowed to whither away

2514878 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2514879 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2514880 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2514881 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2514882 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2514883 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2514884 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2514885 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2514911 there is absolutely no point in collecting intelligence unless it is going to be used

2514919 billy ray hearn has influenced the direction of church music in many ways he contributed to the first youth musicals signed many of the first and biggest artists in the contemporary christian music genre and produced groundbreaking recordings
2514920 billy rays influence on the role of music in the church the music industry and the music heard on christian music radio is significant he has been faithful in giving back to baylor and he has influenced the next generation of young people
2514921 billy ray hearn has shown us what one minister of music can do to make a difference on a large scale
2514922 one minister of music can look at his choir and see the future of church music one minister of music can look out across his congregation and see the world one minister of music can say yes to gods call and open his heart to all of gods possibilities rather than placing limitations on that call billy ray hearn has shown us this
2514923 we also want our church music students to be aware of how baylor has contributed to the story of christian music and church music ministry
2514924 being a christian musician is not just a job baylor is not just another place to earn a degree in church music part of the story of church music especially baptist but not solely baptist runs through this campus

2514926 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
2514927 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
2514928 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
2514929 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
2514930 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
2514931 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
2514932 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
2514933 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
2514934 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
2514935 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

2514968 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2514969 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2514970 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2514971 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2514972 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2514973 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2514974 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2514975 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2515023 les unit s lectroniques remplissent semble t il une double fonction celle de faire constater un droit vis vis de l metteur et celle dapporter la preuve que le porteur du pme sur lequel sont enregistr es les unit s lectroniques est bien le titulaire de la cr ance les unit s lectroniques sont donc plus que de simples cr ances et lon doit pr f rer leur gard la qualification de titres au porteur que la doctrine saccorde appeler dor navant titres anonymes par opposition aux titres nominatifs les unit s lectroniques pr sentent en effet toutes les caract ristiques de titres anonymes incorpor s dans un support lectronique dont la circulation r alise un paiement lib ratoire

2515046 the gold standard has drawbacks of its own perhaps the most important of which is that it generated a certain amount of price level instability itself
2515047 in the united states as early as 1853 more than a half century before the federal reserve system came into existence private banks in the new york area formed an exchange and settlement system that economized on the movement of paper and settlement balances in 1970 some of these arrangements were automated and became the basis for a wire transfer system called the clearing house interbank payments system chips chips is still the leading clearing and settlement system for large dollar interbank payments originating in international trade and finance the fed created a goldwire system that involved inter district settlements through the gold settlement fund this system quickly gave way to a telegraphic system for adjusting reserve balances this system in turn evolved into a highly automated and centralized fedwire system to handle large volumes of high value payments settled in reserve balances on a real time basis the fedwire system is the key interbank system for federal funds market in the early 1970s a group of california commercial banks in cooperation with the reserve bank of san francisco organized an automated clearing system operating within the san francisco district a similar development occurred in the atlanta district with groups in other districts studying similar systems these efforts led to the creation of an automated clearing house ach throughout the entire federal reserve system the federal government along with some other large private employers began making some payroll deposits through this system in 1975
2515048 our systems and banking arrangements for handling high value dollar payments are all electronic and have been for many years banking records including those for loans and deposits have been computerized since the 1960s
2515049 the history of the automated clearing house provides a useful caution
2515050 the automated clearing house ach system makes payroll transfers electronically using a network to move funds from the employers account to the employees in the case of a payroll transfer the firm is the originator arranging with its bank to transfer funds to its employees account the firms bank assembles all the firms transfers regardless of transaction type payments for utilities or other services and sends an electronic message containing a list of transfers to the ach operator the operator electronically sorts the transfers to their various banking destinations not all payroll transfers go to the same bank and calculates the total of credits or dollar amounts that need to be transferred he or she sends an electronic message containing a list of the transfers to the various receiving banks including the employees bank or financial institution which then credits the employees account the ach operator is the key element in the process that clears and settles transactions between banks eliminating the need for bilateral relationships between financial institutions like a billing agent the operator informs the various banks that their accounts have credits or debits in the case of the payroll transfer the operator sends the firms bank an electronic notice to debit the amount of the payroll and also the employees bank of a credit the transaction is usually settled with finality on the next day when accounts are officially balanced with the proper funds in response to rapid increases in check volume in the 1960s and concerns about the cost of supporting future growth efficiently the ach payment mechanism was established in 1972 as an electronic alternative to the traditional paper based check collection system
2515051 indirectly convertible system in which the issuer s of currency undertake to convert their currency not into the nearly comprehensive basket as such but into some medium of exchange mor of the same value it promises a much higher degree of price stability
2515052 for years j s g boggs has suffered every manner of government intimidation because of his art he draws currency very beautiful currency which he calls boggs bills hes not trying to fool anyone and theres no mistaking them for dollars in fact they are much nicer looking than the treasurys new bills that feature overgrown heads of politicians and official graffiti of all sorts because boggs bills are both lovely and fun he quite often persuades merchants to accept his artistic creations in exchange for goods and services theyve even been known to give change in dollars the more famous he becomes the university of chicago has just published a book about him the more his art is in demand but far from getting a grant from the national endowment for the arts hes been subjected to three secret service raids the agency seized 1 300 bills from mr boggs home and despite the refusal of several courts to convict him of counterfeiting the government wont return his property
2515053 branded networks consist of group of providers that use a retail brand identification for marketing purposes and use the central organisation for establishing network operating rules business strategy and network operations in the case of e money a clearing house the central organization may ou may not be owned by members in the credit card market place visa and mastercard are owned by their members while american express and discover card are owned by single organizations that provide a stand alone network to compete against the larger visa mastercard networks

2515072 the report of the ncps stated that the american public is being exposed to many unreasonably hazardous products
2515073 the atomistic consumer is pitted against a seller who is cast in the role of a powerful and impersonal adversary
2515074 further the post accident remedies to compensate victims of product related accidents are inadequate and encourage the continued production of unsafe products it is believed that a shift in the assignment of liability for accident costs from consumers to sellers would discourage sales of the more hazardous product grades thereby reducing the frequency and severity of home accidents
2515075 with respect to product safety the ncps report flatly rejects the option of laissez faire
2515076 the nation presently incurs a substantial cost as the result of product related accidents some of the accidents are undoubtly caused by unreasonably hazardous products the commission concluded that the post accident remedies available to consumers in the form of compensation for damages were judged to be inadequate and encouraged manufacturers to continue the production and sale of unsafe products
2515077 it was further concluded that competitive market forces better product information and industry self regulation would fail to provide consumers with
2515078 in order to see if similar conclusions can be extended to the product safety problem it is instructive briefly to review arrows model arrow constructs the norm of an ideal competitive equilibrium under uncertainty in this ideal world the marginal cost of information is zero and transactions are costless risk averse individuals maximize their expected utilities by demanding full insurance coverage against all conceivable risks in a sense arrow has independently reestablished the coase theorem namely with zero information and transaction costs market forces will lead to an optimal allocation of resources but information is costly and imperfect and consumers cannot turn to insurance carriers for all imaginable risks the moral hazard administrative costs and inadequate third party controls over payment of benefits and costs are some of the reasons identified by arrow to explain why insurance markets have not been developed for all risks with respect to medical care he seems to believe that a nonmarket agency could greatly reduce these insurance costs and by achieving widespread coverage through compulsion the agency could eliminate these uncertainty costs thereby putting risk averse consumers in a preferred position calabresi 1970 offers several reasons supporting the thesis that private insurance markets typically achieve less than some optimal level

2515086 viewed from an ex ante perspective there is a net loss in social welfare from this increased prior knowledge
2515087 in fact if markets are created for every commodity for every contingency then the general competitive equilibrium leads to an efficient allocation of risk bearing arrow 1953 debreu 1953 1959 chapter vii the existence of competitive equilibrium with universal contingent contracts follows by suitable reinterpretation of the usual existence results even if the markets only exist for some contingencies it is a matter of some controversy how to represent the concept of uncertainty the most usual doctrine represents uncertainty by probabilities and i shall follow that convention here

2515099 il me semble quun telle r gle constitue la seule solution r alisable et notre port e si nous voulons faire de la politique mon taire un des piliers de notre soci t libre et non une menace pour ses fondations
2515100 si lon veut pallier les d fauts majeurs du syst me de cr dit il convient de le r former profond ment cette r forme doit sappuyer sur deux principes fondamentaux
2515101 certains pourront dire quune conomie monnaie stable serait pr f rable une conomie recourant un syst me dindexation g n ralis e mais une longue exp rience montre quil na jamais t possible dassurer la stabilit de la valeur de la monnaie il importe de bien comprendre la nature du syst me dindexation g n ralis e qui est propos il ne sagit pas denserrer l conomie dans un syst me de contraintes incompatibles et impossibles supporter il sagit simplement de r tablir pleinement le principe de lhonn tet des contrats en en assurant un application tout la fois efficace et quitable
2515102 on trouve de bonnes choses sur la monnaie dans ces anciens auteurs ils ont vu mieux les faits que certains conomistes modernes lesquels semblent plus soucieux de se concilier la bienveillance des gens qui mettent les fausses monnaies voire m me des propri taires des mines dargent que de rechercher seulement la v rit scientifique bodin tait absolument contraire aux missions de monnaie d pr ci es en 1542 scaruffi proposait que chaque pi ce de monnaie port t lindication de son poids et de son titre j b say demandait quon abol t les noms de franc cu etc pour substituer lindication du poids et du titre cela aurait t en effet un bon rem de pour les anciennes alt rations des monnaies mais maintenant on a perfectionn cet art par l mission de papier monnaie

2515105 il faut faire ici une observation que nous aurons lieu de r p ter maintes fois et cest que les mesures prises pour obtenir un b n fice en alt rant l quilibre conomique ont deux sortes deffets les premiers de ces effets sont ceux quon a directement en vue ils consistent dans le transfert de la richesse de certaines personnes certaines autres les secondes qui accompagnent n cessairement les premi res consistent en une perte s che de richesse dans une destruction de biens conomiques

2515123 ce syst me dabailard a re u le nom de conceptualisme il consiste dire que les universaux ne sont ni des r alit s comme le veulent les r alistes ni de simples mots comme le pr tendent les nominalistes mais des conceptions de lintelligence qui ayant observ la ressemblance que plusieurs individus ont entre eux r sume ces ressemblances en une notion quelle tend tous ces individus il ny a dans limmense domaine des cr atures ou des choses n es rien qui ne soit essentiellement individuel ou qui ne prenne n cessairement la forme de lindividualit les qualit s g n rales elles m mes nont de r alit que dans les individus qui les poss dent mais en face des choses individuelles il y a la pens e qui per oit leurs rapports qui d gage ce quelles ont de commun et qui engendre ainsi les notions de genre et desp ce en un mot les universaux
2515124 aux termes des canons de leglise la personne dun clerc tout colier acqu rait ce titre avec la licence tait inviolable se porter des voies de fait envers un clerc c tait commettre un crime qui entrainait lexcommunication et que le pape seul pouvait absoudre

2515130 quant l tymologie du nom de luniversit il faut la chercher dans le sens du mot latin universitas qui au moyen ge repr sentait une r union une cat gorie de personnes une corporation ainsi dans les actes et mandements publi s au nom des coles de paris on employait la formule ordinaire noverit universitas vestra cest dire sachez tous autant que vous tes et cette formule qui sappliquait tous les protocoles figurait aussi en t te de tous les dipl mes man s des ma tres et adress s aux l ves
2515131 on comprend que le mot universitas prenant peu peu un sens sp cial ou restreint finit par d signer particuli rement luniversit ou la totalit des tudiants puis linstitution universitaire elle m me que formaient ces tudiants et enfin le vaste quartier de la ville qui leur tait presque exclusivement r serv sur la rive gauche de la seine
2515132 les quatre nations r unies constitu rent dabord luniversit des tudes plus tard une nouvelle division s tablit selon lordre des tudes de chaque nation et les facult s prirent naissance

2515136 1212 le pape prend position en faveur des ma tres il reconnait leur association et conserve au chancelier le droit de d cerner la licence denseignement et lui r serve la collation du titre mais le tient dy proc der si le jury des ma tres le juge bon

2515463 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2515464 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2515465 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2515466 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2515467 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2515468 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2515469 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2515470 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2515479 memang betapa sulitnya untuk mencintai dan kadang terjadi kesalahan dan kehilangan yang diakibatkan oleh cinta dalam cinta inilah jika engkau datang kepadanya tanpa keraguan dan penuh harapan memungkinkan cinta menjadi mungkin bagimu
2515480 akan tetapi kehilangan emosi atau afeksi dapat menyebabkan kita berpikir bahwa cinta adalah utopia impian yang tidak mungkin tercapai
2515481 cinta adalah sebuah kemungkinan dan harapanku ini untuk membangkitkan kembali dalam ini diri setiap kita letak masa depan dan harapan kemanusiaan dalam sebuah cinta ada kebenaran iman dan kekuatan seuntai cinta menebarkan kedamaian dan kegembiraan cinta ibarat harapan yang sanggup menghantar orang buta bersama sama mengijinkan mereka menggapai kebebasan dan ketertarikan satu dengan yang lain
2515482 marilah kita pergi dalam perziarahan panjang bersama melalui tiga tahap

2515508 apposito elaborato da cui si evinca per ogni singola opera lo stato di avanzamento e la relativa copertura indicando specificatamente le fonti di finanziamento e le reali previsioni di spesa
2515509 writing is a kind of complex social practice involving a specific point of view on selected materials
2515510 what each author says individually already constitutes a common action and what he or she says or does is necessarily political
2515511 their sensibility the poets from 1905 to 1955 which loves freedom above all is inherently anti ideological even against the very grain of thought
2515512 through poetry after the mastery of its medium and its tradition the filipino writer in english has his revenge as it were on the ideology the very way of thinking and feeling which the adopted language secretes english in filipino hands under the pressure of his own milieu and sensibility becomes not english but filipino if he is at first possessed he comes also in time to possess both the medium and the message in his own way by the language of his own blood
2515513 i dont know why i went into it literary criticism this literary criticism does it have any validity
2515514 the philosophy of a period cannot be any one individual or tendentious system it is the totality of all the individual or tendentious philosophies plus scientific opinions plus religion and plus common sense
2515515 remnants of mechanicalism still persist since theory is spoken of as a complement an accessory of practice as an ancillary of practice
2515516 gregarious congenial person and a gracious host the filipino really lives two lives one gets to know the filipino when he goes beneath the surface when he knows him in his family setting
2515517 despite this general apparent homogeneity the modern philippines continues to be characterized by cultural linguistic and racial complexity
2515518 sometimes strangely western sometimes familiarly asian always neither one nor the other in fact even filipinos themselves are in a quandary about their own identity
2515519 this adaptation of parsonian structural functionalism ignores power relations grounded on property and the political economy of the uneven formation in particular it obscures if not hides completely the profound extent of u s control of the economic political and military institutions that determine elections and the techniques of governance
2515520 a very peculiar mass a heterogeneous compound of inefficient humanity a jumble of save tribes that cried for order and pacification
2515521 strategic essentialism whereby the signifiers of indigenous native cultures are privileged in a process of negative discrimination
2515522 much of the strategy for discovering sp is based on assessing historical and socio cultural realities understanding the local language unraveling filipino characteristics and explaining them through the eyes of the native filipino the principal emphasis of sp is to foster national identity and consciousness
2515523 to argue that utang na loob is a filipino value is therefore misleading to say the least and dangerous at best utang na loob would be convenient in perpetuating the colonial status of the filipino mind
2515524 the uncomfortable feeling that accompanies awareness of being in a socially unacceptable position or performing a socially unacceptable action
2515525 what makes sikolohiyang pilipino different is its intense pursuit of developing the indigenous national culture and its program of using the indigenous language in its conferences research teaching and publication
2515526 the dualist centralized world of the double east west hegemony is fragmenting politically and culturally but the homogeneity of capitalism remains as intact and as systematic as ever
2515527 philippine psychologys colonial character as a captive of an american dominated english speaking world
2515528 the value of affirming the peculiarity and distinctiveness of man as a sociocultural being
2515529 to develop a national culture which though western dominated considers the aspirations of the filipino through the discovery and use of indigenous concepts and methods sp is contributing to a truly universal psychology which is based on a new set of principles diversity and equality
2515530 the filipino is a blend of east and west the western influence can be seen more in external ways dressing liking for hamburger and other food western music and dance etc however the internal aspect which is at the core of his pagkatao personality is asian deference for authority modesty humility concern for others etc
2515531 it is clearly possible to be objective i e scientific about either emic or etic phenomena similarly it is equally possible to be subjective about either emic or etic phenomena objectivity is the epistemological status that distinguishes the community of observers from communities that are observed while it is possible for those who are observed to be objective this can only mean that they have temporarily or permanently joined the community of observers by relying on an operationalized scientific epistemology
2515532 r eference to cultural distinctions within filipino society does not imply a fragmented philippine society rather the distinctions in the culture of the people provide a challenge to psychological research and a rich base for a truly national culture
2515533 big and little people social class in the rural philippines
2515534 sikolohiyang pilipino filipino psychology a legacy of virgilio g enriquez
2515535 against a psychology used for the exploitation of the masses
2515536 greater emphasis on the collective experience of a people with a common bond of history
2515537 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office

2515549 jika anda merasa lebih utama dari maryam aisyah atau fatimah hanya karena engkau lelaki dan mereka wanita maka orang yang mengatakan hal itu pantas disebut orang bodoh
2515550 sebagian orang mengatakan mencintai wanita adalah bencana padahal bencana sesungguhnya adalah berdekat dengan lelaki yang jauh dari cinta dan hasrat seorang wanita
2515551 tidak diketahui sesuatu yang begitu diperhatikan dan mantap pada diri seorang wanita melebihi cinta
2515552 tidak dapat dipungkiri bahwa mengabaikan wanita berarti mengabaikan setengah potensi masyarakat dan melecehkannya berarti melecehkan seluruh manusia karena tidak seorang manusia pun kecuali adam dan hawa yang tidak lahir melalui seorang perempuan
2515553 mencintai seorang wanita mencukupi seorang lelaki tapi untuk memahaminya seribu lelaki pun belum cukup

2515621 just as importantly my dad was deeply interested and devoted to mentoring succeeding generations in the real estate industry his commitment is reflected in the fact that the senior executive team at the alter group has been intact for more than 25 years he always found time for anyone who wanted to learn whether a colleague a reporter or a recent college graduate
2515622 in addition to his professional accomplishments he was equally proud of his family and his significant philanthropic work s first brokers to market raw land to residential developers

2515653 on this day we too etch in our hearts the voices faces and forms that vanished in the hell no hibakusha can ever forget renewing our determination that no one else should ever suffer as we did
2515654 because the effects of that atomic bomb still eating away at the minds and bodies of the hibakusha have for decades been so underestimated a complete picture of the damage has yet to emerge most severely neglected have been the emotional injuries therefore the city of hiroshima is initiating a two year scientific exploration of the psychological impact of the a bomb experience

2515657 africa progress panel responds to the g8 summit in hokkaido
2515658 g8 countries have done little to show how they will fund the shortfall of us 40 billion in programmable aid and debt relief identified by the africa progress panel last month the g8 has yet to present clear timetables outlining future aid provision or to provide increased transparency required to improve the quality of aid
2515659 the panel welcomes the commitment of us 10 billion to support food aid and measures to increase agricultural input as a necessary first step more needs to be done however to increase the supply of food to the worlds most vulnerable citizens and immediate measures must be taken to relax export restrictions on commodities such as rice
2515660 the panel welcomes the g8 leaders commitment to the conclusion of an ambitious balanced and comprehensive doha agreement as wto negotiations enter this crucial period all parties need to understand that the attainment of the millennium development goals rest in large part on the ability of the continent to trade its way out of poverty
2515661 the success in supporting african development will not only result in tangible benefits for her people but ensure a more secure and prosperous future for the world for g8 leaders helping africa to help itself is not a question of altruism it is a matter of self interest

2515711 i might take you up on your kind offer of course i didnt know i could walk between worlds they must have inadvertently opened a door inside my brain when i visited the institute of hugely important studies for a series of psychic tests im certainly feeling cleverer and cleverer with every passing second perhaps in time i might achieve the level of genius or perhaps its nothing more than the lovely clean air you have here i dont know but thats by the by what do we do next
2515712 youre local answer me this to which location do you suggest we transport ourselves next food shelter and a safe refuge from an inevitable pursuit by the lawmen of weasels pit would be a prerequisite

2515723 so lets just carry on to the abbey and forget everything i said shall we
2515724 i love you and i desire great things for you but i god am the one with the ultimate plan not you

2515729 so how do we get inside without drawing too much attention to ourselves can anyone pick a lock or utter a magical incantation that actually works
2515730 quite inadvertently you have made a significant statement i should be able to see your private parts at least in silhouette
2515731 she aint got no willy gals aint allowed in abbeys its a male preserve they can be law masters and stuff but they cant be priests of the wheel we gotta dress her up as a boy

2515738 only the most naturally occurring and locally produced excremento i assure you
2515739 we could always strip off the filth encrusted finery and bury it in the woods shes still nice and clean underneath
2515740 no ones going near my finery youd better believe it my finerys as much me as say my nose is or my reproductive organs id feel naked id feel violated im telling ya right now it aint gonna happen
2515741 you would still have your body armour and arrow proof codpiece
2515742 margarita hummingbird as your owner and heir to the throne of er the condom purveyors guild i order you to shed your soiled finery and join us within the walls of this edifice
2515743 my name is abbot dunnock farley dunnock before that well known for my piety and devotion to the wheel who are you
2515744 brother dos fresas please show these gentlehamsters to the guest quarters
2515745 if you can stand a little honesty which im sure you can because youre in that sort of game this cell is horrible ive slept in more comfortable ditches ive snagged my testes on barbed wire fences that were silkier than this blanket and as regards to this palliasse well it should be renamed sore ass
2515746 but you would know nothing of this you are stix sleep well breakfast is served when the sparrow crows or the wild weasel farts whichever comes first or is the loudest or best gains our attention hasta luego
2515747 im not much into social studies and stuff so please forgive my ignorance but what is the wheel spokes and sticks
2515748 in fact its the only one thats allowed actually its more than a religion its a control mechanism over the people of this benighted land it has effectively subjugated the masses to meet the needs of the powerful few the principle is that all life revolves upon a wheel at the hub is our most base instincts at the rim lays the place to which we should all aspire perfection in rodent form the monks and priests are 48 the spokes that bind them together and supposedly help us climb from the depths of the hub to the eternal righteousness of the rim the law masters are there to make sure we dont slip back down again i hate it i hate the whole hypocritical stink hole of it all even if it did stop the inter rodent wars and create rodent union that was just a lucky side effect it makes me so angry that i want to take a stick to my own genitals
2515749 why would the law master of weasels pit get her knickers in a twist over capturing a few stix doesnt she approve of self flagellation
2515750 stix are like sticks in a wheel they tend to bugger things up
2515751 hence my dunking in lake effluence if it hadnt been for my hamstery cheek pouches i would have drowned she may not have admitted it but the law master was effectively having me executed
2515752 next time i see her im gonna stomp that furry arsed momma into the ground you see if i dont
2515753 terrible eyesight fabulous hearing full of shit so it was a troubled joan bugler that finally slipped into a dream filled slumber her last coherent thought was bugger those institute people i was happier being a simple custard packer i should have stayed home and played tiddly winks with the strange uncle roger oh why did they have to discover i had a stupid talent that could lead me into danger and possibly death bugger them all to hamster hell
2515754 my childrens books are an extension of my work as a painter writing is a new addition for me but i am enjoying it very much and creating the illustrations is a perfect way to continue my painting in a new direction and a nice way to complement my writing i hope to write and illustrate many more
2515755 first they decided to fly through space then lucy became a ballerina on a big stage with bright lights seymour rode his motorcycle through the rolling green mountains
2515756 anyway as i was saying to the miniscule rootley farnham and it
2515757 the dunk master can shove his dunking chair right up his arse i mean think about it its not even logical surely dunking my puny body into the stinky waters of lake effluence with its multitude of diseases shit and hamster eating pike cannot possibly prove that i am anything but an average hamster who firmly believes in the teachings of the wheel its so obvious that even a blithering moron could see it and anyone who thinks it isnt and can mount a reasonable counter argument can go stick their privates in the mangle sideways
2515758 and eloquent too but it will do you no good boy for if the fishy wishies dont eat you and your lungs do not give up their air too freely it will only condemn you then youll hang from the gallows for a week where the midges can feast gleefully upon your soft tissues
2515759 its not like youre all surprised or anything everyone knows that weasels pit has a well trained toad as its dunk master and an ugly bastard one at that
2515760 into the dunking chair accused scum quickly or ill wrap my enormous tongue about your nether regions and crush you to a pulp
2515761 do your worst loathsome beast youll not better me i curse the wheel
2515762 young farnham is a witch after all es gone and made imself all eavy sos e can sink to the bottom and evade the justice of the wheel by wallowin in the ooze
2515763 the word is warlock and would you please refrain from dropping your aitches but i take your point drowning is an excellent means to save yourself from the gallows but itll do him no good whatsoever justice will prevail ill see to that
2515764 he might ave turned imself into a pike sos e can swim away and thumb is nose at us at a later date and probably from quite some distance too
2515765 i do believe we are witnessing a primitive form of law enforcement for surely it is not justice that we see practiced here
2515766 but should we sit and fret why aint ya doing something about it
2515767 do you really think so it would be ever so daring wouldnt it but might we not risk some dreadful wounding from the lawmens crossbows
2515768 but underneath all this flappy finery theres a chain mail blanket even this female equivalent of a codpiece that im wearing is armoured aint nothing gonna hurt me 24 unless i take a bolt straight up the jacksey and what are the chances of that
2515769 i had that codpiece especially made for you i call it a minge piece it fits perfectly
2515770 yes and i shall wear the armour of righteousness to protect me come dear gallant margarita the bravest female cavy in all of spanx we gallop toward our destiny
2515771 we waddle with all this crap on my back the only way im gonna build up any speed is by jumping off a cliff i dont see one any place nearby so we waddle toward our destiny
2515772 what you doin with young rootley farnham do you intend to ave your wicked way with im in one of the back room of the stoat and wanger im not bein conscious too its unforgivable you scarlet 27 hussy you now put im down this instant
2515773 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2515774 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2515775 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2515776 kenapa yah nggak dibuka buka ini jalan padahal udah jadi

2515778 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2515779 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2515780 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2515781 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2515782 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2515783 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2515784 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2515785 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2515790 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2515791 the reason why we come here is we hope to attract folks to government service
2515792 and if we cant get you in service then we want partnerships on working on security issues
2515793 its people like yourselves that understand the threat that need to come into the government and help us address this problem
2515794 we did a very broad distribution of information and also had engineers on call for a period of time and advertised that fact so people could call in and ask questions about the issue
2515795 the nice thing about sharing information with other people is they share info with us
2515796 we cant stand in an ivory tower and say were us cert we want to be seen as a place where you can come for information on security
2515797 so its very important that there is little to no chance that it can be interfered with
2515798 when it comes to a specific country attacking the u s i wont comment however we have identified those countries that we consider to have capabilities that could impact our national security
2515799 some exceed our skills some countries are noisier in their techniques
2515800 i worry about the ones that arent hitting our sensors so yes there are countries knocking on our door daily and it does pose a threat to our national security

2515813 i read a poem once about a little white bird that came to rest on a window sill and the lady who lived in the house began to put out food for it soon the lady fell in love but it was a mismatched love everyday the little bird came to the window and the lady put out food when the love affair was over the little white bird never returned but the woman went on puttin out the crumbs every day for years and the wind just blew them away

2515817 but i dont like having to walk beside you while you push yourself
2515818 do you think ive liked having to sit helpless in your boat every weekend for the past two months
2515819 i never realized that amy youre in a wheelchair all the time i never thought youd mind sitting in the boat its the same thing
2515820 it is not the same thing in this chair i can move by myself i can go anywhere i need to go that boat traps me so i cant do anything i couldnt even save myself if something happened and i fell out
2515821 but im there dont you think i could save you or help you move or whatever it is you want
2515822 yes but charles the point is ive spent twelve years learning to manage by myself i even live in a city thats miles from my family so ill have to be independent and do things for myself being placed in the boat takes all that ive wonaway from me cant you see why i object to it i cant let myself be at anyones mercy not even yours
2515823 amy i need to have you dependent upon me i need your dependence upon me
2515824 you must let it go free you must let it go free
2515825 nu este poate controlul direct al regiunii dar in orice caz moscova vrea sa demonstreze ca aceasta regiune este in continuare instabila si deci nu poate fi o alternativa serioasa pentru tranzitul de hidrocarburi asupra caruia rusia pretinde in prezent ca detine monopolul
2515826 acest conflict ar trebui sa fie o mare miza pentru europeni deoarece este pusa in joc securitatea lor energetica
2515827 rusia a devastat complet portul poti de la marea neagra important pentru transportul de resurse energetice de la marea caspica si care se afla in apropierea oleoductului baku supsa si a terminalului petrolier supsa
2515828 if i can become the chief minister of indias most populous state four times and this time entirely on my own without anyone elses support then why cant i become the countrys prime minister
2515829 if you pose this question to my casteist political adversaries they will have no answer to this because they cannot see a dalits daughter rising to such heights
2515830 these parties felt most threatened when my name was proposed for prime ministership during the course of the upa governments trust vote in parliament so both the nda and upa decided to gang up and save the central government
2515831 well i should express my gratitude to these very parties as the profile enhancement that the bsp witnessed over a span of just six or seven days was something we would have otherwise taken six or seven years to achieve
2515832 realising that the rise of the bsp was a direct threat to them the congress led upa was looking for new ways and means to run me down and the latest in the series was implicating me in the disproportionate assets case that has been speeded up particularly after i refused to support them during the trust vote
2515833 my supporters are aware that all the wealth and property i have acquired actually consists of the gifts i have received on my birthdays and nearly rs 30 crores rs 300 million out of that has been given away as income tax yet the government is trying to harass me by cooking up false cases
2515834 i am sure my supporters are not going to get affected by such falsehood and campaigns launched by my adversaries
2515835 while the bjp began to hound me by fabricating cases in the name of the taj corridor the congress left no stone unturned in attempting to tarnish my image by letting loose the cbi to concoct cases against me
2515836 the congress leadership wanted to send me to jail so as soon as i learnt about their conspiracy i moved the supreme court and i am confident of getting justice from there
2515837 what finally led me to withdraw support to the upa government was their utter neglect of uttar pradesh for which they were not willing to pay any heed to our repeated demand for a special package of rs 80 000 crores rs 800 billion
2515838 on the contrary we extended full support to them to elect their own president
2515839 dont get disheartened even if i lose the case in the apex court and the congress succeeds in its design to send me to jail on trumped up corruption charges
2515840 the successor i have chosen for myself is someone 18 to 20 years younger to me and hails from my own chamar community
2515841 but let me make it absolutely clear that he is not anyone belonging to my family
2515842 i have penned down his name in a sealed packet left in the safe custody of two of my close confidantes
2515843 these two people have been told to open the packet and disclose the name of this successor either in the event of my sudden death or if my political adversaries succeed in their vicious gameplan of sending me to jail on trumped up charges
2515844 pure desh mein mach gaya shor haathi chala dilli ki oar
2515845 babasaheb aur kanshi ram ka mission adhoora behen ji karengi poora
2515846 when i can become the chief minister of the most populous state four times why can i not not become the prime minister of the country even if i am born in a dalit family
2515847 i am doubly proud of being a dalit and indian as also the fact that i am managing the state better than the previous governments
2515848 according to an internal nasa memo cpas cluster development test 2 cdt2 experienced a test failure on 31 july 2008 initial observations indicated that the programmer parachute did not inflate properly when the parachute test vehicle ptv separated from the test pallet the programmer parachute puts the ptv into the proper position and thus sets up proper initial conditions for descent to the ground in this test the programmer parachute failed to inflate this was due to the fact that the programmer parachute did not take in enough air to fully inflate and produce the proper drag this situation occurred because of hard buffeting produced by the wake formed by the ptv and the stabilization parachutes
2515849 you mentioned the gun position ive been talking about the second amendment being an individual right for the last year and a half so there wasnt a shift there
2515850 i dont want to join the government but workers of samajwadi party think we well benefit if i join the government
2515851 accept the leadership of congress under soniaji and the administrative leadership of manmohan singh whether i remain inside or outside the cabinet
2515852 i cannot duplicate the style of the left in supporting the government
2515853 i am not keen i am not dying for it but i am not disinterested either
2515854 the local congress up pradesh congress committee is interested for a pre poll alliance
2515855 el ppc est intentando mimetizar la estrategia que ha seguido el psoe en catalu a
2515856 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behavior
2515857 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2515858 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2515859 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2515860 beijing is covered in skyscrapers and filled with cars and the people of china have more connections to the world than ever before
2515861 well thats debatable they let me drop two subjects in return for showing up i dont know but it seemed like a good idea at the time anyway make sure you do alright in your exams so then even if you screw your life up youve got something to fall back on
2515862 yes shes planning on changing her name after the wedding
2515863 is this as utterly weird to you as it is to me

2515867 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2515868 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2515869 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2515870 quality versus quantity we are focused there on remediating and reforming the police forces that currently exist
2515871 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2515872 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2515873 we are looking for options and ways we can streamline the command and control arrangements for us forces in afghanistan making them more efficient and effective
2515874 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
2515875 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
2515876 as a nation we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas well be consuming from resources here at home
2515877 the totally convinced and the totally stupid have too much in common for the resemblance to be accidental
2515878 take as their sole responsibility the enforcement of laws made by the peoples elected representatives judges who can be relied upon to respect the values of the people whose rights laws and property they are sworn to defend
2515879 we expect if the situation stays the same that our income will be more than 70 billion this year
2515880 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
2515881 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
2515882 we expect if the situation stays the same that our income will be more than 70 billion this year
2515883 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
2515884 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
2515885 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
2515886 there is no magic number of soldiers that are needed on the ground to win this campaign
2515887 what we need is security of the people we need governance we need reconstruction and development
2515888 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
2515889 what we want to do is make sure we are prepared for any surprises were prepared for anything that might happen that might be a threat so in the early part of this year the dia started to look into how we could
2515890 the day i concluded that full fair and open trials were not possible under the current system
2515891 his f cking trolls are responsible for the enron loophole
2515892 people are tired of big corporations lobbyist and special interests who they feel prosper at their expense
2515893 provide compelling set of programming and surrogate activity to drive media interest
2515894 mobilize economists in target states supporting the mccain plan to engage the media in support of our plan
2515895 citizens for legitimate government whenever they discuss the president put in brackets the p so it is the resident so ive adopted that as my own standard
2515896 we want either a hammer or a fire to break the spell or dissolve the ice
2515897 religion has become the spirit of civil society of the sphere of egoism of bellum omnium contra omnes war of all against all it is no longer the essence of community but the essence of difference it has become the expression of mans separation from his community from himself and from other men as it was originally it is only the abstract avowal of specific perversity private whimsy and arbitrariness
2515898 immovably they insist on the very ideology which enslaves them the misplaced love of the common people for the wrong which is done them is a greater force than the cunning of the authorities
2515899 i come from florida where you and others participated in what i call the united states coup d tat we need to make sure that it does not happen again over and over again after the election when you stole the election you came back here and said get over it
2515900 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2515901 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2515902 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2515903 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist
2515904 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
2515905 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
2515906 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2515907 now that theyve met me they can see i dont have two horns and a tail
2515908 well study the seriousness of that decision and it depends on what this agreement brings us
2515909 our reaction will depend on how serious the american decision is when there is no more occupation there will be no need for these cells
2515910 i think it was most appropriate for judge giles to take action regarding defendant kilpatricks bond considering his most recent behavior
2515911 this was the most extreme option and were obviously going to appeal the trip to canada was taken on the basis that if the deal fell through a significant number of city employees would lose their jobs
2515912 someone in a segregation box is actually observed more than those anywhere else
2515913 their care and custody does not change simply because they are in segregation
2515914 there are concerns that they could be used in places where the detainees are enclosed in extremely hot conditions it is important to know whether or not detainees are provided with food
2515915 we are able to capture threats to the iraqi government and the population detain them rehabilitate them and 99 times out of 100 release them
2515916 weve made remarkable progress there and i would just say it looks as though the glidepath is on continuing to reduce the population because of the success were having within these camps
2515917 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2515918 canada has sought assurances that mr khadr under our government will be treated humanely
2515919 its yet another attempt by mr khadrs lawyers to avoid trial
2515920 now we know that the canadian government has known about facilitated and helped cover up the torture and abuse of a canadian citizen
2515921 this is no longer just a matter of government policy
2515922 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
2515923 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2515924 i call on the russian federation to stop bombing peaceful georgian towns
2515925 we have mobilised thousands of reservists i ask you not to be afraid of the attacks
2515926 we want to give time to the remaining civilians to leave tskhinvali
2515927 we are in full control of the capital city fighting is on the city limits
2515928 russia must interfere in the conflict to stop the violence russia must consider a military operation because our peacekeeping contingent will not be enough to ensure peace in the region
2515929 the security council will consider as soon as possible proposals to settle the situation in the region
2515930 this is the third time u s forces have detained ali al mashhadani without charge
2515931 the military has never substantiated any wrongdoing by him the authorities must make evidence against him public or release him immediately
2515932 has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
2515933 one brigade of georgian forces is in iraq and we are calling it home tomorrow
2515934 weapons are to be exclusively in the hands of one group the resistance group
2515935 now our stance is to watch the political developments and the security agreement we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
2515936 its premature to say what the aspiration goals and time horizons are going to be
2515937 the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the election law
2515938 the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2515939 there is no magic number of soldiers that are needed on the ground to win this campaign
2515940 what we need is security of the people we need governance we need reconstruction and development
2515941 unless you stabilize that border with pakistan and uproot the terrorist safe haven that has developed in the pakistan tribal areas youre not going to be able to stabilize afghanistan
2515942 ninety percent of the worlds opium comes from afghanistan and much of that money ends up in the hands of warlords and other militants
2515943 there is a clear linkage between narco trafficking and financing of the insurgency
2515944 there is a sense of commitment from those troops and when they go in for the fight they go in with everything theyve got
2515945 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2515946 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2515947 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2515948 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2515949 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2515950 i think furious would be a good way to describe it she didnt understand we both went through a process of trying to figure out how it happened why it happened
2515951 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2515952 none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2515953 the past and ongoing nature of khadrs treatment shocks the conscience of the canadian public
2515954 on some occasions the interrogators brought barking dogs into the interrogation room while my head was covered with a bag the bag was wrapped tightly around my neck nearly choking me and making it hard to breathe this terrified me
2515955 an interrogator gave me a pen and a paper and told me to write out my story while i was writing a u s military policeman came up to me turned around and farted in my face
2515956 the canadians called me a liar and i began to sob i told them that i was scared and that i had been tortured
2515957 all the other western democracies in the world have demanded and achieved the repatriation of their citizens out of guantanamo and the need to do this with respect to omar khadr is particularly acute given his age and the nature of the allegations raised against him
2515958 we are attempting to get the government of canada through the federal court to meet its obligations to a citizen
2515959 the respondents policy and decision with respect to khadr are patently unreasonable and perverse and were formulated in bad faith
2515960 its an attempt by mr khadrs lawyers to avoid a trial on the charges of murder in violation of the laws of the war attempted murder in violation of the laws of the war conspiracy providing material support for terrorism and spying
2515961 our position is the same as the previous liberal position mr khadr should face these charges through a trial process and not through a political process or through the media
2515962 we want to give time to the remaining civilians to leave tskhinvali
2515963 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
2515964 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean official used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
2515965 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
2515966 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
2515967 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
2515968 there is an irony here that the hardliners attempt to pressure the north koreans to give up the bomb in fact created circumstances where the north became a nuclear power and made the whole process of undoing their nuclear program much much harder than had they adopted a similar approach at the beginning
2515969 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
2515970 most difficult us housing market in more than 70 years
2515971 the taxpayer is stuck if they have to be bailed out
2515972 about 1 400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2515973 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2515974 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2515975 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2515976 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2515977 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
2515978 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
2515979 grave concern and it will certainly lead to retaliatory actions
2515980 general mckiernan is in the best possible position to most efficiently and effectively deploy all of the resources to the benefit of the overall mission
2515981 this creates one commander in charge of all forces and establishes a structure to deploy them as best suits the mission
2515982 it was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
2515983 i would like to apologise one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2515984 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2515985 a segment of the muslim population has declared war on our way of life
2515986 the bottom line is that he could poetically cause further terrorist attacks and should be detained indefinitely
2515987 despite being neither criminals entitled to a trial or legal combatants
2515988 he went to work for the rand corporation which sent him to vietnam to work on a study that involved interrogating vietcong prisoners whom he admired for the strength of their convictions he broke out in tears in court when telling of a prisoners reciting poetry to him
2515989 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
2515990 we are in very close contact with the israelis and we talk about the diplomatic track that were on
2515991 israelis have said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a touch edge to our diplomacy
2515992 if they provoke us or they attack us our army is prepared to attack and to succeed uncompromisingly
2515993 the monkeys and lions were drugged tossed into cloth sacks and dragged through smuggling tunnels under the border between egypt and the besieged gaza strip before ending up in a dusty gaza zoo
2515994 we talked to melba santana the wife of fellow prisoner alfredo dominguez batista she visited the prison and she was unable to see herrera but apparently the journalist herrera was able to smuggle her a note telling his condition
2515995 acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state
2515996 he who in the interest of a foreign state commits an act with the objective of damaging the independence or territorial integrity of the cuban state incurs the penalty of ten to twenty years imprisonment or death
2515997 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
2515998 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
2515999 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
2516000 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
2516001 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2516002 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2516003 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital
2516004 tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague whats montague it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man o be some other name whats in a name that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet
2516005 hein quoi je suis vraiment oblig pour les trucs bleus sur mes shoes
2516006 this india specific case at the iaea and the nsg is the first of its kind india is not a member of the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and india is a declared nuclear weaponry state so somehow we are confronted with an exceptional sort of a situation this is a very important issue not only for india but also for the world japan too
2516007 the legal heirs of the bhutto family are zulfikar junior fatima bhutto and sussui bhutto
2516008 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

2516018 saarc has been making steady and incremental progress over the years towards realizing the objectives of the saarc charter
2516019 i dont think ive given 6 16 the kind of look i can give it
2516020 the more experience i have looking at 6 16 the better off i will be in the long run going after it
2516021 i am really confident jumping in bad conditions like rain and wind
2516022 running in there without second guessing yourself without being worried about what bad things could happen opens up mentally some new doors and some good things can come out
2516023 theres just a lot of lower back strain that goes through our bodies

2516358 no terceiro caso toda a telemetria de controle isto tudo o que pode ser obtido do ambiente precisa fluir entre o terminal remoto do usu rio e o weblab nesse aspecto a rede de alto desempenho fundamental porque o experimento se d em tempo real e n o tolera atrasos

2516499 democrats will also lead the way for a new direction in iraq
2516500 i share the concern of my democratic colleagues that president bush may use his same failed logic to increase our troop strength in iraq by up to 30 000 soldiers
2516501 the iraqis need to understand that the responsibility for the future of that country is theirs
2516502 our troops have done everything asked of them in iraq with great courage particularly at this time of the year when families gather to celebrate the holiday season we need to remember the huge sacrifices being made by the brave men and women in our military and give thanks for their service

2516528 we declare pronounce and define that the doctrine which holds that the most blessed virgin mary in the first instance of her conception by a singular grace and privilege granted by almighty god in view of the merits of jesus christ the savior of the human race was preserved free from all stain of original sin is a doctrine revealed by god and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful
2516529 in view of the merits of jesus christ the savior of the human race
2516530 now with the exception of the holy virgin mary in regard to whom out of respect for the lord i do not propose to have a single question raised on the subject of sin after all how do we know what greater degree of grace for a complete victory over sin was conferred on her who merited to conceive and bring forth him who all admit was without sin to repeat then with the exception of this virgin if we could bring together into one place all those holy men and women while they lived here and ask them whether they were without sin what are we to suppose that they would have replied

2516537 its unbelievable its definitely a great relief for us because now we know that the radio telescope works the students were excited and shocked at the same time
2516538 its still early days but we will move on to bigger things we are going to increase the sensitivity of the system the radio telescope will be used for years to come

2516540 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

2516544 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2516545 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2516546 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2516547 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2516548 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2516549 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

2516551 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2516552 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2516553 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2516593 except for issues with palettes in spaces i havent encountered any problem with a cs3 application nor have i heard of any what problems certainly you dont have to use spaces for me the jury is still out whether the clutter reduction is worth the mental overhead to keep track of whats where in what space and why things are jumping around so much re michael hurleys question about downgrading current mac pros to 10 4 11 i did it only to find out that using two monitors was not supported either monitor could use either port but not both at the same time apple customer support says that the drivers for the new video cards were only in leopard btw 10 5 2 seemed to fix all the cs 3 issues at our plant to michael hurley i have cs3 design premium running on 10 5 2 just fine on my home intel mini thanks to the acrobat 8 1 2 update exporting to pdf works perfectly now that was my only issue with 10 5 and cs3 at work im still on a g5 dual 2 0 and 10 4 11 running cs3 we chose not to upgrade to 10 5 for other issues scanner printer etc from the reports i have read and from my own personal experience 10 5 2 has cleaned up the cs3 issues at least on my mac pro the only remaining issues were some tools that would not allow you to input the correct values ie cropping would not crop to the correct ratio there were work arounds but now it is fixed i am using cs3 extended suite daily with photoshop being 90 of my use there may be some issues with other components that im not aware of but ps is problem free for me i wouldnt hesitate to upgrade cs3 has substantial new abilities the adobe forums are product specific and can quickly point you to any on going issues but as always remember a few folks will have problems there is only serious concern when you see wide spread commentary on a single issue to michael hurley adobe cs3 will run on mac os 10 4 8 or later so you could install it on your existing mdd g4s with no problem personally id wait to buy new machines until apple issues a few more 10 5 updates that fix most of the problems people are having right now thought you might be interested in my open letter to steve jobs macintouch reader apple quietly discontinued its wonderful xraid yesterday and is now reselling a different and much more expensive product called promise vtrak e class these arent configurable through apple i called and confirmed yesterday and the entry price is now more than 4000 than the previous configurable options for the xraid for a medium sized marketing agency like mine this is painful we now have to hope that apple changes its mind and offers smbs something smaller cheaper and more configurable than a 6tb raid for 12 000 yes thats the cheapest option if one of our resellers doesnt have a leftover in stock next month when we were prepared to buy where am i going to get that extra 4 000 in my already tight and dwindling it budget just when you thought apple was making inroads in the enterprise they pull something like this jay morgan xserves disappearing suddenly is one of the reasons apple does not do well in the enterprise corporate world companies need some advance notice when this type of thing is discontinued im a sun employee and when we have a product that goes eol we announce eol on one day actual last order date is 90 days later and last ship date is 90 days after that large customers are provided with more advanced notice as many companies depend upon product roadmaps for their planning years in advance the mac mini may not fit the needs of a video professional such as anthony burokas but it fits my needs just fine i have one of the original intel core duo mac minis and use it as my htpc i chose the mac mini over the tv at the time because the tv really needed a mac or pc to act as a media server when it was first introduced our household has nothing but laptops and we were looking for a media server to hold all of our content more importantly we find ourselves watching a lot of streaming on line video and therefore need a web browser to access the streaming video our mac mini is connected to our television using the the dvi to s video adapter we use it for everything from watching downloaded video content in itunes front row dvd player to listening to music in itunes front row to watching streaming web media to making video content ipod and iphone ready our media is stored on three 500 gb external firewire drives we do not use it for editing video in final cut express or preparing content for delivery using compressor for us the mac mini is perfect to each their own regarding is comments about apple and innovation and hardware i am confused is he referring to the internal hardware or the form factor of the cases for example though the external case of the mac mini has not changed significantly since its introduction in 2005 the mac mini has undergone several internal upgrades including one stealth ppc upgrade and the switch to the intel architecture as well as an update to the core 2 duo chip 02 2006 09 2006 08 2007 regarding the imac technically the external case design was introduced with the imac g5 isight 10 2005 which was introduced in late 2005 more importantly since that time the imac has undergone several internal updates 01 2006 09 2006 08 2007 as far as the macbook pro is concerned um well the first powerbook g4 was not introduced in 2000 but rather 2001 more importantly the form factor of the powerbook g4 titanium family and the successor powerbook g4 aluminum family only have their name and a case made from metal as opposed to plastic composite in common the powerbook g4 aluminum family and the macbook pro family do share a similar form factor which was introduced in january 2003 with the 12in and 17in powerbook g4 as with the mac mini and imac apples pro portable machines have gone through numerous internal updates 123macmini reports an amusing yet very functional custom mac mini more photos on the creators site

2516608 how long will it take someone at apple to realize that a product garnering less than a two stars with over 500 reviews indicates a major problem
2516609 regarding your second point which we see raised frequently isnt it the case that reviews apple or amazon for example are at least as often positive as negative
2516610 regarding your second point which we see raised frequently isnt it the case that reviews apple or amazon for example are at least as often positive as negative take a look at the 30 inch cinema display which has 4 5 5 stars for its rating macintouch
2516611 the vast majority of programs only support two processors cores and when this is the case the computer is simply overworked by the application the third core is ideal for handling additional background tasks it reduces the load on the other two cores and allows the dual core application to continue operating without disruption

2516658 the story is false its completely untrue ridiculous ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2516659 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
2516660 like an old courgar fool shes an idiot a moron a faux guru but not mean spirited
2516661 ostensibly jaded cocaine addled sexually voracious 20 year old who was shall we may inspired by rielle
2516662 thousands of friends and supporters of senator edwards put their faith and confidence in him and he has let them down young supporters who put their time and energy into his campaign with a newfound energy and idealism for politics have been betrayed by his actions but the issues we cared about and fought for poverty worker justice clean environment and health care for all are issues worth continuing to fight
2516663 he sangakkara held the innings together we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did the concentration he showed is what makes him a world class batsman
2516664 we will be looking to try and get as far ahead as possible and then bowl them out again a lot of hard work has to be done by both the teams
2516665 parthiv has got a minor cut and he will be ok
2516666 but getting that first race under your belt feels really good
2516667 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries
2516668 i am very happy to win the game against a technically good japan side
2516669 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2516670 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
2516671 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2516672 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2516673 russian military forces have gone through all the red lines by crossing an internationally recognised border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2516674 this is a clear act with visible elements of aggression and an outrageous violation of international law with grave consequences to regional and euro atlantic stability and security as well as to euro atlantic relations with russia
2516675 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2516676 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences
2516677 russische luftstreitkr fte bombardieren auf dem gesamten territorium georgiens zivile und milit rische ziele
2516678 die russische f deration versucht ihre offene kriegerische aggression gegen ihren souver nen nachbarstaat als sogenannte humanit re hilfe zu verschleiern
2516679 88 to know that it means what year it is plus canada needs to get a pantone swatch book and give some other color a try the red is getting really tired and boring already were held that year in

2516694 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2516695 the way i approached the game changed that day i just had one thing in my mind that i have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad
2516696 my first reaction was of absolute joy i could hardly believe it
2516697 a plus point was the chief selector was there i hadnt done as well as id wanted to in the indian premier league so i knew this tournament was an important opportunity it was pressure to have the chairman watching me against tough opposition but once i started doing well i grew more confident about my batting
2516698 dilip sir asked me to keep doing what i do i knew he had been observing me for sometime now and i hope i can live up to his expectations
2516699 he is a very physical type of player he likes to impose himself on the game backs it up with his skill
2516700 i cant be bogged down by a bowler i just like to give it back
2516701 i was asked to open the innings which i dont usually but i remained unbeaten on 120 and helped india win
2516702 he was disappointed that on a couple of occasions he didnt get as many runs as he should have simply because he had wanted to get a reasonable amount of runs a little bit too early therefore we agreed he should be looking to bat into the 40th over
2516703 he just told me to recognise my strong areas during the game and go for the shots i felt confident of and could pull off
2516704 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2516705 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2516706 among a huge swath of chinese the games have taken on a meaning both more benign and more complex amid todays prosperity opinion polls and individual conversations show a groundswell of unbridled optimism in many ways the chinese have embraced the american dream the belief that tomorrow will be better than today
2516707 look we are definitely not running the full mileage today lets aim for 80 and call it a day
2516708 oh nice job why on earth did we run all the way to the turn around i thought we were cutting this short today now i have to get all the way back to my car again
2516709 hey ill give you the 40 bucks in my car if you run back in and let me have your bike
2516710 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2516711 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2516712 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was
2516713 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2516714 i was mesmerised i could have stayed in the stadium all night
2516715 i had the time of my life and i had said before that people would have great difficulty to find the words and that was a pretty accurate assessment
2516716 it was remarkable i think we saw a new horizon
2516717 it is a stadium that has been tested and our team is great and dreaming has already started
2516718 wir reden dar ber aber es ist die entscheidung des pr sidenten
2516719 der einzige ausweg aus der tragischen krise die durch die georgische f hrung provoziert wurde der abzug der bewaffneten verb nde durch tiflis aus der konfliktzone ist

2516750 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2516751 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2516752 that was probably the hardest bout ive ever fenced in my career
2516753 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2516754 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2516755 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2516756 of course my heart skipped a beat hearing the news i get concerned but at the same time you just have to be smart and live your life
2516757 parece ser que en gente con un cierto perfil gen tico la reacci n f sica inicial al cigarrillo puede jugar un papel determinante en lo que pasa luego
2516758 si se sigue fumando la adicci n a la nicotina sucede en pocos d as o meses
2516759 if a gun dealer loses its federal firearms license we should be more vigilant about the connection to criminal activity not turn a blind eye and open a floodgate of guns on our streets
2516760 we should not give a pass those who would arm violent gang members and threaten the safety of our communities in the northern suburbs of illinois there are now more than 2 000 documented drug gang members through atf trace data
2516761 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries
2516762 that was something i really wanted to do after watching the first three heats
2516763 i kind of wanted to go first or second seed
2516764 but it was a pretty smooth swim for me so ill take it
2516765 of course id like to win every event that i swim
2516766 hes so dominant i think most swimmers are just trying to get second because they dont feel like they can beat him
2516767 shes so much like me she always wants me to put my lipstick on her she pouts her lips so i can put a little bit on
2516768 if im in the bath she wants to get in the bath if i put a face mask on she wants a face mask on i put a little bit on her nose and a dot on each cheek so when she looks in the mirror it looks to her like shes the same as me
2516769 anything girlie and sparkly like my jewellery she digs through it
2516770 some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently cased by desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2516771 but we have stood with one another through them all
2516772 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2516773 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2516774 what sports will you be most interested in watching during the olympics and why list as many as you like
2516775 good idea but shes an incorporeal dragon and the paint wont stick
2516776 a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
2516777 theres not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb
2516778 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
2516779 hes a highly devoted young man and very dedicated to human rights issues
2516780 he took a great risk by coming here today but it was very dear to him to come here and highlight the human rights abuses being committed against the tibetan people
2516781 yes theres things that other governments would do different in terms of how they would deal with dissidents and protests but one hopes the olympics will give china the incentive to evolve their own approach in a way that will be very positive in the future
2516782 we want to send a clear message that the truth has to be exposed the reality behind the hosting of the olympic games and the stories that are not being told
2516783 its important to us to showcase the fact there is no freedom in tibet and they are dying as a result of the chinese occupation
2516784 im always disappointed when the olympics are used as a venue for making these political statements on other issues and for the canadian flag to be used in that way of course im disappointed
2516785 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2516786 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2516787 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2516788 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2516789 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2516790 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2516791 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2516792 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2516793 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2516794 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2516795 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2516796 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2516797 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2516798 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2516799 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2516800 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2516801 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2516802 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2516803 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2516804 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2516805 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2516806 it brings reality to the myth of drinking and driving
2516807 when they get out here and see what it looks like to be drunk that has a real impact on a students life
2516808 im looking for this to shock them so when they have to make that tough decision i want them to make the right decision
2516809 every time an officer pulls over a car they take a risk
2516810 think about that just a second if they do a traffic stop and theyre out on the street by themselves they never know what that car has got in it you never know what an officers going to run into
2516811 i have students who have graduated and gone onto college who come back and talk to me about how that dwi traffic stop i went to changed my life
2516812 education starts at home when we start talking about drinking and driving it has gone to be supported in the house
2516813 so when i bring parents out here and they stand right beside their son and watch the checkpoint go on and see how it impacts peoples lives i think thats a tremendous impact in a childs life and in a parents life
2516814 my nephew is exposed to a lot of this with a lot of college students and i think its a great lesson he can take back and share with his buddies of what hes going to experience tonight
2516815 drinking and driving affects everybody weve lost quite a few students here in wake county in the last three or four years
2516816 at the end of the day we want them our children to make good decisions the one thats not going to impact them for the rest of their lives but most importantly not hurt someone else for the rest of their lives
2516817 me habituei a dizer que quando entro aqui aperto o bot o do exploda se
2516818 dont let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it the time will pass anyway we might just as well put that passing time to the best possible use
2516819 i felt good before it started but maybe i just took it out too fast
2516820 ill have to adjust a little bit but the important thing is that i qualified for the next round even if it was 16th
2516821 i dont want to be the center of attention just yet its like youre playing a game of cards right now and those guys are showing their hands there are a lot of peacocks out there showing their feathers
2516822 we won some games that we played well in and we won some games where we didnt do so well
2516823 we understand we could have played better we know that once we move the ball on offense and all play together then were an unbelievable team when we dont we become just as good as anyone else thats the most important thing we figured out
2516824 teams are not in awe of us as much as they were with the dream team
2516825 theyve seen us they know us they want to play us they feel they can beat us and thats ok we have to get it done
2516826 thats the point were trying to get across if we can run offense like were playing against ourselves thats much better
2516827 all these guys would rather play in big games theyre ready to play olympic basketball games for the u s
2516828 these games are so hyped and theres so much pressure around it that it will fine tune our focus

2516835 so you think public speaking only occurs on a stage think again read this article to find out how you are already using your public speaking skills
2516836 i told you so if you ate too many apples youd get a tummy ache
2516837 get up now you are not spending your entire summer vacation sleeping til noon
2516838 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2516839 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2516840 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2516841 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2516842 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2516843 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2516844 at this point we have no one to call on
2516845 because there are no takers we are left with just one option closure
2516846 after five years surely something needs to change if youngsters at those schools continue to receive an inferior education they deserve better
2516847 everybody wants a fighting chance to succeed but the perception about many of these schools is you wont get a fighting chance
2516848 im pleased they decided not to wait for the state before they took action
2516849 dallas is the only school district to get an early jump like this but hopefully this will be a model for other schools in a similar situation
2516850 theres a reason u s schools get their butts kicked in international comparisons
2516851 youve got to remove the obstacles that limit instructional time
2516852 you can put them in a new building you can hire all new teachers but if you dont have a principal who can effect change nothings going to happen you have to have a principal who can lead the change
2516853 weve had to increase security at the powerstation and members of staff have been worried by what might happen to them
2516854 the power station is generating its business as usual so much to the extent it can be on this extraordinary day
2516855 we just want to try and send a message to people that we dont want anymore new coal its something thats not going to help our future at all
2516856 people had a habit of looking at me as if i were some kind of mirror instead of a person they didnt see me they saw their own lewd thoughts then they white masked themselves by calling me the lewd one
2516857 i knew i belonged to the public and to the world not because i was talented or even beautiful but because i had never belonged to anything or anyone else
2516858 everybody is always tugging at you theyd all like a sort of chunk out of you i don think they realize it but its like grrr do this grr do that but you do want to stay intact intact and on two feet
2516859 i would never hurt my babies theyre my babies we were only traveling about 10 miles per hour
2516860 i basically wanted to swim easy swum the race i wanted to swim
2516861 got the rhythm i wanted to get not as quick as i wanted it to be
2516862 i dont want to be the center of attention just yet i dont want to be breaking world records the first night were here its like were playing a card game right now and those guys are showing their hand a lot of peacocks out there showing their feathers im just chilling in the back thats exactly where i want to be
2516863 i knew i had to go fast given what taehwan park and the other guys did in the heat before me
2516864 i didnt want to take any chances with the last heat going all best times you know leaving me in the dust so i put a lot into it really didnt have much of a choice
2516865 i would have preferred to go a little easier but that being said ive still got some gas in the tank for tomorrow
2516866 my heart was beating a little bit in the ready room but i felt like i breathed through it now that i have four years under my belt i know how to deal with it better
2516867 while our elementary school students are doing very well we recognize there are problems in our high schools that we want to address
2516868 we had some resistance from members who thought it was another giveaway to illegal immigrants
2516869 the truth is this is a great opportunity for kids to learn another language at an age appropriate time i hope this court order gives us some impetus to try out new approaches like this
2516870 we are disappointed that the judge reversed his original order of a year ago
2516871 we are continuing to study this latest ruling but we do anticipate asking the attorney general to appeal
2516872 we know that these programs have been effective for thousands of students
2516873 i dont feel very comfortable about our esl programs statewide absolutely not
2516874 thats not as good a program as the bilingual program it leads me to believe theres a lot of work to be done to deliver a different program i have no idea what thats going to look like
2516875 the decision reinforces the need and urgency for us to do something as a state
2516876 we need to develop new programs and new approaches in meeting the needs of these children my hope is that the state will see this as an opportunity to improve the quality of the programs and not see it as a threat
2516877 i dont know how on earth the state can say the esl program is successful in any manner
2516878 theyre not being told to develop a whole new program it just needs to be a program with some teeth in it
2516879 will require a commitment not only from the state but also from school districts and principals many of our schools have been neglecting the needs of these students by holding low expectations for them and providing poor resources for their education
2516880 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2516881 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families

2516886 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish
2516887 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents

2517013 while there are some older s60 models that are cheaper than this a launch price is just a starting point and the actual price inevitably drops over time a year from now it could well be that the 5320 costs 150 euros plus taxes or perhaps even less this is taking the s60 platform tantalisingly close to the average sale price of mobile phones which is the hardware cost of the average phone that people buy and which currently stands at around 80 to 90 euros if the s60 platforms phones reach this price or even go below it it may allow them to leave the expensive niche that smartphones have traditionally found themselves stuck in and instead become genuinely mass market devices used by a large chunk of the planet

2517050 the worst thing was it was shown on tv in front of the whole of australia
2517051 nick is a wonderful guy i just feel embarrassed for him because hes the one who said it
2517052 i feel sorry for him in a sense but at the same time i dont i actually think i deserve an apology
2517053 we have become really good friends on monday we spoke twice and he didnt give an inkling he was going to say something bad on tv
2517054 he just asked me if i was going to watch it
2517055 i think we can still definitely be friends but i wont be talking to him until i get an apology and find out the real reason behind why he said that

2517064 something really bizarre is happening in the skies over the uk
2517065 ive been dealing in sightings for 30 years and we currently have something very real which mankind cannot explain
2517066 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
2517067 would not give assent to such a process of rendition
2517068 the united states sought australias views on the possibility of mr habibs transfer to egypt and that mr richardson conveyed the view that the australian government could not support any transfer of mr habib to egypt
2517069 my assumption is that it was because of longstanding australian government policy going back over decades that australia does not support torture and so we would not support a position where one of our citizens was put in the position of being rendered
2517070 it is such a serious matter that it warrants the air being cleared
2517071 were certainly not in favour of torture and i dont think any government in australia would condone the use of torture
2517072 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2517073 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics

2517076 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families

2517078 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2517079 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2517080 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2517081 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families

2517114 a lot of these families would rather go home but because of the situation in burma they cant
2517115 i think those things are very encouraging and i think they also say something about the people of burma that the people of burma will be able to run the country once they have a chance
2517116 america reiterates our call on burmas military junta to release aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners
2517117 well continue working until the people of burma have their freedom that they deserve
2517118 the junta uses those resources to prop themselves up for their own benefit not for the benefit of the people of burma
2517119 we think that the way we can be most effective is financially is for the countries that are propping the regime up by their large trade with them to discontinue that for some amount of time at least to really put the squeeze on the junta so that they would finally start the dialogue that everyone has been calling for

2517124 the number of federal appeals court judgeships has not changed since 1990
2517125 we could not handle our caseload without the assistance of staff attorneys
2517126 minimize the time spent on the large number of pro se and counseled cases that do not present factual or legal issues that require oral argument for appropriate resolution
2517127 this enables us to allocate additional time to those more complex cases that are set for oral argument
2517128 we save the judges a lot of time by carefully going through volumes of handwritten and often imprecise legal arguments and putting these in a form along with citations to the record briefs and applicable case law that saves the judges time
2517129 if for example a precedent is cited and the other side then offers a distinction and the judges on the panel cannot think of a good answer to the distinction but nevertheless for some extraneous reason wish to reject it they can easily do so through the device of an abbreviated unpublished opinion and no one will ever be the wiser i dont say that judges are actually doing this only that the temptation exists or if after hearing argument a judge in conference thinks that a certain decision should be reached but also believes that the decision is hard to justify under the law he or she can achieve the result assuming agreement by the other members of the panel by deciding the case in an unpublished opinion and sweeping the difficulties under the rug again im not saying that this has ever occurred in any particular case but a system that encourages this sort of behavior or is at least open to it has to be subject to question in any world in which judgesare human beings
2517130 orders regulating communications between litigants pose a grave threat to first amendment freedom of speech accordingly a district courts discretion to issue such orders must be exercised within the bounds of the first amendment and the federal rules
2517131 t he principal purpose of the first amendments guaranty is to prevent prior restraints
2517132 there are checks on the judiciary and channels to correct improper decisions the appeal process affords litigants the opportunity to challenge a judicial ruling
2517133 injunction prohibiting plaintiff from contacting any of the defendants and or their supervisory employees
2517134 notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary a judge may designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court except a motion for injunctive relief
2517135 an injunction is a coercive order by a court directing a party to do or refrain from doing something and applies to future actions
2517136 an injunction may be defined as an order that is directed to a party enforceable by contempt and designed to accord or protect some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint in more than temporary
2517137 a prohibitory sometimes called preventive injunction is one that operates to restrain the commission or continuance of an act and to prevent a threatened injury
2517138 a judicial order that prevents a statute regulation or administrative decision from taking effect is an injunction and must be justified under the standards commonly used to evaluate judicial interference with the decisions of the political branches of government
2517139 in this action plaintiff alleges that the issuance of the june and july 2000
2517140 contacting communicating or in any way interfering with the attorney client relationship
2517141 moreover the magistrate judge and district court attempted to clarify with mason that the orders were not injunctions but rather necessary for the orderly litigation of the case
2517142 heartland renewed their motion based on masons continued contact with them
2517143 on 25 july 2000 the magistrate judge granted heartlands motion
2517144 plaintiff shall be prohibited from contacting any of the defendants including their supervisory employees and or the individual defendants regarding any matter related to this case
2517145 temporary restraining orders and permanent injunctions i e court orders that actually forbid speech activities are classic examples of prior restraints
2517146 pure speech speech not connected with any conduct the presumption of unconstitutionality is virtually insurmountable
2517147 communicating directly with tes employees staff or tess counsel counsels employees or counsels staff
2517148 case law is not always necessary to clearly establish a right a right may be so clear from the text of the constitution or federal statute that no prior decision is necessary to give clear notice of it to an official
2517149 t he general presumption against prior restraints is not mitigated by a claim that the fair and orderly administration of justice is at stake
2517150 material unequivocally not protected by the constitution may be the subject of a prior restraint if sufficient procedural safeguards are provided this possibility does not exist in the present case because the communications proscribed by the order are constitutionally protected
2517151 information on representing yourself in a civil action non prisoner united district court south carolina
2517152 discovery refers to the process of obtaining facts and information about the case from the other party in order to prepare for trial

2517155 a judgment or order is entered for purposes of rule 4 a when it is entered in compliance with rule 58 and 79 a of the federal rules of civil procedure
2517156 the time to file a notice of appeal does not begin to run until a separate judgment is entered pursuant to rule 58 there is no lack of appellate jurisdiction on the basis of untimeliness
2517157 c ases from both the supreme court and the circuit courts of appeal make it clear that the time to file a notice of appeal does not begin to run until a separate judgment is entered pursuant to rule 58 411 u s 216 93 s ct 1562 1973
2517158 eleventh circuit notice of appeal does not divest district judge of jurisdiction of matters involved in the appeal

2517160 must comply with the mandates of due process both in determining that the requisite bad faith exists and in assessing fees
2517161 courts as well as citizens are not free to ignore all the procedures of the law the constitutional freedom of which the court speaks can be won only if judges honor the constitution
2517162 due process is perhaps the most majestic concept in our whole constitutional system
2517163 the right to petition extends to all departments of the government
2517164 t he right of access to the courts is but one aspect of the right of petition
2517165 the right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition
2517166 the constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that prisoners be afforded access to the courts in order to hallenge unlawful convictions and to seek redress for violations of their constitutional rights

2517174 canon 3a 5 is violated where there is a pattern of unreasonable delay or where a particular instance is so lacking in legitimate justification that it is willful
2517175 the courts no less than the political branches of the government must respect the limits of their authority
2517176 appellants motion for clarification is granted and this courts april 15 2002 order clarified as follows appellants motions which were construed as motions for summary reversal were denied because appellant failed to meet the standards for summary disposition see
2517177 it is not proper for federal courts to proceed immediately to a merits question despite jurisdictional objections in re madison guaranty savings amp loan association 173 f
2517178 on every writ of error or appeal the first and fundamental question is that of jurisdiction first of this court and then of the court from which the record comes
2517179 we have noted that a party may raise jurisdiction at any time during the pendency of the proceedings
2517180 c onsequently defects in subject matter jurisdiction require correction regardless of whether the error was raised in district court
2517181 the objection that a federal court lacks subject matter jurisdiction
2517182 although the parties have not raised the issue here we are obliged to consider sua sponte the question of our subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case before us
2517183 obligated to inquire into subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking
2517184 as a threshold matter therefore we must initially determine both whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider williams rule 60 b motion and whether this court has jurisdiction to review the district courts denial of his motion
2517185 an appellate court has a duty to consider sua sponte whether appellate jurisdiction is properly invoked
2517186 when a colorable question exists an appellate court has an unflagging obligation to inquire sua sponte into its own jurisdiction
2517187 federal courts sometimes will ignore the legal label that a pro se litigant attaches to a motion and recharacterize the motion in order to place it within a different legal category
2517188 pro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will therefore be liberally construed
2517189 noting that a pro se motion should be liberally construed to afford review on any
2517190 the first comprises those cases where time is truly of the essence this includes situations where important public policy issues are involved or those where rights delayed are rights denied
2517191 the loss of constitutional rights for even a minimal amount of time constitutes irreparable harm
2517192 first amendment rights violated sufficient to show irreparable injury because loss of first amendment freedoms for even minimal periods of time unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury
2517193 plaintiff shall be prohibited from contacting any of the defendants including their supervisory employees and or the individual defendants regarding any matter related to this case

2517200 judge graham is expressly rejecting the authority of the united states supreme court who has said on multiple occasions that the right of access to the courts is constitutionally protected and requires due process before that right is abridged or restrained in any manner
2517201 if for example a precedent is cited and the other side then offers a distinction and the judges on the panel cannot think of a good answer to the distinction but nevertheless for some extraneous reason wish to reject it they can easily do so through the device of an abbreviated unpublished opinion and no one will ever be the wiser i dont say that judges are actually doing this only that the temptation exists or if after hearing argument a judge in conference thinks that a certain decision should be reached but also believes that the decision is hard to justify under the law he or she can achieve the result assuming agreement by the other members of the panel by deciding the case in an unpublished opinion and sweeping the difficulties under the rug again im not saying that this has ever occurred in any particular case but a system that encourages this sort of behavior or is at least open to it has to be subject to question in any world in which judges are human beings
2517202 it is the general rule of this circuit that the filing of a timely and sufficient notice of appeal acts to divest the trial court of jurisdiction over the matters at issue in the appeal except to the extent that the trial court must act in aid of the appeal
2517203 the general rule regarding divestiture of jurisdiction however does not apply to collateral matters not affecting the questions presented on appeal
2517204 highlands county filed two motions for sanctions in the form of dismissal of the plaintiffs lawsuit
2517205 they claimed that during the week of 5 february 2001 mason had demanded to view his personnel file from highlands countys human resource director fred carino a named defendant in the case
2517206 repeatedly personally contacted by e mail supervisory employees and or individual defendants
2517207 has clearly stated that because dismissal is considered a drastic sanction a district court may only implement it as a last resort when 1 a party engages in a clear pattern of delay or willful contempt contumacious conduct and 2 the district court specifically finds that lesser sanctions would not suffice
2517208 a district court has authority under federal rules of civil procedure 41 b to dismiss actions for failure to comply with local rules
2517209 although we occasionally have found implicit in an order the conclusion that
2517210 the right to petition extends to all departments of the government

2517212 the right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition
2517213 the constitutional guarantee of due process of law has as a corollary the requirement that prisoners be afforded access to the courts in order to challenge unlawful convictions and to seek redress for violations of their constitutional rights
2517214 a judgment rendered in violation of due process is void in the rendering state and is not entitled to full faith and credit elsewhere
2517215 t he constitution by prohibiting an act renders it void if done otherwise the prohibition were nugatory thus the warrant is a nullity
2517216 no judgment of a court is due process of law if rendered without jurisdiction in the court or without notice to the party
2517217 notice and a hearing are required if the district court
2517218 may not be expanded beyond the meaning of its terms absent notice and an opportunity to be heard
2517219 in the case of the southern district of florida the only courts it must be obedient to are the eleventh circuit and the supreme court of the united states
2517220 notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary a judge may designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court except a motion for injunctive relief
2517221 courts cannot judicially create any exceptions or exclusions to floridas public records act
2517222 we find no authority to support the argument that florida power amp light by engaging in litigation before a federal forum has somehow given up its independent statutory rights to review public records under chapter 119
2517223 there is no doubt that we are bound by a state courts construction of a state statute
2517224 a federal court applying state law is bound to adhere to decisions of the states intermediate appellate courts absent some persuasive indication that the states highest court would decide the issue otherwise
2517225 we have recently stated that the right of access to public records is a substantive right
2517226 prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts
2517227 serious legal error is more likely to amount to misconduct than a minor mistake
2517228 t he florida supreme court has expressly held that a judges legal rulings can be the subject of judicial disciplinary proceedings
2517229 a single instance of serious egregious legal error particularly one involving the denial to individuals of their basic or fundamental rights may amount to in re quirk 705 so
2517230 j udicial misconduct including improper ex parte communications varies in degree from plainly criminal or corrupt misconduct through injudicious but not corrupt misconduct to misconduct committed for proper motives though pursued by prohibited means
2517231 legal error by a judge may constitute grounds for a finding of judicial misconduct if the commission of legal error is founded on bad faith
2517232 an experienced trial judges ignorance of proper contempt procedures without more has been held to constitute the bad faith necessary to a finding of willful misconduct
2517233 government remains the servant of the people even when citizens are litigating against it
2517234 there is nothing in the disciplinary rules which restrict a clients right to act independently in initiating communications with the other side or which requires that lawyers prevent or attempt to discourage such conduct
2517235 contact between litigants however is specifically authorized by the comments under rule 4 2 also parties to a matter may communicate directly with each other and a lawyer having independent justification for communicating with the other party is permitted to do so
2517236 no general rule prevents a lawyers client either personally or through a nonlawyer agent from communicating directly with a represented nonclient
2517237 p arties to a matter may communicate directly with each other and a lawyer having independent justification for communicating with the other party is permitted to do so
2517238 eleventh circuit sits idly by while a clearly void sua sponte issued pre filing injunction wreaks havoc on a mans life

2517242 furthermore mason appealed the dismissal of his case as well as the district courts injunction order of this statement is directly contradicted by the eleventh circuits prior assertion of moreover mason had an adequate remedy to mandamus relief in that he could have timely appealed the september 20 2001 but did not do so

2517266 but theres no where else to look i even phone professor desmond squealch for advice i thought maybe he could invent a machine for finding joan but even he couldnt help
2517267 by golly but i reckon theres one place you aint been lookin
2517268 you aint been seen them head shrinkin fellas in town it was them what made all this troublin stuff get them to undo the stuff they do make them find your sister
2517269 mum youre a genius but not in the way you think they can find her they can find her by training me to use my brain like she used hers just because were unrelated and come from completely different species i see no reason why joan and i shouldnt have the same mental powers its just a matter of opening the door inside my mind
2517270 theyve been testing joan for extra sensory perception and other paranormal powers well mum and i have long believed that shes been a mental balloon just waiting to burst it was just a matter of time ive seen it coming and tried to delay the inevitable for as long as i could by keeping her stress levels down and getting her the custard pot leveling job with you but now i think theyve over stimulated her brain and now shes finally done it
2517271 shes popped but where are all the guts gore and high velocity blood spatter the place was as clean a whistle she hadnt even taken a clandestine tinkle in the corner
2517272 so you see that its quite possible that joan either teleported through a temporal vortex or fell through a tear in the space time continuum
2517273 so which do you prefer the first one or the second
2517274 and more importantly what do you suggest i do about it
2517275 they think that its 73 haunted by the ghost of my pet woodlouse norman
2517276 it doesnt drag chains about and shriek like the earwigs of hamster hell you know
2517277 it sits at the foot of the bed and gently nibbles at an ethereal log
2517278 but that matters not my dead pet woodlouse is of no consequence this is a roof over our head while we consider our futures this can be our temporary haven of solitude and anyone who thinks otherwise or can put up a reasonable counter argument can go fluff themselves
2517279 just as long as no one down there spots up poncing about up here in broad daylight first
2517280 i did save you from drowning the least you should do is help me make good my escape its not like im stix or anything anti governmental im a fugitive from justice and its not my fault and im missing the adventures of captain shakedick on television the last episode was a cliff hanger too
2517281 the poor girls got a family waiting for her i know im only a cavy but if you put it to the vote im up for saving the sweet things skin
2517282 but i happen to agree its dark all the idiot inhabitants of weasels pit will have taken to their beds by now lets get down to the lake and find that sewer outlet
2517283 i mean might the pike not take you or the
2517284 ill just walk around the edge of the lake then climb down to the outlet getting inside might be problematic but im a hamster im sure ill think of something
2517285 byee everyone ill think of you with every tub of custard that i level
2517286 i like stout girls i wouldnt have minded having rampant non reproductive sexual intercourse with her what do you say brother alfonso

2517330 but abbot its raining outside ill catch my death of cold
2517331 youll catch your death of something else if you dont get out there this instant
2517332 you ride to weasels pit where you will inform the law master that the fugitives she seeks are within the abbey walls and will remain so until the morning now go quickly to the critter shed and select yourself a mount
2517333 your owner he is in great peril give me a sign that you can hear me
2517334 what brings you out here on such a crap awful night sugar
2517335 in the light of what brother dos fresas has told us anywhere is preferable to here come
2517336 have you forgotten some desperately important artifact perhaps i can hide it for you until another day when freedom once more walks the land of prannick and you can return to take back that which is rightly yours
2517337 i get these funny feelings 55 every once in a while i sense danger
2517338 we are far from weasels pit and you are a mere serf how could you possibly sense danger enough of this silliness lets be about our way with the utmost alacrity
2517339 well obviously not as good as your talent of walking between worlds but yes its helped me out of bother once or twice
2517340 theres about twenty of them theyre coming this way lawmen i think armed to the incisors and ready to slit our throats
2517341 i know some really brainy hamsters in the head shrinkers department at the institute of hugely important studies whod kill to meet you
2517342 for are you not headed on the road to knackered dobbin as we speak did you suspect that i might have been staying with my cousin tobias frooty and so sought to catch me standing in the pantry with my knickers round my ankles
2517343 i can see in your eyes that you speak the truth do you have message from the abbot for me
2517344 i inverted it and quickly wrote in case of emergency piss here in felt tip pen naturally i tore out the lining and hung it upon a nearby trestle i didnt think youd want it spoiled
2517345 of course theyre all far too uncivilized to dab their willies dry upon it im certain that it will remain unsoiled and fit to once more protect the royal head fur from any amount of vicious chafing
2517346 and when you wash out my helmet i insist that you use only the most daintily fragranced soap from spanx i have some in my carpet bag
2517347 tis i brother algy tumbler pray let us in i have the law master of weasels pit with me she wishes to speak with the abbot
2517348 no es possible bandits are in the forest you look like bandits to me you must leave instantaneously
2517349 i have seen better examples at the thrudsday farmers market in winkers bottom now go away
2517350 let the law master in and take her to our guests immediately
2517351 gone gone where find them find them now find them or you take their places
2517352 im going to regain my composure by praying to the wheel make sure that the law master leaves in a contented mood i dont want to be disturbed
2517353 r pidamente you must escape now i have sent the law master down to the lower latrines there was a hideous blowback this afternoon when she has managed to haul herself from the filth and disgustingness happiness will elude her we go now
2517354 how can we escape by gaining the upper floor are we expected to leap from the roof onto nearby rhubarb fronds from whence we can slide to safety if so i should warn you that my depth perception is a little wanting ill probably miss and fall to an agonizing death
2517355 youre going down the rear fire escape from there you can disappear into the forest
2517356 we cant go barging in hell call the law master and even if he doesnt hes bound to notice brother alfonso his career as a monk could lay in ruins
2517357 it was this party trick that got me noticed by the head shrinkers department of the institute for hugely important studies
2517358 i can see into rooms without the aid of a window key hole handy cardboard periscope or any artificial means all i have to do is imagine a light source within the room then if theres anyone inside i can see their bodies interrupt the imaginary beam of light if the beam remains uninterrupted then hooray the room is empty
2517359 assuming that accuracy is taken 63 for granted does it have a useful application in the real world
2517360 now were well and truly fluffed we cant go forward and we cant go back
2517361 no intiendo from where did the other body come the monks are all nicely tucked up in bed there can be no one else
2517362 the abbot said that he was going to pray do the figures kneel can you see that precisely
2517363 well i reckon one of them is kneeling i guess thatd mean someone is praying one seems to be standing over the other maybe administering some quaint religious sacrament i cant be certain im not a certain kind of person
2517364 mother superior did you lose your way in the dark on the way to the nunnery and were your clothes torn from your body by so many wild brambles that they were left in tatters and had to be abandoned in the forest
2517365 but i can draw blood with greater skill than the butchest hamster in all prannick and probably other places too
2517366 you must save him of course have you tried the critter shed
2517367 do clearly i cannot remain here i am implicated with a group
2517368 i had no idea that monks had such vivid imaginations
2517369 who says i had to imagine anything you really do not know me at all
2517370 it is too late for monika to come to beijing now and take part in the olympic games because we have closed the entry process
2517371 what can mr kalmadi do it is not national games it is olympic games and only ioc can take a decision
2517372 monika just cannot take part in the beijing olympics as of now the organisers have not accepted her entry and to be honest i dont see her competing here
2517373 see you cannot stop anyone from coming here but the thing is she cannot take part her name has been withdrawn and how can she compete she will not be allowed to enter the olympic village
2517374 if this keeps on im going to blow my brains out please give me whatever advice you can
2517375 since trajectory isnt important here our recommendation would be a 35 remington with 200 grain soft nose bullet
2517376 it was really a tough day of test cricket and i think tomorrow will be the same
2517377 we will trying to get as many runs as possible as we can but i can tell you that there is a lot of hard work still to be done in this match
2517378 we needed someone who could do that to anchor the innings and that is what he did the concentration he showed in batting for long periods at times is what makes him world class
2517379 there is a little turn in the pitch also it is not difficult to play yourself to get in and if you are confident and positive it is not impossible to score runs either
2517380 take any lead we can get and bowl as well as we have in the previous five innings
2517381 in the galle test they took the last five wickets for less than ten runs if that happens you know it can become a fairly even test
2517382 of course we will be trying to stop them from doing that but any lead we get will be gladly accepted

2517389 it is a fact that this country has made significant gains over the past four years and as a government and a people we cannot allow lawlessness and crime to erode the tangible benefits and the quality of life that our country now enjoys
2517390 the truth is unpalatable to some people but the recent killing of dr mullany and the brutal attack on her husband are threats to our very survival as they directly threaten our main industry tourism
2517391 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time
2517392 all of my family knows about this and just to be absolutely clear none of them are responsible for it i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2517393 china is the regional power they do not want the west to come over to control burma
2517394 take the diplomatic approach to the chinese government quietly criticising
2517395 china has real political power in burma but has simply been unable or unwilling over the past 20 years to make a real difference
2517396 it is interesting because it is in chinas interests to promote a stable burma and frankly it is not
2517397 if china drops its support for the burmese regime it will collapse
2517398 thats why we are asking them the international community to meet them and give another chance to talk

2517429 fans always cheer when the offense catches the ball they get a first down and they cheer they only cheer for the defense if we get some crazy sack or an interception for us to have a rule go our way one thats good for us for a change i feel like celebrating like we just won a championship game
2517430 we feel like if we catch the ball inbounds it should be a catch it will change things defensive backs are just going to shove you out of bounds now it could definitely impact some plays
2517431 it helps them kind of like an extra defender as a receiver you have to make sure you get yourself open more and come down with the ball and get your feet in you have to be even more aware of the boundary
2517432 it might change how some guys defend but i dont want to get it embedded in my brain so much that it changes he way i play on the sideline
2517433 id still rather play to attack the ball and if it gets to a situation where he is in the air and trying to get his foot down well then push him out
2517434 the offensive guys are going to complain about it but it really is about time the defense got one
2517435 but the thing is while we like the change theyre probably going to get more pass interference calls because of it
2517436 if we touch them before the ball is there theyll call us for that and officials are going to be looking for that the way they take care of the offense

2517438 my objection to the abolition of article 19 is mainly due to the governments argument that because of this article we are allegedly under international pressure we are internationally exposed how is this justified we allow rightfully the operation of muslim schools we allow the operation of a consulate in the area we have never resorted to any persecution are we the ones who should apologise and give evidence that we respect human rights or those who as we speak have sent settlers to cyprus and upset the population balance on the island the reason for the introduction of article 19 was not the behaviour of the large majority of the muslim population of thrace the reason was ankaras policy which attempted is attempting and will attempt for many years to use this minority against greece i am now asking the government has this reason expired

2517446 certain pass plays i knew i was in trouble because i knew i wasnt capable of throwing a 20 yard out if coach jon gruden called that play last year i wasnt able to manage it i was thinking of ways i was going to survive the game and at least move the team down the field somehow some way
2517447 i think it is another step but for some reason im not really as nervous for that as i was the first two days of practice

2517498 having a name and number on your boat and filing a float plan with a loved one friend or neighbor can increase your chances of being found if you are in trouble

2517503 labeling your boat with a name and phone number can help us make that determination more quickly
2517504 if there is no corresponding mayday call eye witness account or hit from a gps locating device we then look at whether the vessel shows obvious signs of neglect or non use
2517505 additionally we take steps to try to locate the owner such as calling businesses and marinas in the vicinity and asking them to check if theyre missing any of their vessels
2517506 with one phone call we couldve determined whether it was a false alarm or not
2517507 if it had been a true emergency the person on the other end of the phone may have known who was operating the vessel and given input on where to concentrate our search
2517508 its also important to keep the information on your boat current so we can call to find out where you may be
2517509 if the phone number changes draw a single line through the old number and write the new number below
2517510 bottom line is coast guard men and women are lifesavers
2517511 and we want to make sure our resources get to where theyre needed
2517512 the cost of fuel this year will probably cost me between 200 000 to 250 000 more than it did last year

2517540 no nada m s verme en el espejo no tengo nada de qu presumir
2517541 me gust porque no es una producci n estadounidense que ser a un orgullo participar en una de esas pero siempre se valora m s un esfuerzo latinoamericano y la otra fue porque como grab mis di logos sin ver ning n dibujo siempre me imagin a bianca en esta pel cula

2517554 we certainly didnt personally serve him prior to the match even though we believe his conduct and his statements are consistent with him knowing of it
2517555 therefore the court will be looking at future conduct rather than last night well be drawing it to the courts attention if he plays again

2517572 weve emphasised that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
2517573 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2517574 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
2517575 russia needs to support these efforts so that peace can be restored as quickly as possible
2517576 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2517577 russian military forces have gone through all the red lines by crossing an internationally recognised border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2517578 this is a clear act with visible elements of aggression and an outrageous violation of international law with grave consequences to regional and euro atlantic stability and security as well as to euro atlantic relations with russia
2517579 iran is ready to offer any help under its principal policies of contributing to the establishment of peace and stability in the region
2517580 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences
2517581 in the early summer dr aldhizer began to notice that his name had been signed on chart entries notes and prescriptions of patients in mcnamaras office

2517594 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2517595 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2517596 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important

2517600 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
2517601 so every time im working on it im really really happy

2517604 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2517605 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2517606 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2517607 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2517608 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2517609 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
2517610 we gained some confidence but know that the americans were at half strength
2517611 we have nothing to lose in this game all the pressure is on them
2517612 while some important progress has been made in recent years we share the frustration of the argentine jewish community that the perpetrators and collaborators of this heinous attack have not yet been brought to justice
2517613 in particular we are concerned that investigators have yet to identify and apprehend those inside argentina who assisted the terrorists
2517614 the combined shock of the atomic bombs and soviet entry pushed the japanese cabinet to the point where they could accept the unconditional end of the war but things happened so fast that theres really no way to tell whether one or the other would have been sufficient in isolation nor can we know for sure whether a conditional surrender could have been reached earlier because nobody tried very hard
2517615 the experience of the vietnam war in the united states
2517616 after the realization that the united states killed an obscene number of human beings with one bomb
2517617 ive said those words a thousand times just like any coach worth his salt knows that winning is the only thing that matters
2517618 one day not today not tomorrow not this season probably not next season either but one day you and i are gonna wake up and suddenly were gonna be like every other team in every other sport where winning is everything and nothing else matters and when that day comes well thats thats when well honor them
2517619 the u s must understand the strong relationship between drug production and terrorism and should therefore recognize the need for strict action against drug production in afghanistan the u s administration must redefine its priorities in afghanistan and realize that the elimination of drug economy is an issue of peace and stability and a sine qua non for its success in the war on terror
2517620 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week

2517626 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of with the bright lights of the olympics
2517627 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against china today as the olympics begin and with this action the voices of the tibetan people will be heard despite the best attempts of the chinese authorities to silence them
2517628 the chinese government will not be allowed to use the olympics to hide the reality of its harsh rule inside

2517772 how does it come to pass that with open bibles before them men and women should be wrong not so much about certain details with respect to the gospel but about the whole thing wrong about its foundation wrong about its central message wrong about its objective and wrong about how one comes into relationship with it

2517806 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2517807 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2517808 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2517809 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2517810 america has spoken candidly and consistently about our concerns over the chinese governments behavior
2517811 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential

2517813 they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2517814 beijing is covered in skyscrapers and filled with cars and the people of china have more connections to the world than ever before
2517815 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2517816 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia

2517857 but as a leader he is also responsible for ensuring that his and his supporters actions do not terminally damage the country he so desperately wants to lead
2517858 the single minded struggle to ensure that zuma moves into the union buildings has spawned a massive campaign of intimidation of the judiciary and other democratic institutions which looks set to dominate the political landscape over at least the medium term
2517859 if the anc president is really concerned about corruption in the government and within his party he should expose them whether he is put on trial or not as things stand the delaying tactics could work for now but the chickens could come home to roost if the issue is not dealt with speedily and expeditiously if by april next year there is no finality in the matter we could have a situation in which zuma is inaugurated with a cloud hanging over his head this will not be good news for our countrys image and reputation abroad
2517860 first jacob zuma begged for his day in court but now hes got it the anc president is trying every trick in the book to evade standing in the dock the newspaper said it was time that zuma showed some leadership and defends himself in court before he rips the country and its institutions to shreds

2517880 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2517881 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2517882 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2517883 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2517884 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2517885 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2517886 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2517887 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2517888 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2517889 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2517890 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2517891 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2517892 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2517893 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2517894 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2517895 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2517896 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2517897 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2517898 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2517899 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2517900 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2517901 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2517902 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2517903 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2517904 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2517905 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2517906 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2517907 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2517908 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2517909 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2517910 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2517911 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2517912 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2517913 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2517914 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2517915 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2517916 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2517930 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2517931 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2517932 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2517933 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2517934 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2517935 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2517936 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2517937 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2517938 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation

2517940 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2517941 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2517942 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2517943 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2517944 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2517945 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2517946 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2517947 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2517948 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2517949 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2517950 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2517951 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2517952 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2517953 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2517954 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2517955 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2517956 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2517957 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2517983 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2517984 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2517985 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2517986 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2517987 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2517988 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games

2517993 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2517994 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2517995 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian disaster is gathering pace

2518000 the creation of baggames began on a surf trip to tamarindo costa rica where the evenings were the perfect downtime to play backgammon
2518001 the problem was we didnt bring a game because no one wanted to lug around a full sized board in our already stuffed backpacks we could have brought along a travel version but who really likes playing with those tiny little pieces on a miniature board anyway no one in town had even heard of backgammon much less had one for sale our only option was to conjure up our own makeshift board we found a small sign company to draw up the board per our description and used colones costa rican currency for the checkers
2518002 there is so much conflicting information directed at the public about what to eat what is healthy what supplements to buy and what to do about various health diagnoses i felt it was important to get healthcare practitioners together to work as a team for each client we can now offer a comfortable setting to get reliable information to clients and to also give them tools and training for how to apply this knowledge in their daily lives

2518008 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006
2518009 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2518010 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2518011 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time

2518177 it was really a good game but its too bad to draw after the 94th minute and 25 seconds we kept putting pressure for 90 minutes and created some chances
2518178 we took the second goal at the last moment but we shouldnt have drawn 2 2 in the end we must keep our concentration until the very end

2518183 one of the most adjective candidates to arise in recent memory
2518184 barack obama is certainly mild superlative qualified to serve as president
2518185 regardless of what hillary and i said when she was running against him in the primaries after all hes more than 35 years old and its pretty likely that hes a u s citizen by birth constitutionally thats all you need
2518186 personally looking forward to president obamas administration for a term not to exceed four years after all 48 months is long enough to make your little statement about racial equality then we can get hillary in there while she still has enough estrogen to be considered the first woman president

2518189 sinds agbani de wereldtitel op haar naam zette vragen kleine meisjes mij hoe ze slank moeten worden
2518190 vroeger werden dikke meisjes benijd voor elke gram vet die zij meer hadden
2518191 sommige dikke meisjes dachten dat ze heel wat beter af waren dan mij maar agbani heeft dat allemaal veranderd
2518192 vergeleken met veel andere afrikaanse vrouwen stelt ze niet veel voor
2518193 de gemiddelde afrikaanse vrouw is robuust heeft brede heupen en een grote boezem vertelt hij
2518194 dat is wat ze te bieden heeft in termen van schoonheid dat is eigen aan onze cultuur
2518195 als je vroeger mager was dachten mensen dat je ziek was dat je een aidspati nt was of zo als je vandaag uit een familie van slanke mensen komt hoef je jezelf niet langer te schamen
2518196 door agbani zijn mensen gaan beseffen dat slank zijn mooi is

2518253 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact
2518254 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
2518255 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2518256 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2518257 in the way of running mates sen obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket

2518265 its going to be a tough one but im sure going to give him a run for his money
2518266 i do get a little bit jittery thinking about it
2518267 it was definitely on my mind a little bit it cant not be
2518268 to come back and swim a smart race im really happy with it
2518269 i dont want to be in lane four given to the fastest swimmer
2518270 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2518271 its always great to get the first race over and done with
2518272 but a few things went wrong there and still going in fastest qualifier for the semifinal its great to know that i have something to improve on
2518273 obviously having the heats at night shakes things up a little bit i know i have more than that in me
2518274 i didnt want to take any chances with the last heat going all best times leaving me out in the dust im going to have a double shot espresso tomorrow morning and ill be ready
2518275 i knew it would be quick but not quite that quick
2518276 we had some time to implement a plan and it went off
2518277 we were worried but i guess we had the tabloid gods looking down on us
2518278 by 8 or 9 youre doubting it youre going oh jeez this is ridiculous
2518279 he had this you know expression like the world just passed in front of his face he quickly did an about face went downstairs and ran into the mens restroom

2518291 we have been saying for years that we have to not only preserve our current fleet of nuclear plants but enlarge it significantly

2518293 you still have to mine the uranium used in the reactors and mining is a dirty polluting process and you have to store the nuclear waste somewhere waste that can be around for centuries sitting in a storage facility somewhere susceptible to leaks
2518294 the proposed yucca mountain nuclear waste dump is never going to open
2518295 i have successfully fought against the proposal to store nuclear waste in nevada for over two decades because it threatened the health and safety of nevadans and people across our nation

2518306 i disagree with the way the department is interpreting it the general assembly meant to severely restrict local regulation of oil and gas activities
2518307 to me it is a basic vindication that there is a role for the municipalities to play in regulating how oil and gas regulation gets done in their municipalities

2518349 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2518350 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2518351 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home

2518353 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2518354 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games
2518355 in practical terms the shift means dumping glossy madison avenue campaigns about america in favor of helping target populations find alternatives to extremism in everything from politics and technology to sports and religion

2518364 in the way of running mates sen obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2518365 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2518366 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2518367 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq

2518380 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2518381 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris

2518536 im sure the mayors family is going to be very happy to have the mayor back home
2518537 the mayor says that he serves god and he speaks to god and hes chosen by god so hopefully those who also say that they have been chosen by god if they speak to him then maybe god will speak to the mayor and he will step down
2518538 i do personally think it is far past time for the business community to speak up on this matter
2518539 it is past time for religious leadership to join those leaders that have spoken up i just think the mayor needs to hear that as talented and charismatic as he is its over its time to let it go
2518540 detroit needs and deserves a mayor who is fully engaged in the business of the city and who is able to lead with credibility and authority

2518570 through the tragic experience of the delezio family we have been reminded of the vulnerability of our young and our obligation to protect and care for them mr iemma also said
2518571 the money will be put to good use because it provides funding for specialised medical treatment ongoing research outpatient rehabilitation and community education
2518572 i am here to protect and serve now serve me or you will be arrested for resisting arrest
2518573 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
2518574 it needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problem and not contributing to it
2518575 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518576 the first thing needed is to make the georgians return to their positions and re establish the status quo we had before
2518577 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518578 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518579 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2518580 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2518581 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2518582 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2518583 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2518584 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518585 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2518586 i do solemnly swear to discharge the responsibility required of me to the best of my abilities and faithfully serve the people of wales whom i here represent
2518587 do not think that i came to bring peace on the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword

2518591 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518592 iran has the right to have a peaceful nuclear program
2518593 the west should try to find a solution to the iranian nuclear issue through political and diplomatic settlement
2518594 the language of deadline setting is not understandable to us we gave them our response within a month as we said we would now they have to reply to us
2518595 concluded in the unsc united nations security council and fully and completely returned to the agency the international atomic energy agency
2518596 we postulated that the president of the united states actually took the advice of the iraq study group seriously and tried to engage diplomatically with iran
2518597 im fighting two wars and i dont need a third one
2518598 theres a real danger of any strike not only causing more instability in the region than there already is
2518599 but of actually having the opposite effect of what you want
2518600 generals are more willing to push back against things they think are stupid and gates is more willing to listen
2518601 mullen isnt just saying these things for our benefit i think it is a real effort to communicate with the civilian leadership
2518602 there are lots of opinions about where were headed with iran and a lot of healthy discussion
2518603 but to set the debate along the lines of to bomb or not to bomb isnt a fair characterization
2518604 the views the secretary has expressed on this issue are entirely his own and they are entirely consistent with his colleagues in the administration
2518605 theres a lot about iran that we still just dont understand
2518606 a lot of generals are saying are you sure you really want to do this
2518607 unless its happened in the deepest recesses of the pentagon ive never been involved in a war game that seriously considered a land invasion of iran
2518608 the no 1 problem we have is where are the targets we still have trouble accurately locating all of the pieces of the nuclear program that we need to take out in order to have a relatively decisive effect
2518609 the strait is always the key for war games in the gulf
2518610 nobodys underestimating irans ability to disrupt access to the strait
2518611 people brush over the tanker wars but the navy hasnt forgotten
2518612 they said hezbollah is the a team and not someone we want to take on because they were essentially 10 or 15 times the capability of al qaeda
2518613 conveyed his less than enthusiastic view of an israeli attack
2518614 from an iranian perspective israel would be flying american made f 15s and f 16s dropping bombs made in the usa
2518615 within the pentagon not only do they see the downsides they tend to think that if someones going to do this they dont want to see it outsourced to another air force
2518616 i dont know whether that keeps an operation from happening olmert may want to do this one thing on his way out
2518617 i for one am convinced that its a very real possibility
2518618 regionally there was very strong interest in limiting irans growth and power that we havent exploited as a country
2518619 we could get small concessions and promises to talk again
2518620 but there were no significant breakthroughs or eurekas that made us say this idea is so wonderful that we need to run down the hall and try it right now
2518621 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518622 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2518623 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518624 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation but that was rejected
2518625 proposed within the united states government in 1962 the plan called for cia or other operatives to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in u s cities to create public support for a war against castro led cuba
2518626 operation northwoods was drafted by the joint chiefs of staff and signed by then chairman lyman lemnitzer and sent to the secretary of defense
2518627 it included plans for hijackings and bombings followed by the use of phony evidence that would blame the terrorist acts on foreign governments reply 491 on today at 02 34 25 am reply 492 on today at 06 27 49 am how about some truth mullahs and nukes do not mix wmds do not mix
2518628 we have the courage to correspond with our main allies for what we see as in the interest of kuwait and the region
2518629 it is true that we are allies of america however we are against escalation against iran over its nuclear program
2518630 merely talking about such a closure creates a state of tension and will raise the insurance costs on vessels passing through
2518631 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2518632 if the macedonians had not become the shield protecting the lands beyond mount olympus by the continuous barbarian attacks the greek element would not be preserved uninterrupted for so many centuries
2518633 arent all our powerful locations placed in the hands of this man will we not suffer the most awful humiliation are we not already at war with him isnt he our enemy isnt he in possession of our lands isnt he a barbarian doesnt he deserve all this name calling
2518634 it is said that the race of the two colt chariot was won by a woman named velestihi from the seashores of macedonia
2518635 in the grove there is the records building and an edifice called phippeion philip built it after the battle at chaeroneia there are statues of philip of alexander and amyntas there are pieces that were made of ivory and gold carved by leoharus just like the statues of olympia and euridice
2518636 representing the macedonians the inhabitants of dion a city by the macedonian pieria mountain range had a statue made which portrays apollo holding a deer
2518637 all of asia civilized by alexander the great was reading homer and euripides as well as sophocles tragedies

2518648 art is good and the commercial and nonprofit sectors alone will not provide enough of it unless there is additional support from the state
2518649 well of course asking for more funds to support arts outreach programs in schools in poor neighborhoods is not the same as asking congress not to implement a carbon tax or stringent fuel efficiency guidelines

2518654 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2518655 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2518656 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2518657 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2518658 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2518659 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2518660 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2518661 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2518662 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2518663 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2518664 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2518665 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2518666 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2518679 the big sound of the 12 string guitar made its full impact only on electrical recordings and if barbecue bob was not the first player to profit from that innovation he was certainly the first to do so on a national the thunder of his bass notes and strummed lower strings was pierced by darts of lightning as he touched the high strings often with slide
2518680 intial sales were so good that hicks was called to new york in the middle of june to record 8 more numbers and when columbia returned to atlanta in november they not only recorded a further 8 selections by barbecue bob but also 6 by his brother charley lincoln who sang the same sort of songs in very much the same style

2518702 meine pfarrei und ich waren in unserer kleinen kirche nicht weit von hier versammelt wir bereiteten uns auf die messe vor als uniformierte die kirche betraten
2518703 es war 11 uhr 40 sie haben mich umzingelt und dann nach drau en geschleppt
2518704 sie waren vor angst wie gel hmt und konnten nichts tun
2518705 wir waren unter st ndiger aufsicht sobald ich die augen schlo oder aufh rte zu reden glaubten meine w chter ich w rde beten und begannen mich zu schlagen
2518706 doch kann ich mich nicht mehr daran erinnern wann sie aufh rten
2518707 ich wei nur noch da die w nde voller blut waren als sie meine zelle wieder verlie en
2518708 sie haben mich auch gefoltert einmal zwanzig n chte hintereinander ich habe sie gez hlt
2518709 als wir in einem raum mit betonboden ankamen lie en sie mich mit den knien auf geschliffene metallplatten fallen die so scharf waren wie rasierklingen
2518710 dann banden sie mir einen sack an den hals der so schwer war da ich kaum noch atmen konnte und lie en mich in dieser stellung f r stunden zur ck
2518711 ich durfte weder die augen schlie en noch aufh ren zu reden damit sie sicher gehen konnten da ich nicht betete

2518795 this claim is based on extremely well tested theories of physics and on observations of the cosmos

2518797 basically devoid of what current educational research has consistently identified as best practices for instruction
2518798 its not about the terrorists its about us its about what kind of country we are
2518799 is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad
2518800 the signing statement is saying i will only comply with this law when i want to and if something arises in the war on terrorism where i think its important to torture or engage in cruel inhuman and degrading conduct i have the authority to do so and nothing in this law is going to stop me
2518801 the cia should have the ability to use additional techniques

2518803 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
2518804 prosecution of any officials if it were to occur would probably not occur during obamas first term
2518805 instead we may well see a congressionally empowered commission that would seek testimony from witnesses in search of the truth about what occurred though some witnesses might be offered immunity in exchange for testimony the question of whether anybody would be prosecuted would be deferred to a later date meaning obamas second term if such is forthcoming
2518806 the commission would focus strictly on detention torture and extraordinary rendition or the practice of spiriting detainees to a third country for abusive interrogations the panel would focus strictly on these abuses leaving out any other allegedly illegal activities during the bush administration such as domestic spying

2518818 georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms
2518819 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
2518820 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
2518821 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

2518828 oh well i think the on ice portion has made some great strides in opening up the game since the lockout season i have always felt going way back that our league has the best players not only from north america but from the world to allow these guys to show off their talents and display what they can do on thin blades with the puck and force other players in the league to emulate them and elevate their level will make our game better i have never been a fan of allowing the other players to pull down the more skilled guys and in the last few years the game has gotten faster and there are plays that people are just shaking their heads at on the other side the challenge will always be keeping that financial balance the players deserve to make a good living at what they do and the franchises and owners deserve to make money for their investment and risk you have to find that happy medium and do it so youre not alienating the fans at the same time
2518829 im probably at least six to eight months of two or three a days away im very content watching the young guys my hats off to chris chelios for doing what he does for a guy that played against him its great to see him out there competing and still having success i cant right now and i have no desire to

2518836 for myself its important that i play football because as part of my learning curve i need to be playing if i dont play im not learning
2518837 obviously i would love to be played in my position which is centre forward

2518840 the club is presently involved in preliminary discussions with football federation australia and has been invited to present its formal proposal for the licence later this month

2518844 i hope the injury situation is all over with now i felt like i had to work through the summer this year i just wanted to get myself firing for the start of the season
2518845 its been really frustrating over the last couple of years
2518846 i have played in english football for four seasons now
2518847 three of those seasons have been fantastic but 65 per cent of last year was rubbish
2518848 the goal is of course to become a better player and to do as well as possible

2518861 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2518862 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2518863 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2518864 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2518865 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2518866 yeah i cant move my legs and i talk like corky muh fuh thatcher but it was the other guys fault

2518872 la respuesta es clara cuando un ojo apunta a un objetivo solo queda un ojo libre con el cual hallar el camino
2518873 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2518874 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2518875 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2518892 that the state must be separated from the church is a thesis absolutely false a most pernicious error an obvious negation of the supernatural order
2518893 its a miracle that were even in this room as democrats but were not here for show were here for work
2518894 their story has powerful resonance for our own time in confronting the berlin blockade america went to battle against a destructive ideology that threatened free people around the world in a country we invaded and occupied that had never had a stable democracy we brought freedom and turned their peoples hatred of america into love for this country its people and its ideals
2518895 get germany off the american taxpayers back was the call of conservatives in congress
2518896 by changing the amount of traveling we do purchasing vehicles with higher fuel efficiency and adopting low carbon fuel standards we can exceed the goals that the minnesota legislature has put before us and be a leader in the nation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2518897 this study provides a great starting point for the 2009 legislative session and will help facilitate a thorough debate and good policy development to create cost effective solutions and improve minnesotas energy security
2518898 the technology to make this happen exists it is just a matter of using it
2518899 the engines we use in our cars are no worse or better than the engines they have in passenger cars in japan or germany the difference is we put our engines in enormous cars
2518900 i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean

2518902 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive
2518903 just as we did not fall under sin on our own account or by our own actions so too we are not saved by our own efforts or actions it is the faith of christ even unto death not our personal faith in christ that saves us from eternal death he is the savior not we ourselves
2518904 for god has consigned all men to disobedience that he may have mercy upon all
2518905 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified

2518918 the risk in the study of ancient individuals is to attribute to the fossil specimen the dna left there by archaeologists or biologists who manipulated it
2518919 to avoid that we followed all phases of the retrieval of the fossil bones and typed the dna sequences of all people who had any contacts with them
2518920 the paglicci 23 individual carried a mtdna sequence that is still common in europe and which radically differs from those of the almost contemporary neandertals demonstrating a genealogical continuity across 28 000 years from cro magnoid to modern europeans

2518980 las bases no suenan bien las primeras notas desafinan ni tocan la partitura estatutaria ni parecen la m sica adecuada
2518981 no nos levantaremos de la mesa dejando la silla vac a para buscar una nueva mesa incierta y lejana
2518982 esperaremos y trabajaremos para que hay nuevas bases y nuevas propuestas sobre las cuales edificar un espacio propio para catalu a dentro de una nueva arquitectura

2518990 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2518991 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2518992 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2518993 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2518994 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2518995 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2518996 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2518997 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2518998 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2518999 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2519000 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2519001 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2519002 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social

2519004 i had to spend fifteen minutes and a jumbo packet of schitoff cleaning up after your last visit now what do you want
2519005 no i just mean that she found a way of passing matter through matter without molesting either
2519006 if your theory is correct and its one that i find most attractive rather like yourself despite your tail i wonder if we might find evidence of it in the stinging nettle patch that lies just behind this freezer
2519007 but havent the police gone over everywhere with a fine tooth comb already
2519008 they went over it with size twelve boots the worthless scum all evidence will have been crushed beneath them
2519009 what fabulous fun she must be having teleporting herself all over the place like that
2519010 i shall join the fight against the oppression unfairness and general ghastliness that i have discovered in this foul land of prannick the wheel is absolutely rotten i dont like it its exponents are total bastards who deserve to either die horribly or get sent to some putrid place of slime and unpleasantness where their fingernails will crack and their reproductive organs will atrophy into uselessness
2519011 i just overheard two passing wood mice talking about a stix meeting being held in some place called kinell if cavies get to vote im raising my paw to the suggestion that we get our bored asses outta here
2519012 theyre built on opposite banks of the turgid river did they mention which kinell
2519013 now how the hell am i supposed to know that
2519014 its more than three hop skip and jumps to the woodland track i could barely make out a word of what they said are they north and south or east and west
2519015 those sure are dumb names i guess he musta been talkin bout far kinell yeah the stix meetings in far kinell
2519016 i know of a short cut there via 96 and old drainage pipe if we move muy r pido we can arrive before the caf con leche and buttered scones are shared out during the intermission
2519017 i havent enjoyed the texture of a buttered scone since nanny used one to placate me that time when she was forced to smear an unpleasant balm upon my chafed privates after id indulged in some tactile experimentation inside a chain mail jerkin but lets not get into that right now if its stix time then im ready to do my bit and let no rodent dare stand in my way
2519018 oh how i curse those ancient drainage pipe builders for making them so small and regard my brass helmet everyone its got all scratched by the low ceiling
2519019 some will tell you that the wheel brings peace and prosperity to prannick that as a direct result of its rule we have equality for all rodents but is this true
2519020 it was a rhetorical question flossy we all know the answer to it its no
2519021 since youre so keen to slag off the wheel in public what you had to say about what they say about our chattels its a reasonable enough question though perhaps not particularly pertinent
2519022 youre bloody right it aint pertinent ya daft old bastard
2519023 were supposed to be rabble rousing not having a reasonable discussion concerning the merits of the autocracy that rules us with an iron paw now shut up or go fluff yourself
2519024 a hamster after my own heart i like this fellow though not in a sexual sort of way of course
2519025 i say i think ive seen this fellow nosing about in the market place 99 does anyone know who he is
2519026 listen to him calling me a twerp thats a sure sign of a law master spy i reckon lets hang him up from the nearest rhubarb tree by his scrotum
2519027 what and countenance the actions of the wheel we are stix sir we desire nothing more than justice throughout our realm only logic and honest evidence shall convict you
2519028 its the forces of the wheel run run for your lives
2519029 bring all the known stix to me the rest take them to far kinell town hall incarcerate them with inconsolable misery make their 102 bindings hurt or take away their chairs that sort of thing i want them all to suffer in some form or other empty the snack bar and douse the fire in the range make it all nasty and smoky for them yes and have the toilets blocked too let them wallow in their own filth

2519051 the worlds leading independent organisation for medical humanitarian aid annually more than 3 000 volunteer doctors nurses and support staff work in trouble spots around the world helping those living on the edge of human tolerance
2519052 m decins sans fronti res teams are currently in over 70 countries working with more than 25 000 locally recruited national staff in conditions that are always challenging sometimes dangerous
2519053 wherever our teams are working their goal is the same to provide essential medical humanitarian aid to those who need it most regardless of race religion gender or political affiliation
2519054 we provide relief after natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes
2519055 m decins sans fronti res was formed in 1971 by a group of french doctors who had previously worked with famine victims caught in the biafra conflict the civil war of nigeria 1967 1970
2519056 they aimed to establish a lean independent organisation that would focus on emergency medicine speak out about the causes of human suffering and cut through red tape to deliver aid fast and effectively
2519057 m decins sans fronti res is an international movement with a network of sections in 18 countries
2519058 in 1999 m decins sans fronti res was awarded the nobel peace prize

2519082 i know i should act like i have it all together and it doesnt faze me that i am meeting you but i just want to jump up and down clap my hands and say mary carol garrity
2519083 i wish my family at home was this excited to see me
2519084 the best way to get even with a jerk is to take their money
2519085 how am i going to incorporate bright yellow oriental balls and a ceramic dog sculpture into a pleasing configuration
2519086 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2519087 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2519088 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2519089 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2519090 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2519091 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2519092 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2519093 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2519094 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2519095 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2519096 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2519097 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2519098 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2519099 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2519100 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2519101 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2519102 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2519103 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2519104 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2519105 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2519106 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2519107 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2519108 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2519109 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2519110 el presidente me dijo que le permiti ramos jugar ahora en su capital pero que construir a un estadio nuevo

2519117 when the earthquake happened the ground went up and down up and down
2519118 and then from left to right the stairway broke and collapsed i tried to rescue patients out of here
2519119 i dashed out of the building and i just narrowly escaped
2519120 erm yes you said shed had problems and i thought
2519121 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2519122 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2519123 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2519124 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2519125 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2519126 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2519127 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2519128 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2519129 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2519130 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2519131 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2519132 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2519133 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2519134 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2519135 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2519136 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2519137 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2519138 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2519139 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2519140 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2519141 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2519142 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2519143 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2519144 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2519145 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2519146 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2519147 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2519148 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2519149 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2519150 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2519151 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2519152 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2519153 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2519154 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2519155 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2519156 who are open to doing something on the production side
2519157 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2519158 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2519159 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2519160 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2519161 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2519162 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2519163 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2519164 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2519165 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2519166 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2519167 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2519168 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2519169 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2519170 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2519171 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2519172 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2519173 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2519174 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2519175 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2519176 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2519177 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2519178 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2519179 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2519217 it is impossible to reason a man out of something he has not been reasoned into when people have acquired their beliefs on an emotional level they cannot be persuaded out of them on a rational level no matter how strong the proof or logic behind it people will hold onto their emotional beliefs and twist the facts to meet their version of reality

2519220 the thrust of the biblical testimony and the purpose of creation is uniquely centred on this earth
2519221 i think there isnt a contradiction just as there is a multiplicity of creatures over the earth so there could be other beings even intelligent beings created by god this is not in contradiction with our faith because we cannot establish limits to gods creative freedom to say it with st francis if we can consider some earthly creatures as brothers or sisters why could we not speak of a brother alien he would also belong to the creation
2519222 the alien race could have remained in full friendship with the creator
2519223 the dark side is real because evil actions are real sentience gave rise to the dark side does the dark side exist in nature no left to itself nature maintains the balance but weve changed that we sentient beings are a new order of consciousness that has an impact on all life the force now contains light and dark because of what thinking beings have brought to it thats why balance has become something that must be maintained because our actions have the power to tip the scales
2519224 about four years ago i began to have fundamental doubts about the validity of the scientific methods icr was using to achieve their data and support the presupposed conclusion that god created the heavens and the earth no more than 10 000 years ago
2519225 it was out of respect for my father and his legacy that i chose not to reveal my doubts at that time but now two years after his passing in february 2006 enough time has elapsed that i feel comfortable announcing my resignation as icr president

2519288 we understand youre out of work how tragic tell us darling what happened
2519289 well i guess you could say i just lost faith in my employer over the past few years i liked my manager i liked my team i may have shown up late from time to time but i always gave them a good days work and held myself to standards that exceeded all expectations sadly it wasnt meant to last due to recent competitive threats cost cutting changes in upper management and the natural changes in policy that go with such restructering i found i just couldnt be happy its a shame because i used to really enjoy working there i used to truly respect them but when the company loses sight of the people the community and the heart that made it special in the first place all in favor of focusing solely on dollars and cents a lot of questionable decisions get made a lot of employees start to lose faith i among them so i started thinking of the long road and decided it was best to move on no hard feelings i wish the entire company the best of luck i would just like to find work in something less material and more emotionally satisfying

2519300 its such a tough golf course that they dont need to trick it up
2519301 the fairways are running 30 to 40 yards the greens are like concrete its not enjoyable to play theyve taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap
2519302 but it seems like we have this 15 times a year
2519303 nothing is ever going to get as tough as royal birkdale you could put an asterisk next to it
2519304 when youre playing a par 3 you should have a chance if you strike a good shot to get it somewhere within 15 feet
2519305 the only way to keep it on the green is to hit 75 feet away
2519306 i personally am ok except for being a little sore and not having a chance to properly rest because of being needed to help others which i dont mind

2519323 a critical mass of john edwardss lgbt steering committee is going public with support for sen barack obama over sen hillary clinton twenty two members of the edwards campaigns original 59 person gay and lesbian committee will now be working for obama victories next tuesday and throughout the rest of the primary season the new obama converts include eric stern who headed up edwardss lgbt steering committee and longtime gay activist david mixner who famously campaigned for bill clinton in 1992 holding some of the first gay fund raisers for a u s presidential candidate
2519324 its time to live up to our founding promise of equality by treating all our citizens with dignity and respect lets enact federal civil rights legislation to outlaw hate crimes and protect workers against discrimination based upon sexual orientation and gender identity or expression
2519325 we are ready to accomplish these goals because of the courage and persistence of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people who have been working every day to achieve equal rights the gay couple who demand equal treatment in our family laws as they raise their children the lesbian soldier who wants nothing more than to serve her country openly and honestly the transgender workers who ask for the simple dignity of being judged by the quality of their work generations of lgbt americans at once ordinary and extraordinary have made possible this moment in our history with leadership and hard work we can fulfill the promise of equality for all
2519326 there are some situations so obvious that you almost feel you dont have to comment upon them then you wake up one morning and realize not only should you have expressed your opinion but you should have done it loudly and resoundingly and repeatedly the odious concept of former georgia senator sam nunn serving on a ticket with senator obama is one of those situations
2519327 i would be virtually useless in trying to convince other gays and lesbians to support the ticket
2519328 it was heartbreaking to learn about lawrence kings death and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family kings senseless death is a tragic example of the corrosive effect that bigotry and fear can have in our society its also an urgent reminder that we need to do more in our schools to foster tolerance and an acceptance of diversity that we must enact a federal hate crimes law that protects all lgbt americans and that we must recommit ourselves to becoming active and engaged parents citizens and neighbors so that bias and bigotry cannot take hold in the first place we all have a responsibility to help this nation live up to its founding promise of equality for all
2519329 if you are elected president what concrete steps would you take to overturn dont ask dont tell
2519330 moving from one candidate to another is never an easy process
2519331 but the times demand that we all participate fully and completely to bring about change originally my support went to senator edwards because of the war in iraq for the very same reason i am supporting senator obama this is not even a close call for me
2519332 their outreach was as aggressive and as sincere its been a difficult choice for many of us
2519333 it became clear to me personally that our committee had a vision for the role of the lgbt community that was similar to the role that lgbt supporters were already playing in the obama campaign
2519334 thus far its clear that we will play a similar role in the obama campaign
2519335 we believe that obama can pick up more delegates if the 12 15 of edwards supporters nationwide and even more in some states will turn out for obama
2519336 this vote was about who we are as americans and whether this nation is going to live up to its founding promise of equality those who commit hate crimes should be punished no matter whether those crimes are committed on account of race gender religion disability or sexual orientation todays vote is a victory for all of us in upholding basic rights and protections in this country i urge the president to reconsider his veto threat and support this legislation passing this bill will help us live up to the principle that in this country we treat all of our citizens with dignity and respect
2519337 we are all sick because of aids and we are all tested by this crisis it is a test not only of our willingness to respond but of our ability to look past the artificial divisions and debates that have often shaped that response when you go to places like africa and you see this problem up close you realize that its not a question of either treatment or prevention or even what kind of prevention it is all of the above it is not an issue of either science or values it is both yes there must be more money spent on this disease but there must also be a change in hearts and minds in cultures and attitudes neither philanthropist nor scientist neither government nor church can solve this problem on their own aids must be an all hands on deck effort
2519338 barack believes that lgbt americans with partners from other countries should not be faced with a choice between staying with their partner and staying in their country thats why he supports changing immigration policy through the uniting american families act he does however have some reservations about the fraud provisions of the present bill
2519339 pride month is a reminder that while we have come a long way since the stonewall riots in 1969 we still have a lot of work to do
2519340 too often the issue of lgbt rights is exploited by those seeking to divide us but at its core this issue is about who we are as americans its about whether this nation is going to live up to its founding promise of equality by treating all its citizens with dignity and respect
2519341 its time to turn the page on the bitterness and bigotry that fill so much of todays lgbt rights debate
2519342 this pride month lets make our founding promise of equality a reality for every american
2519343 funny how obama is a big supporter of civil rights when blacks are being maligned but not so much when gays are the victims kind of puts his screw up over general paces homophobia in a whole new light
2519344 mcclurkin believes one can pray away the gay that it is a choice and according to keith boykin donnie mcclurkin compares gays and lesbians to liars
2519345 we strongly urge obama to part ways with this divisive preacher who is clearly singing a different tune than the stated message of the campaign
2519346 we can only hope that obama is unaware of mcclurkins anti gay history and will swiftly condemn such intolerance real leadership includes standing up to those who drive wedges between the american people
2519347 i have clearly stated my belief that gays and lesbians are our brothers and sisters and should be provided the respect dignity and rights of all other citizens i have consistently spoken directly to african american religious leaders about the need to overcome the homophobia that persists in some parts of our community so that we can confront issues like hiv aids and broaden the reach of equal rights in this country i strongly believe that african americans and the lgbt community must stand together in the fight for equal rights and so i strongly disagree with reverend mcclurkins views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the united states to ensure that america is a country that spreads tolerance instead of division
2519348 in ten zip code areas with well known heavily gay neighborhoods in seven cities clinton took in 51 percent of contributions made to the top three democrats as reported in the april quarterly report made available by the federal elections commission this week obama raked in 39 percent and john edwards 10 percent in ann arbors zip code of 48104 clinton took 68 percent of the money given to the top three democrats followed by obama with 20 percent and edwards with 12
2519349 we appreciate the strong statements from senators clinton and obama following the aggressive campaign undertaken by our members donors and staff over the last several days
2519350 most democrats understand that morality isnt derived from sexual orientation or gender identity democrats should also understand that our families must no longer be seen as a liability on the campaign trail but as positive partners within the american community our members aggressively communicated that message to both campaigns this past week we now look forward to helping all of our democratic candidates further engage our community and better vocalize their support for all americans regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity
2519351 ive heard from a number of my friends and ive certainly clarified with them any misunderstanding that anyone had because i disagree with general pace completely i do not think homosexuality is immoral
2519352 i do not agree with general pace that homosexuality is immoral attempts to divide people like this have consumed too much of our politics over the past six years
2519353 i think traditionally the joint chiefs of staff chairman has restricted his public comments to military matters thats probably a good tradition to follow
2519354 i think the question here is whether somebody is willing to sacrifice for their country should they be able to if theyre doing all the things that should be done

2519584 the tribunal rejected mr alis argument that mr moi had been one of the remaining big men of africa who under the one party state constitution was entitled to say like louis xiv that he was the state as unfounded since under kenyan and english law which mr ali was relying on the president was regarded as being bound by the law and the constitution
2519585 with the aid of mathematics we have analyzed all of the variations suggested to resolve the problem of state debt with actual interest rates or reduced interest rates with new credits or without new credits with limited payments associated to export levels or without such limits with moratoria or without moratoria and even on the assumption of a sustained accelerated rate of development that is itself utopian the result of all of these analyses is that sovereign debt like an enormous and monstrous cancer whose malignant cells reproduce at an accelerating rate tends to reproduce itself and grow without limit
2519586 there is a bit of everything depression in some countries inflation in others formulas and measures for destabilizing governments everyone on earth now understands that the imf for all the states it seeks to help for all the states that it pretends to help actually drowns those states economically and destabilizes them politically there is no better way to put it than that the aid of the imf is the devils kiss
2519587 the debts of the countries with less relative development in a disadvantaged situation are unbearable and do not have a solution and they should be canceled the indebtedness is financially overwhelming the rest of the developing countries and that burden should be eased the economic gap between developed countries and those countries which want to develop instead of becoming smaller is increasing and should be eliminated
2519588 and what is that which can give us that strength unity and what can provoke that unity debt the most immediate problem crisis catastrophe logic posits given that we are on the edge of the precipice and must chose between struggle or death that we decided to struggle against the debt that is why this is a strategy it is not about a slogan we gather everything around the debt the countries of latin america and the third world with that force we can liquidate the debt we can liquidate it to liquidate does not mean to pay it rather to erase it
2519589 1 without the consent of the people 2 not for the benefit of the people and 3 both of the above with the knowledge of the creditors
2519590 the argument is that just as individuals do not have to repay if others illegitimately borrow in their name the population of a country is not responsible for loans taken out by an illegitimate government that did not have the right to borrow in its name
2519591 instruct the united states executive director of each international financial institution to use the voice and vote of the united states to oppose the admission of cuba
2519592 although anastasio somoza was reported to have looted 100 million to 500 million from nicaragua by the time he was overthrown in 1979 and the sandinista leader daniel ortega told the united nations general assembly that his government would repudiate somozas debt the sandinistas reconsidered when their allies in cuba advised them that repudiating the debt would unwisely alienate them from western capitalist countries
2519593 t here is nothing alien or even novel in proposing to use private law concepts to articulate limits on the legitimate powers of states
2519594 i llegitimate debt is not yet a well defined and generally accepted term differences between illegitimate and other types of debts such as odious or legal debts must be clarified

2519598 inability to love is the central problem because that inability masks a certain terror and that terror is the terror of being touched and if you cant be touched you cant be changed and if you cant be changed you cant be alive
2519599 cynics build no bridges they make no discoveries no gaps are spanned by them cynics may pride themselves in being realistic in their approach but progress and the onward march of civilization demand an inspiration and motivation that cynicism never affords
2519600 it is not okay in this culture to talk to friends about causes you believe in much less to ask them to join in its okay to blast perfect strangers with crass messages every hour of the day but its a tinge embarrassing it brings up some shyness it seems an intrusion it risks rejection to share real heartfelt commitments its easier to share our cynicism with strangers than our dreams with friends one is not allowed in the modern culture to speak about love except in the most romantic and trivial sense of the word the deepest difference between optimists and pessimists is their position in the debate about whether human beings are able to operate collectively from a basis of love seek out and trust in the best human instincts in yourself and in everyone listen to the cynicism around you and pity those who believe it but dont believe it yourself
2519601 to learn and to love that is what we are here for any activity which is not grounded in one of these two is a waste of time
2519602 his siblings and others of his community fly at him peck at him torment him they mean to chase him away and the ugly duckling is heartbroken to be rejected by his own it is a terrible thing especially since he did nothing to warrant it other than look different and act different while exile is not a thing to desire for the fun of it there is an unexpected gain from it the gifts of exile are many it takes out weakness by the pounding it removes whininess enables acute insight heightens intuition and grants the power of keen observation and perspective that the insider can never achieve
2519603 an optimist is a person who sees only the lights in the picture whereas a pessimist sees only the shadows an idealist however is one who sees the light and the shadows but in addition sees something else the possibility of changing the picture of making the lights prevail over the shadows
2519604 heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the trouble makers the round heads in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them but the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do

2519627 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
2519628 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
2519629 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2519698 hey doody can you pass me the three bean salad
2519699 clell i am a professional woman now and i would appreciate it we could speak of something else at this juncture
2519700 listen you little the next time you say something like that in front of company im going to rip off your and hit you with the bloody stump of it got it
2519701 any closer and we would surely be in the grasp of the law masters paws no
2519702 why should we creep like fugitives in the shadows for we
2519703 surely you wouldnt turn away a member of the condom purveyors guild without sustenance and a moments rest
2519704 ive got lizard pie and some rough ale will that do
2519705 i wont soil it or anything i wont leave any unsightly smears its just that i have a slight problem in my underpants i think theres a couple of minute life forms in there and id rather like to set them free
2519706 you do have one i suppose you might know it as the room of many tinkles
2519707 we have to get out of here theres a danger so great that its palpable
2519708 rootley you are young and nimble brother alfonso you are vast and so physically imposing that you could probably club them into submission with your willy and i am trained in all sorts of fisticuffs and wear the shield of righteousness about me they are armed with nothing more terrifying than cudgels i say we fight them
2519709 what 112 do you want if its non reproductive sexual intercourse i should warn you that im probably really awful at it there must be so many local maidens who do it all the time in any case theres still a load of leaf litter down there you might catch something nasty
2519710 wendy nuthatch i live in belchers pond i have three brothers all from the same litter their names are cuthbert captain thrudsday and the 113 unstoppable gherkin
2519711 youre not worth enough to finance a complete redecoration but i should be able to fix the door and replace a few chairs
2519712 just as long as i dont have to eat any more custard
2519713 i had to spend fifteen minutes and a jumbo packet of schitoff cleaning up after your last visit now what do you want
2519714 no i just mean that she found a way of passing matter through matter without molesting either
2519715 if your theory is correct and its one that i find most attractive rather like yourself despite your tail i wonder if we might find evidence of it in the stinging nettle patch that lies just behind this freezer
2519716 but havent the police gone over everywhere with a fine tooth comb already
2519717 they went over it with size twelve boots the worthless scum all evidence will have been crushed beneath them
2519718 what fabulous fun she must be having teleporting herself all over the place like that
2519719 i shall join the fight against the oppression unfairness and general ghastliness that i have discovered in this foul land of prannick the wheel is absolutely rotten i dont like it its exponents are total bastards who deserve to either die horribly or get sent to some putrid place of slime and unpleasantness where their fingernails will crack and their reproductive organs will atrophy into uselessness
2519720 i just overheard two passing wood mice talking about a stix meeting being held in some place called kinell if cavies get to vote im raising my paw to the suggestion that we get our bored asses outta here
2519721 theyre built on opposite banks of the turgid river did they mention which kinell
2519722 now how the hell am i supposed to know that
2519723 its more than three hop skip and jumps to the woodland track i could barely make out a word of what they said are they north and south or east and west
2519724 those sure are dumb names i guess he musta been talkin bout far kinell yeah the stix meetings in far kinell
2519725 i know of a short cut there via 96 and old drainage pipe if we move muy r pido we can arrive before the caf con leche and buttered scones are shared out during the intermission
2519726 i havent enjoyed the texture of a buttered scone since nanny used one to placate me that time when she was forced to smear an unpleasant balm upon my chafed privates after id indulged in some tactile experimentation inside a chain mail jerkin but lets not get into that right now if its stix time then im ready to do my bit and let no rodent dare stand in my way
2519727 oh how i curse those ancient drainage pipe builders for making them so small and regard my brass helmet everyone its got all scratched by the low ceiling
2519728 some will tell you that the wheel brings peace and prosperity to prannick that as a direct result of its rule we have equality for all rodents but is this true
2519729 it was a rhetorical question flossy we all know the answer to it its no
2519730 since youre so keen to slag off the wheel in public what you had to say about what they say about our chattels its a reasonable enough question though perhaps not particularly pertinent
2519731 youre bloody right it aint pertinent ya daft old bastard
2519732 were supposed to be rabble rousing not having a reasonable discussion concerning the merits of the autocracy that rules us with an iron paw now shut up or go fluff yourself
2519733 a hamster after my own heart i like this fellow though not in a sexual sort of way of course
2519734 i say i think ive seen this fellow nosing about in the market place 99 does anyone know who he is
2519735 listen to him calling me a twerp thats a sure sign of a law master spy i reckon lets hang him up from the nearest rhubarb tree by his scrotum
2519736 what and countenance the actions of the wheel we are stix sir we desire nothing more than justice throughout our realm only logic and honest evidence shall convict you
2519737 its the forces of the wheel run run for your lives
2519738 bring all the known stix to me the rest take them to far kinell town hall incarcerate them with inconsolable misery make their 102 bindings hurt or take away their chairs that sort of thing i want them all to suffer in some form or other empty the snack bar and douse the fire in the range make it all nasty and smoky for them yes and have the toilets blocked too let them wallow in their own filth
2519739 whatta ya make me do that for ya damned fool hamster i could a done someone a serious injury to someone
2519740 didnt she mention working in some place that lived in eternal winter hey that must mean she made it home then got into some kind a bind
2519741 youre looking as lovely as ever did you manage to find out who that dormouse was who stole away our best subject
2519742 i did doctor and please cease your use of sexually charged compliments i find them most demeaning
2519743 her name is felicity bugler she is the adopted sister of joan their mother is one brenda bugler who happens to be an immigrant gerbil from sandy desert land neither has a record of psychic ability so i imagine that your theory proposing that extra sensory perception is contagious and can be caught from sharing toasted sandwiches or photocopying your private parts in public buildings can be thrown upon the pile of theoretical scientific excrement where it belongs along with most of your other theories have you contacted kool kustard by the way
2519744 no ones seen hide nor hair of her since they even called in the police but theyre as just as much a total loss as those cream brained oiks at kool kustard i hate custard by the way i have an intolerance to vanilla
2519745 i mean all about your other theories the ones that arent completely loopy
2519746 ah you mean my theory that psychic ability isnt a vestigial ability from a time when rodents were easy meat for predators and that as a consequence of the increasing amount of technology that weve added to our civilization weve lost for the most part
2519747 and that were evolving into a species capable of many mental skills that currently are considered either unusual or just 85 plain impossible in this case i was thinking of teleportation
2519748 my dear you may be the prettiest thing south of the river bile and a sure fire winner of miss hamster heath even wearing a mud pie costume
2519749 but if you seriously think that teleportation is even remotely feasible then im sorry you must have a brain as small as your pert young breasts think of something else something sensible
2519750 i think youre right it explains everything quickly break out the dimensional fracture detection kit we have an investigation to conduct
2519751 you been looked almost everywhere girl but you aint found no sister of yours im thinkin you aughta be out there lookin some more you want your porridge tomorrow you better earn it you catchin my drift
2519752 but theres no where else to look i even phone professor desmond squealch for advice i thought maybe he could invent a machine for finding joan but even he couldnt help
2519753 by golly but i reckon theres one place you aint been lookin
2519754 you aint been seen them head shrinkin fellas in town it was them what made all this troublin stuff get them to undo the stuff they do make them find your sister
2519755 mum youre a genius but not in the way you think they can find her they can find her by training me to use my brain like she used hers just because were unrelated and come from completely different species i see no reason why joan and i shouldnt have the same mental powers its just a matter of opening the door inside my mind
2519756 theyve been testing joan for extra sensory perception and other paranormal powers well mum and i have long believed that shes been a mental balloon just waiting to burst it was just a matter of time ive seen it coming and tried to delay the inevitable for as long as i could by keeping her stress levels down and getting her the custard pot leveling job with you but now i think theyve over stimulated her brain and now shes finally done it
2519757 shes popped but where are all the guts gore and high velocity blood spatter the place was as clean a whistle she hadnt even taken a clandestine tinkle in the corner
2519758 so you see that its quite possible that joan either teleported through a temporal vortex or fell through a tear in the space time continuum
2519759 so which do you prefer the first one or the second
2519760 and more importantly what do you suggest i do about it
2519761 they think that its 73 haunted by the ghost of my pet woodlouse norman
2519762 it doesnt drag chains about and shriek like the earwigs of hamster hell you know
2519763 it sits at the foot of the bed and gently nibbles at an ethereal log
2519764 but that matters not my dead pet woodlouse is of no consequence this is a roof over our head while we consider our futures this can be our temporary haven of solitude and anyone who thinks otherwise or can put up a reasonable counter argument can go fluff themselves
2519765 just as long as no one down there spots up poncing about up here in broad daylight first
2519766 i did save you from drowning the least you should do is help me make good my escape its not like im stix or anything anti governmental im a fugitive from justice and its not my fault and im missing the adventures of captain shakedick on television the last episode was a cliff hanger too
2519767 the poor girls got a family waiting for her i know im only a cavy but if you put it to the vote im up for saving the sweet things skin
2519768 but i happen to agree its dark all the idiot inhabitants of weasels pit will have taken to their beds by now lets get down to the lake and find that sewer outlet
2519769 i mean might the pike not take you or the
2519770 ill just walk around the edge of the lake then climb down to the outlet getting inside might be problematic but im a hamster im sure ill think of something

2519774 pi di ogni altra cosa ci ha contribuito a rendere particolarmente cara alla madre la sua figlia pi giovane
2519775 in piena coscienza e di libera scelta smisi di pregare
2519776 ci fu per me qualcosa di completamente nuovo nelle sinagoghe e nelle chiese protestanti che ho frequentato i credenti si recano alle funzioni qui per entr una persona nella chiesa deserta come se si recasse ad un intimo
2519777 ci sono stati degli individui che in seguito ad unimprovvisa mutazione della loro personalit hanno creduto di incontrare la misericordia divina
2519778 questo stato il mio primo incontro con la croce e con la forza divina che trasmette ai suoi portatori
2519779 ci che non era nei miei piani era nei piani di dio in me prende vita la profonda convinzione che visto dal lato di dio non esiste il caso tutta la mia vita fino ai minimi particolari gi tracciata nei piani della provvidenza divina e davanti agli occhi assolutamente veggenti di dio presenta una correlazione perfettamente compiuta
2519780 dopo ogni incontro che mi fa sentire limpossibilit di influenzare direttamente sacuisce in me limpellenza di un mio proprio olocausto
2519781 se la carriera universitaria venisse resa accessibile per le donne potrei allora caldamente raccomandarla pi di qualsiasi altra persona per lammissione allesame di abilitazione
2519782 avevo cessato di praticare la mia religione ebraica e mi sentivo nuovamente ebrea solo dopo il mio ritorno a dio
2519783 durante il periodo immediatamente prima e anche per molto tempo dopo la mia conversione
2519784 per la sua vita e per il suo lavoro ritrova sempre le necessarie forze nel convento dei benedettini di beuron dove si reca a trascorrere le maggiori festivit dellanno ecclesiastico
2519785 avevo gi sentito prima delle severe misure contro gli ebrei ma ora cominciai improvvisamente a capire che dio aveva posto ancora una volta pesantemente la sua mano sul suo popolo e che il destino di questo popolo era anche il mio destino
2519786 se qui non posso continuare in germania non ci sono pi possibilit per me
2519787 non lattivit umana ci pu aiutare ma solamente la passione di cristo
2519788 perch lhai conosciuta la fede cristiana non voglio dire nulla contro di lui sar anche stato un uomo buono ma perch s fatto dio
2519789 ogni settimana scriver poi una lettera alla madre non ricever risposte la sorella rosa le mander notizie da casa
2519790 sotto la croce capii il destino del popolo di dio che allora 1933 cominciava ad annunciarsi
2519791 fino allultimo momento mia madre rimasta fedele alla sua religione ma poich la sua fede e la sua ferma fiducia nel suo dio fu lultima cosa che rimase viva nella sua agonia ho fiducia che ha trovato un giudice molto clemente e che ora la mia pi fedele assistente in modo che anchio possa arrivare alla meta
2519792 chi entra nel carmelo non perduto per i suoi ma in effetti ancora pi vicino questo poich la nostra professione di rendere conto a dio per tutti
2519793 devo continuamente pensare alla regina ester che venne sottratta al suo popolo per renderne conto davanti al re io sono una piccola e debole ester ma il re che mi ha eletto infinitamente grande e misericordioso questa una grande consolazione
2519794 gi ora accetto con gioia in completa sottomissione e secondo la sua santissima volont la morte che iddio mi ha destinato
2519795 desidero semplicemente raccontare che cosa ho sperimentato ad essere ebrea
2519796 della giovent che oggi viene educata gi dallet pi tenera ad odiare gli ebrei
2519797 giovanni della croce il mistico dottore della chiesa in occasione del quattrocentesimo anniversario della sua nascita 1542 1942
2519798 una scientia crucis la scienza della croce pu essere appresa solo se si sente tutto il peso della croce
2519799 che gli esseri umani potessero arrivare ad essere cos non lho mai saputo e che le mie sorelle e i miei fratelli dovessero soffrire cos anche questo non lho veramente saputo

2519809 it dont half look big and imposing its like a set from a really scary motion picture
2519810 so how do we get inside without drawing too much attention to ourselves can anyone pick a lock or utter a magical incantation that actually works
2519811 quite inadvertently you have made a significant statement i should be able to see your private parts at least in silhouette
2519812 she aint got no willy gals aint allowed in abbeys its a male preserve they can be law masters and stuff but they cant be priests of the wheel we gotta dress her up as a boy
2519813 i guess street urchins in prannick are better fed than most
2519814 i didnt feel a thing and if i had i wouldnt have known what to do with it
2519815 is er avenger huge hampton i am the purveyor of the finest condoms in all rodentdom one size fits all in seventeen different shades of beige may my pages and i take up temporary residence with you for this solitary night i hear that there are bandits abroad and i fancy that my throat might be slit and my sample sheaths stolen if i remain in the forest for very much longer
2519816 es your rata over there standing in the pissing rain
2519817 my cavy is possibly the most intelligent in all cavydom might it also be allowed warmth shelter and a place to lay its cerebral head
2519818 because the abbot gags in the presence of effluence por que your rata appears to be coated in an amalgam of leaf litter mud and excremento i am afraid that under these circumstances that entry it is not allowed 44 return ma ana
2519819 only the most naturally occurring and locally produced excremento i assure you
2519820 we could always strip off the filth encrusted finery and bury it in the woods shes still nice and clean underneath
2519821 no ones going near my finery youd better believe it my finerys as much me as say my nose is or my reproductive organs id feel naked id feel violated im telling ya right now it aint gonna happen
2519822 you would still have your body armour and arrow proof codpiece
2519823 margarita hummingbird as your owner and heir to the throne of er the condom purveyors guild i order you to shed your soiled finery and join us within the walls of this edifice
2519824 my name is abbot dunnock farley dunnock before that well known for my piety and devotion to the wheel who are you
2519825 brother dos fresas please show these gentlehamsters to the guest quarters
2519826 if you can stand a little honesty which im sure you can because youre in that sort of game this cell is horrible ive slept in more comfortable ditches ive snagged my testes on barbed wire fences that were silkier than this blanket and as regards to this palliasse well it should be renamed sore ass
2519827 but you would know nothing of this you are stix sleep well breakfast is served when the sparrow crows or the wild weasel farts whichever comes first or is the loudest or best gains our attention hasta luego
2519828 im not much into social studies and stuff so please forgive my ignorance but what is the wheel spokes and sticks
2519829 in fact its the only one thats allowed actually its more than a religion its a control mechanism over the people of this benighted land it has effectively subjugated the masses to meet the needs of the powerful few the principle is that all life revolves upon a wheel at the hub is our most base instincts at the rim lays the place to which we should all aspire perfection in rodent form the monks and priests are 48 the spokes that bind them together and supposedly help us climb from the depths of the hub to the eternal righteousness of the rim the law masters are there to make sure we dont slip back down again i hate it i hate the whole hypocritical stink hole of it all even if it did stop the inter rodent wars and create rodent union that was just a lucky side effect it makes me so angry that i want to take a stick to my own genitals
2519830 why would the law master of weasels pit get her knickers in a twist over capturing a few stix doesnt she approve of self flagellation
2519831 stix are like sticks in a wheel they tend to bugger things up
2519832 hence my dunking in lake effluence if it hadnt been for my hamstery cheek pouches i would have drowned she may not have admitted it but the law master was effectively having me executed
2519833 next time i see her im gonna stomp that furry arsed momma into the ground you see if i dont
2519834 terrible eyesight fabulous hearing full of shit so it was a troubled joan bugler that finally slipped into a dream filled slumber her last coherent thought was bugger those institute people i was happier being a simple custard packer i should have stayed home and played tiddly winks with the strange uncle roger oh why did they have to discover i had a stupid talent that could lead me into danger and possibly death bugger them all to hamster hell
2519835 sunt numeroase studii care dovedesc riscurile expunerii continue la electromagnetic field radiation emf
2519836 but abbot its raining outside ill catch my death of cold
2519837 youll catch your death of something else if you dont get out there this instant
2519838 you ride to weasels pit where you will inform the law master that the fugitives she seeks are within the abbey walls and will remain so until the morning now go quickly to the critter shed and select yourself a mount
2519839 your owner he is in great peril give me a sign that you can hear me
2519840 what brings you out here on such a crap awful night sugar
2519841 in the light of what brother dos fresas has told us anywhere is preferable to here come
2519842 have you forgotten some desperately important artifact perhaps i can hide it for you until another day when freedom once more walks the land of prannick and you can return to take back that which is rightly yours
2519843 i get these funny feelings 55 every once in a while i sense danger
2519844 we are far from weasels pit and you are a mere serf how could you possibly sense danger enough of this silliness lets be about our way with the utmost alacrity
2519845 well obviously not as good as your talent of walking between worlds but yes its helped me out of bother once or twice
2519846 theres about twenty of them theyre coming this way lawmen i think armed to the incisors and ready to slit our throats
2519847 i know some really brainy hamsters in the head shrinkers department at the institute of hugely important studies whod kill to meet you
2519848 for are you not headed on the road to knackered dobbin as we speak did you suspect that i might have been staying with my cousin tobias frooty and so sought to catch me standing in the pantry with my knickers round my ankles
2519849 i can see in your eyes that you speak the truth do you have message from the abbot for me
2519850 i inverted it and quickly wrote in case of emergency piss here in felt tip pen naturally i tore out the lining and hung it upon a nearby trestle i didnt think youd want it spoiled
2519851 of course theyre all far too uncivilized to dab their willies dry upon it im certain that it will remain unsoiled and fit to once more protect the royal head fur from any amount of vicious chafing
2519852 and when you wash out my helmet i insist that you use only the most daintily fragranced soap from spanx i have some in my carpet bag
2519853 tis i brother algy tumbler pray let us in i have the law master of weasels pit with me she wishes to speak with the abbot
2519854 no es possible bandits are in the forest you look like bandits to me you must leave instantaneously
2519855 i have seen better examples at the thrudsday farmers market in winkers bottom now go away
2519856 let the law master in and take her to our guests immediately
2519857 gone gone where find them find them now find them or you take their places
2519858 im going to regain my composure by praying to the wheel make sure that the law master leaves in a contented mood i dont want to be disturbed
2519859 r pidamente you must escape now i have sent the law master down to the lower latrines there was a hideous blowback this afternoon when she has managed to haul herself from the filth and disgustingness happiness will elude her we go now
2519860 how can we escape by gaining the upper floor are we expected to leap from the roof onto nearby rhubarb fronds from whence we can slide to safety if so i should warn you that my depth perception is a little wanting ill probably miss and fall to an agonizing death
2519861 youre going down the rear fire escape from there you can disappear into the forest
2519862 we cant go barging in hell call the law master and even if he doesnt hes bound to notice brother alfonso his career as a monk could lay in ruins
2519863 it was this party trick that got me noticed by the head shrinkers department of the institute for hugely important studies
2519864 i can see into rooms without the aid of a window key hole handy cardboard periscope or any artificial means all i have to do is imagine a light source within the room then if theres anyone inside i can see their bodies interrupt the imaginary beam of light if the beam remains uninterrupted then hooray the room is empty
2519865 assuming that accuracy is taken 63 for granted does it have a useful application in the real world
2519866 now were well and truly fluffed we cant go forward and we cant go back
2519867 no intiendo from where did the other body come the monks are all nicely tucked up in bed there can be no one else
2519868 the abbot said that he was going to pray do the figures kneel can you see that precisely
2519869 well i reckon one of them is kneeling i guess thatd mean someone is praying one seems to be standing over the other maybe administering some quaint religious sacrament i cant be certain im not a certain kind of person
2519870 mother superior did you lose your way in the dark on the way to the nunnery and were your clothes torn from your body by so many wild brambles that they were left in tatters and had to be abandoned in the forest
2519871 but i can draw blood with greater skill than the butchest hamster in all prannick and probably other places too
2519872 you must save him of course have you tried the critter shed
2519873 do clearly i cannot remain here i am implicated with a group
2519874 i had no idea that monks had such vivid imaginations
2519875 who says i had to imagine anything you really do not know me at all
2519876 sorry about all the kafuffle and shoulder cuffing of earlier let me introduce myself then perhaps you would care to do the same but please dont interrupt me until i direct you to speak im very important it comes naturally my name is darkwood dunce i am heir to the throne of spanx
2519877 not that its any surprise i dont get out a lot
2519878 excuse me for interrupting but you have a most unusual name your dad does too how come
2519879 i might take you up on your kind offer of course i didnt know i could walk between worlds they must have inadvertently opened a door inside my brain when i visited the institute of hugely important studies for a series of psychic tests im certainly feeling cleverer and cleverer with every passing second perhaps in time i might achieve the level of genius or perhaps its nothing more than the lovely clean air you have here i dont know but thats by the by what do we do next
2519880 youre local answer me this to which location do you suggest we transport ourselves next food shelter and a safe refuge from an inevitable pursuit by the lawmen of weasels pit would be a prerequisite
2519881 i can hear horns being blown in the village below
2519882 mount up we ride into destiny for the justice of the wheel
2519883 i said id carry you wherever you wanted to go and carry you i will
2519884 i thought you wanted me to take you to the abbey
2519885 where else would i go i cant go home i dont know the way
2519886 imagine vessels that fly higher than the mountains of belch and farther than the edge of the world
2519887 theyre called dirigibles and theyre full of inflammable gas they say that theyre safer that three wheeled go karts but im not so sure i think that three wheels must be safer than a huge bag of inflammable gas but then what would i know i just level frozen custard for a living
2519888 to marmota espa a we had a fortnight in bunnidorm
2519889 this is not the first time that i have heard of such things
2519890 a strange hamster came to my fathers castle a few seasons past he too spoke of the modern world 37 we thought that he was a fantasist but it turned up that he wasnt a fantasist at all he was a complete bastard the cur stole a vast fortune in dull grey metal the evil little shit and my poor father was forced to sell his lavatory bowl painting kit in order to replenish the royal coffers so traumatic was it that i was told were i to meet the scoundrel upon my travels that i should administer a mailed fist to the fellows crown jewels
2519891 so lets just carry on to the abbey and forget everything i said shall we
2519892 anyway as i was saying to the miniscule rootley farnham and it
2519893 the dunk master can shove his dunking chair right up his arse i mean think about it its not even logical surely dunking my puny body into the stinky waters of lake effluence with its multitude of diseases shit and hamster eating pike cannot possibly prove that i am anything but an average hamster who firmly believes in the teachings of the wheel its so obvious that even a blithering moron could see it and anyone who thinks it isnt and can mount a reasonable counter argument can go stick their privates in the mangle sideways
2519894 and eloquent too but it will do you no good boy for if the fishy wishies dont eat you and your lungs do not give up their air too freely it will only condemn you then youll hang from the gallows for a week where the midges can feast gleefully upon your soft tissues
2519895 its not like youre all surprised or anything everyone knows that weasels pit has a well trained toad as its dunk master and an ugly bastard one at that
2519896 into the dunking chair accused scum quickly or ill wrap my enormous tongue about your nether regions and crush you to a pulp
2519897 do your worst loathsome beast youll not better me i curse the wheel
2519898 young farnham is a witch after all es gone and made imself all eavy sos e can sink to the bottom and evade the justice of the wheel by wallowin in the ooze
2519899 the word is warlock and would you please refrain from dropping your aitches but i take your point drowning is an excellent means to save yourself from the gallows but itll do him no good whatsoever justice will prevail ill see to that
2519900 he might ave turned imself into a pike sos e can swim away and thumb is nose at us at a later date and probably from quite some distance too
2519901 i do believe we are witnessing a primitive form of law enforcement for surely it is not justice that we see practiced here
2519902 but should we sit and fret why aint ya doing something about it
2519903 do you really think so it would be ever so daring wouldnt it but might we not risk some dreadful wounding from the lawmens crossbows
2519904 but underneath all this flappy finery theres a chain mail blanket even this female equivalent of a codpiece that im wearing is armoured aint nothing gonna hurt me 24 unless i take a bolt straight up the jacksey and what are the chances of that
2519905 i had that codpiece especially made for you i call it a minge piece it fits perfectly
2519906 yes and i shall wear the armour of righteousness to protect me come dear gallant margarita the bravest female cavy in all of spanx we gallop toward our destiny
2519907 we waddle with all this crap on my back the only way im gonna build up any speed is by jumping off a cliff i dont see one any place nearby so we waddle toward our destiny
2519908 what you doin with young rootley farnham do you intend to ave your wicked way with im in one of the back room of the stoat and wanger im not bein conscious too its unforgivable you scarlet 27 hussy you now put im down this instant

2519979 door deze rust is een groot stuk innerlijke rust in mijn gevoel en geest wedergekeerd wil dit vasthouden lieve beer
2519980 laten we dit nog lang vasthouden en koesteren lieve beer door de eerlijkheid oprechtheid en vertrouwen in elkaar naar elkaar te houden als deze grote stevige rots die waar wij nu op zitten
2519981 ik ga even terug naar waar jij terug gaat lieve vlinder
2519982 voor jou heb ik alle tijd luister graag naar je
2519983 juist lieve beer dit weet geen n wezentje op deze aardbol
2519984 maar waarom ben je dan eigenlijk weer naar deze plek terug gekomen
2519985 lieve beer dan mag jij mij ook eens vertellen waarom jij terug bent gegaan naar deze plek
2519986 ja lieve beer ook ik had dit moment en gevoel morgen vertel ik je meer maar ik ben nu een beetje moe van mijn vlucht hierheen
2519987 nu wil ik dat jullie deze pot zien als jullie eigen leven deze pot gevuld met golfballetjes kralen zand en koffie stelt namelijk het leven van een mens voor
2519988 de golfballetjes zijn de belangrijke dingen in het leven je familie je kinderen je geloof je gezondheid en je favoriete bezigheden dingen die ervoor zorgen dat als er niets meer op de wereld was dan deze dingen je leven toch gevuld zou zijn
2519989 de kralen zijn de andere dingen die belangrijk zijn je werk je huis je auto het zand dat staat voor de kleine dingetjes die belangrijk voor je zijn
2519990 als je het zand als eerste in de pot kiept en hem hiermee vult is er geen plek meer voor de kralen of voor de golfballetjes datzelfde geldt ook voor je eigen leven als je al je tijd en energie aan de kleine dingetjes besteedt dan kun je nooit meer ruimte hebben voor de dingen die belangrijk voor je zijn besteed aandacht aan de dingen die belangrijk voor je zijn speel bijvoorbeeld met je kinderen neem tijd voor een onderzoek voor je gezondheid zo nu en dan neem je partner mee uit eten doe nog iets leuks er is altijd nog wel ergens tijd om het huis te poetsen of de prullenbak te repareren
2519991 zorg eerst voor de golfballetjes de dingen die echt het allerbelangrijkste voor je zijn stel je prioriteiten de rest is maar zand
2519992 ik wilde daarmee alleen nog maar weer eens aangeven en
2519993 u gulp staat open u mag niet wildplassen kunt u ook een boete voor krijgen
2519994 hey je worst is koud en hard geef me liever een warme
2519995 dont let your hearts be troubled trust in god and trust also in me there is more than enough room in my fathers home if this were not so would i have told you that i am going to prepare a place for you when everything is ready i will come and get you so that you will always be with me where i am and you know the way to where i am going
2519996 so he took me in the spirit to a great high mountain and he showed me the holy city jerusalem descending out of heaven from god it shone with the glory of god and sparkled like a precious stone like jasper as clear as crystal the city wall was broad and high with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels and the names of the twelve tribes of israel were written on the gates there were three gates on each side east north south and west the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
2519997 no longer will there be a curse upon anything for the throne of god and of the lamb will be there and his servants will worship him and they will see his face and his name will be written on their foreheads and there will be no night there no need for lamps or sun for the lord god will shine on them and they will reign forever and ever
2519998 the spirit and the bride say come let anyone who hears this say come let anyone who is thirsty come let anyone who desires drink freely from the water of life
2519999 the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field in his excitement he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field
