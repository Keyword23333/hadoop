900000 these figures do not surprise me on the whole employees are not sending stuff out maliciously but through carelessness or lack of fore thought education can help to some extent but many employees are using communications tools all day every day and mistakes will happen so having checks in place makes sense affordability of available technology to tackle the problem is also a problem as most businesses are unable to invest in the high end on premise data leak prevention dlp products that large business can so the availability of on demand services like those offered by mimecast to achieve the same end is welcome providing performance is not adversely affected
900001 there was never a compelling offer put on the table
900002 i think you have overpaid in terms of executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome on the board
900003 its been about 26 hours in the course of a 24 hour day
900004 my support and my wifes support is with this board and this management team
900005 it looks like a gpu and acts like a gpu but actually what its doing is introducing a large number of x86 cores into your pc
900006 maybe that will influence some potential buyers to wait certainly that would be intels ambition however do you think ati and nvidia are just going to sit on their hands until 2010 and wait for larrabee to show up
900007 i love you amber christine hudgins and i want you to have my baby
900008 weve only got a couple of pairs of clothing each and i grabbed our photos and a few papers and that was it
900009 what if i look like a complete idiot with what im wearing
900010 along came a black citizen of kenya africa origins a muslim who studied in an islamic school in indonesia his name is obama
900011 obama said he would turn jerusaleminto the eternal capitol of israelis this indicates our brother obama is ignorant of international politics and is not familiar with the middle east conflict
900012 were not going to have the engineers and the scientists to continue space exploration if we dont have kids who are able to read write and compute
900013 its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program i mentioned this earlier i want to tell you that you know i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us
900014 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem i want to make sure that we are putting together a comprehensive plan that is going to work and if we have a package that is offshore drilling only which is what bush and mccain have been emphasizing and that wont solve the problem and i would be opposed to that
900015 we are able to create high quality pieces at a lower price point and make them more accessible to a larger number of people my line has also become more sophisticated and so it was fun to be able to bring in more of the c ronson elements
900016 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
900017 england need someone they can respect and who can take them forward over a period of time
900018 there are precedents for the best player being the captain allan border did it for australia and viv richards for west indies they were both successful so why not
900019 kp would relish the chance to be england captain and as good a player as he already is now the extra responsibility might just send him on to a higher plane
900020 he is an exciting cricketer who has a decent cricket brain to go with his talents with the bat and although he will be different to michael there is every chance that he could be a success
900021 in an ideal world i think one captain is the best for the team one voice doing all forms of the game
900022 that was when i was at my best because youre with the players all the time and you can really form a great bond
900023 in an ideal world weve always said that you should have one captain and im sure theyll make the decision who will captain from now on
900024 it is caught between a rock and a hard place the fed will stand pat

900027 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
900028 static caused by urgent sometimes vexing or even contradictory information played at too high a volume for too long
900029 some obama backers are right to worry that the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
900030 its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
900031 what we have learnt this week is that when the republican attack machine cranks up as hillary clinton predicted obama is actually pretty vulnerable
900032 obama will put his face on the 100 bill mccain w video
900033 ma guarda lo stesso locale le stesse patate lo stesso brachetto

900038 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
900039 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
900040 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
900041 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
900042 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
900043 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
900044 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
900045 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
900046 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
900047 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
900048 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
900049 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
900050 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
900051 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
900052 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
900053 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
900054 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
900055 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
900056 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
900057 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
900058 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
900059 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
900060 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
900061 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
900062 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
900063 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
900064 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
900065 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
900066 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
900067 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
900068 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
900069 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
900070 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
900071 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
900072 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
900073 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
900074 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
900075 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
900076 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
900077 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
900078 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
900079 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
900080 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
900081 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
900082 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
900083 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
900084 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
900085 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
900086 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
900087 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
900088 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
900089 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
900090 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
900091 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
900092 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
900093 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
900094 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
900095 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
900096 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
900097 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
900098 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
900099 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
900100 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
900101 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
900102 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
900103 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
900104 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
900105 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
900106 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
900107 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
900108 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
900109 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
900110 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
900111 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
900112 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
900113 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
900114 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
900115 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
900116 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
900117 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
900118 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
900119 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
900120 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
900121 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
900122 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
900123 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
900124 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
900125 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
900126 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
900127 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
900128 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
900129 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
900130 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
900131 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
900132 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
900133 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
900134 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
900135 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
900136 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
900137 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
900138 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
900139 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
900140 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
900141 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
900142 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
900143 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
900144 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
900145 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
900146 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
900147 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
900148 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
900149 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
900150 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
900151 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
900152 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
900153 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
900154 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
900155 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
900156 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
900157 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
900158 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
900159 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
900160 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
900161 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
900162 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
900163 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
900164 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
900165 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
900166 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
900167 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
900168 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
900169 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
900170 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
900171 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
900172 n n on regarde avec les yeux pas avec les mains
900173 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
900174 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
900175 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
900176 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
900177 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
900178 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
900179 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
900180 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
900181 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
900182 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
900183 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
900184 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
900185 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
900186 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
900187 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
900188 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
900189 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
900190 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
900191 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
900192 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
900193 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
900194 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
900195 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
900196 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
900197 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
900198 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
900199 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
900200 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees

900220 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
900221 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce
900222 if you lie with dogs you are going to get fleas
900223 he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again
900224 bill ayres thought he and barry were friends and the wives were friendly too but they werent prepared for that big ol bus that runs right over you
900225 if we go into iran with the idea of reducing the co2 output of its leaders maybe the could get the dhimms to be on our side probably not
900226 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
900227 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
900228 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
900229 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
900230 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
900231 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
900232 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program

900234 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
900235 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
900236 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
900237 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
900238 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
900239 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
900240 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
900241 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
900242 i heard people say that they didnt have a right to vote from abroad
900243 a vote is a vote regardless of where you are for anyone who says they dont have a right to vote you do
900244 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
900245 i do think theres an opportunity for us to shine a light on some of those questions
900246 i think youll see that we will answer the call
900247 when theres news we will deal with the issues as they come
900248 we arent going to go there as the guests of the chinese government and deliberately poke sharp sticks in their eyes
900249 were not going to go out of our way to do it but we think there are going to be a lot of opportunities to bring the subject up based on the events of the day
900250 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
900251 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
900252 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
900253 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
900254 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
900255 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply

900263 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
900264 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
900265 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
900266 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
900267 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
900268 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
900269 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
900270 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
900271 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
900272 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
900273 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
900274 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
900275 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
900276 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
900277 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
900278 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
900279 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
900280 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
900281 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
900282 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
900283 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
900284 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
900285 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
900286 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
900287 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
900288 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
900289 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
900290 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
900291 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
900292 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
900293 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
900294 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
900295 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
900296 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
900297 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
900298 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
900299 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
900300 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
900301 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
900302 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
900303 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
900304 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
900305 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
900306 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
900307 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
900308 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
900309 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
900310 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
900311 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
900312 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
900313 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
900314 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
900315 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
900316 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
900317 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
900318 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
900319 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
900320 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
900321 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
900322 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
900323 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
900324 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
900325 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
900326 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
900327 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
900328 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
900329 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
900330 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
900331 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
900332 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
900333 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
900334 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
900335 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
900336 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
900337 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
900338 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
900339 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
900340 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
900341 so programs cannot rely on the hash function being called for every lookup or update

900356 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
900357 decisions taken today do not inhibit indias future ability to develop and pursue nuclear technologies for the benefit of the nation
900358 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
900359 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
900360 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
900361 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
900362 you know its not about you its about your country
900363 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
900364 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years

900366 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
900367 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
900368 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
900369 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
900370 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
900371 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
900372 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
900373 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
900374 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
900375 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

900409 there is no question but that the ussr looks upon the eventual absorption of germany in particular into the soviet orbit as a major objective there are already signs that the ussr is reversing its hard economic policy on stripping the east zone and is encouraging the revival of german nationalism with the idea that a revived germany allied with the soviet would be almost unbeatable of course the kremlin is well aware that a new germany could turn on the east as well as the west but hopes to avoid this through strict communist party control
900410 therefore we urge that the western powers adopt the joint policy of encouraging german economic revival accelerating the development of democratic institutions and actively combating soviet subversion

900432 weve been focused on pre season trying to bring players in my situation is not the priority
900433 i couldnt agree with chairman niall quinn more its not important
900434 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on his case
900435 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players it is better i dont speak about names i said that yesterday it is better i leave things to your imagination and creation
900436 people kept asking me about the appearance record when i was trying to win the premier league and champions league so it is a relief not to have it there any more
900437 of course i am proud to have done it but now i just want to move on hopefully add a few more games to the total and focus on the team
900438 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
900439 now you see players with nice cars and 18 year olds on good money
900440 but its down to the individual having the right attitude and application its not enough just to have the talent
900441 i have seen players with plenty of ability no shortage of that whatsoever but they didnt make it because they did not have enough hunger to sacrifice things in order to succeed
900442 i leave the real partying to the young lads they can handle it better
900443 i am sure paul will do well because he knows his stuff
900444 he has done things a different way to my other team mates he started right at the bottom and did brilliantly at macclesfield and mk dons
900445 some people would say that is the proper way of doing things he has proven himself now he just has to do it in the premier league
900446 he will get a lot of respect because he has done it all as a player
900447 but that only gets you so far because you have got to know your stuff
900448 if he has the same enthusiasm he had during his playing days i am sure he will do really well
900449 the final third is a little bit of a problem we have only threatened from long range free kicks and follow ups
900450 we lacked punch we had that problem in the first 10 or 12 games last season you address it by working on drills in training and building confidence
900451 but we are getting the six or seven new players drilled into what playing for this club is all about
900452 i saw fulham at birmingham and they are blending together a team
900453 they are probably in their pre season a little bit ahead of us they look to have a bit more of a cutting edge
900454 im still in the hunt for a couple of players if we get them in before the start all well and good but im pretty much happy to start with what we have got
900455 we have pitched in our new players and its coming together slowly but surely
900456 i dont know but at the moment i think about what i have
900457 we must give confidence to the players if we talk about new players they might lose some
900458 i will give confidence to these players and if we find a good striker they can help us to have more quality and then we have competition
900459 we had discipline and from the discipline we scored sometimes you lose discipline and you have to talk to young players
900460 but if you have new players you cant be sure he has discipline
900461 didier will not play in our first game against portsmouth and will probably miss the second against wigan if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that
900462 but when you have a knee injury you just never know
900463 i have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day
900464 hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
900465 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
900466 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games
900467 he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic and anelka today and in the last game played more inside the penalty area than before
900468 that is where i asked him to play and where i need him not right and left as before because we have one striker and that is anelka
900469 by the way the analysis you reference is mostly from shareholder com interesting company
900470 get over this brough ha ha and resume civil conduct
900471 no i am sorry but you lost the privilege of seeing my son when you tried to throw him out of your house when you said he was no longer welcome except accompanied by me for public events
900472 this is a serious email about him he deserves to know how horrible you are being i will sue you
900473 we acknowledge the step towards more transparency in the negotiations conducted by the commission
900474 however once again the needless pressure to complete the process within an unrealistic timescale made a sound stakeholder involvement impossible and has resulted in inconsistencies and impractical requirements that will haunt the sector into the future we regret that we will have to start out with a set of rules that contains serious flaws already from the beginning the very short time frame left for having the rules in place in the member states before january 2009 is of major concern for the sector
900475 we find it a step backwards that the limits for manure input and stocking densities are less fixed now with unclear consequences for the implementation on member state level says sabine eigenschink the ifoam eu groups regulation expert
900476 the simplest and most popular approach would be for the council to remove the mandatory obligation
900477 they decide to use ipc as a vehicle to make money online you should have your specific written goals outlined and a detailed daily action plan to reach them also it is very important to reward yourself once you reach your goals and keep striving for higher acheivements

900514 siento la confianza y respaldo que me tiene el t cnico
900515 vi a algunos de mis compa eros no al cien por ciento y es entendible de que ten an el partido de tecos y el viaje pero creo que rindieron aunque no al m ximo
900516 siento la confianza y respaldo que me tiene el t cnico efra n en ese momento y en lo personal yo trato de responderle porque siempre hay que agradecer a quien te da la oportunidad y esta noche entr con todas los nimos de hacer lo mejor posible en la cancha
900517 creo que se ganan muchas cosas sobre todo para los que tenemos poca experiencia entre comillas nos deja la experiencia en no hacer los errores que se cometieron esta noche y tambi n nos ayudar el habernos enfrentado a este gran rival porque por momentos chivas hizo ver mal al barcelona
900518 pues al final es una derrota el resultado no lo dejamos de lado perdimos y de una manera que a nadie le gusta porque ellos fueron muy superiores
900519 es dif cil hacer ahorita un an lisis ellos fueron mucho mejores nos vamos con la derrota
900520 aqu lo que cuenta son los goles y al final nos metieron cinco por lo que nos vamos tristes
900521 en lo personal no me gusta poner excusas realmente nos ganaron porque fueron mejores y fueron contundentes
900522 me sent un poco cansado por el partido del viernes
900523 pienso que en este grupo hay mucha capacidad y en momentos lo demostramos l gicamente que ellos son de primer nivel de primer mundo y son muy acertados nosotros tuvimos por ah unas oportunidades que no aprovechamos al final de cuentas hubo lapsos en los que nos pusimos de t a t
900524 el estilo de juego de ellos es muy bueno tienen una gran capacidad una gran idea futbol stica creo que tambi n de esto se aprende de la rapidez del bal n el ritmo que impusieron en el juego de eso se aprende el buen conjunto que son ellos
900525 hubiera sido diferente nosotros venimos de un partido el viernes que fue muy intenso conocemos muy poco al equipo barcelona puesto que est n en su pretemporada creo que si hubi ramos preparado el partido hubiera sido una cosa distinta
900526 l gicamente me sent un poco cansado por el partido del viernes pero nosotros somos profesionales e intentamos hacer todo lo que est en nuestras manos
900527 los goles son goles valen y hay que sumar m s
900528 estoy contento de meterle a un gol a un gran equipo lo que es barcelona y hay que seguir trabajando uno trabaja para estar bien para el partido y mi trabajo es meter goles soy delantero y hoy me toca hacer gol pero hay que seguir trabajando
900529 fue un bal n que el defensa dud la dividi y yo sab a que era de primera con decisi n iba corriendo y dije hay que pegar y entr
900530 los goles son goles y valen y hay que sumar m s hay que disfrutarlo casi nunca se juega contra barcelona y hay que aprender de los bueno y lo malo hay que sumar creo que falt un poco y fueron errores que sabemos que no podemos perder la pelota pero ante barcelona que es un gran equipo sabemos que la van a meter
900531 me da gusto en lo personal anotar un gol en la pretemporada ven a anotando y quer a seguir haci ndolo nos sabe un poquito mal porque perdimos pero a final de cuentas fue contra barcelona tenemos mucho que aprender y que bueno que nos pas esto para seguir mejorando en todos los aspectos
900532 por el apoyo de toda la gente contra el bar a es un equipo de primer nivel y poder hacer un gol es lo m s bonito en el futbol le doy muchas gracias a dios seguir trabajando con todo como lo he venido haciendo con mucha humildad y seguir trabajando igual por si se da la oportunidad
900533 como quisi ramos ven amos de un partido hace 48 horas dif cil pero no hay que poner peros jugamos contra uno de los mejores equipos del mundo queremos llegar a eso y hay que descansar para ver qu nos hace falta
900534 ac todos estamos esperando una oportunidad y jugamos al futbol por el gusto de hacerlo y agradezco al profesor efra n flores que nos dio esta oportunidad
900535 sencillamente el ritmo con el que se jug es un ritmo al que le gusta a chivas es en el que est acostumbrado a jugar y enfrentar a estos adversarios nos va a ayudar pues la fuerza la velocidad y la potencia con la que se jug este partido es la que tenemos que aplicar en m xico y sacarle provecho
900536 los j venes sabr n que debemos que tener una lectura de juego que hay veces que hay que jugar al futbol y otras en las que tenemos que terminar las jugadas mi equipo quiso salir tan exquisito como siempre y eso contra un equipo que te aprieta bien perdimos dos balones muy f ciles y ante barcelona ese equipo no te perdona
900537 los j venes metieron los goles y creamos otras opciones los goles caen por errores de los juveniles y as pasa pero sin embargo vi gente con mucha personalidad vi a un marco fabi n enfrentando con mucha personalidad a los jugadores de barcelona los j venes de chivas tienen mucha personalidad y la autoridad con la que juegan nos dice que vamos a tener un equipo competitivo
900538 el tepa sol s es un muchacho que hace recorridos muy largos en el futbol mexicano viene de un esfuerzo muy grande el pasado viernes y no le alcanzaba la idea de meter a pato que lo quer amos meter antes porque si entra patricio antes del gol lo hubi ramos evitado lo habl eso con mi cuerpo t cnico era tres minutos antes el cambio y hubi ramos podido solventar un poquito m s la situaci n y estar m s equilibrados
900539 son j venes que tienen todav a mucho que aprender pero en general creo que es un equipo que est sobresaliendo poco a poco
900540 en general hicieron un buen partido estaban un poco cansados creo pero considero que es un equipo que tiene mucho futuro
900541 no solamente jonny magall n otros m s hay que esperar para que les brinden esa oportunidad
900542 le deseo lo mejor sto es de ciclos a l se le acab su ciclo de estar en el barcelona y est buscando otras metas
900543 los que estemos ah vamos a tratar de hacer lo mejor por el bien de m xico
900544 tengo una alegr a inmensa hasta ahoga un poquito la tristeza de haber errado el penal y no darle el triunfo a mi equipo y ojal pueda responder al llamado
900545 me dijo que le echara ganas que ellos conf an en m yo voy a tratar de hacer las cosas bien por m y por m xico
900546 m xico me hizo crecer como persona como futbolista todo lo que tengo hoy me lo dio m xico tengo un hijo mexicano y otro en camino yo le debo muchas cosas a m xico y ojal pueda retribuir un poquito haciendo las cosas bien con mucha garra y con mucha dedicaci n
900547 esto llega por la lesi n de un compa ero de trabajo pero uno de momento no piensa en eso lo disfruta de la misma manera y lo nico que queda es desearle una pronta recuperaci n a omar y que est bien para que nuevamente tenga la oportunidad
900548 voy a tratar de ganarme un lugar con mucha humildad y sin faltarle el respeto a nadie los que estemos ah vamos a tratar de hacer lo mejor por el bien de m xico cada quien va a poner su granito de arena no s lo yo que soy naturalizado sino tambi n los mismos nacidos en m xico van a aportar para que m xico est lo m s pronto posible en el mundial

900550 it is better to be tried by twelve than carried by six
900551 a good rule of thumb is if you are trying to kill someone never assume the wound is lethal unless you have hit their brain if you are trying not to kill someone but instead to incapacitate never assume that a wound is nonlethal until the person is in the care of a medical professional even a wound to a limb can prove fatal from blood loss or infection you should definitely practice with your gun and this can take the form of joining a local militia hunting or just practicing at a target range generally speaking if you are not an experienced shooter aim for the upper chest area as it is a large target with vital organs in it this goes double for shooting in self defense as a shot to the chest is the easiest way to stop an attacker

901290 garment workers in bangladesh are going hungry while their local bosses flaunt their wealth and the big fashion brands sourcing in the country flourish
901291 workers are skipping their own meals so that their children can eat
901292 inflation in bangladesh has rocketed with some items of food doubling in the last six months recent reports indicate that basic wage workers in bangladesh are now spending 70 of their wages on rice alone even wealthy middle managers told me they are finding it difficult to survive
901293 the us 25 legal minimum wage was set two years ago and twelve years after the previous increase in 2006 it constituted only half of what a family needed to exist it is under a third of the living wage figure for bangladesh
901294 a total ban on trade union activity for the past eighteen months has rendered bangladeshs workers voiceless and is driving the country further into poverty
901295 it is a sobering thought that it would take a bangladeshi worker earning the minimum wage 85 000 years to earn the us 15 million annual wage packet of the ceo of one leading global sporting goods brand sourcing heavily in bangladesh

901320 there were quite a few people in line at guest services when we left
901321 there was a huge line of people back to carnation and i joked to my son that that was the line to get out when we saw that the line was to city hall all we could think was you got to be kidding what do people expect disney to do well we found out cast members were going up and down the line and handing out passes good any time for the next two years to those that didnt want a refund trying to get them out of the line it was quite a spectacle the line at dca for guest services ran all the way across the entry to the locker entrance

901410 capa consulting and tourism futures international tfi have been appointed as the consultants to look at the viability of air services for the region

901412 capa and tfi will join together to assess whether the region is capable of supporting regular passenger air services and what this means for infrastructure and route development

901426 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
901427 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron james it could be d wade dwyane wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
901428 its great to be so far from staples center in los angeles and still have so much support i feel like im home
901429 thats not going to change regardless of anything barring injury am i happy with that no i want to be a starter ive always said i dont want to be a backup in the nfl
901430 he continues to complete balls and continues to have a high completion percentage
901431 id say right now hes ahead of tui hes making more plays and throwing the ball better downfield
901432 were practicing getting another look get a different jersey in here
901433 stuff might happen but you dont want to hurt their guys
901434 were just trying to get as much work as possible and learn from each other
901435 we have no idea what theyre trying to do so we have to go out there and try to be sound technically
901436 its always great to go against guys that youre clueless about whats going on
901437 from what we see he should be pitching another 10 years
901438 he really shuts us down we try to figure him out but he throws his glove out there and we have a tough time
901439 theyve got some good young pitching theyve got guys who can frickin fire it with the best of them
901440 i grew up watching the guy pitch and hes probably the best pitcher of my era
901441 to get a chance to throw against the guy ill look back on it as something i enjoyed i didnt expect to give up an rbi single to him though
901442 he makes batters do what he wants them to do luckily hes not throwing in the 90s anymore
901443 more than his throws i was pleased with how brennan was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling
901444 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good
901445 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
901446 my parents say it doesnt look like im affected on the field
901447 i say you taught me that show no weakness i played football i know how to pick and choose my battles when im hurt sometimes i grimace but i try not to show it
901448 thats something thats coming just wait i can see that happening just a matter of time
901449 i can see myself being that type of person one day thats the key to the game driving guys in being a run producer we need someone like that on our team
901450 arizona defied the odds last year they play the game right and they play the game hard but when you acquire arguably the best hitter in baseball thats a huge acquisition
901451 im really excited to be here and to have a chance to come back
901452 if im a little bit behind i have to make up that time and the only way to make up that time is full video game style you just start bouncing off stuff
901453 i kind of went for the brake and went a little bit wide and hit the wall there and bent the right rear corner of the car

901456 the viewer in our demographic can connect with park skating way more than they will connect with vert
901457 id like to see some bigger gnarlier sections on there not so compact
901458 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming
901459 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
901460 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
901461 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion ninety nine percent of the time it works out for us
901462 if it keeps raining we win it didnt and we got seventh
901463 obviously theyve brought in some new players and i think their confidence is up and ours is down slightly
901464 i feel like were getting to be more like the team we want to be
901465 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
901466 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
901467 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
901468 i know he likes to get ahead in the count i was looking for a fastball in the middle of the plate and he hung a cutter
901469 im going to swing more aggressively because lately id been tentative
901470 the doctor said everything looks good so thats the only thing it can be
901471 i feel like ive had some good at bats and some success since ive been here
901472 hes a top horse it was little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there
901473 it was very hard for me but this is a business i had to make a business decision
901474 you only have two people youre dealing with the elements theres a lot more strategy and planning in beach volleyball and i love to be outside i love the ocean
901475 its physical is why i made the decision to move
901476 its a game of inches now requiring a lot bigger taller players
901477 guess what i can do almost everything but one thing i cant do is be taller
901478 it was a lot windier and hillier than i expected and i was hoping for a better time
901479 until 2 1 2 weeks ago i wasnt even planning on running so i am certainly not complaining
901480 my mom recently had a heart attack and they were keeping her current with constant text messages
901481 dont get me wrong it has become a serious race
901482 once you break the 15 000 mark of participants it becomes a destination race
901483 hes run in new york and chicago marathons and our little vacation to san francisco for his 50th was a perfect opportunity for him to get out there
901484 its a great time to visit the city and see the boys
901485 not that guys back off in regular practice but you know what youre going to get
901486 a game isnt that way when you go into a game you feel guys out theres the unexpected
901487 practicing against other guys forces you to focus a lot more
901488 but im with a new team right now i dont really care what theyre doing
901489 hes going to be very successful in this league his style will take him a long way
901490 that depends on his relationship with the people on top
901491 last year although we werent as successful as we wanted to be it was the most fun ive had playing in my career
901492 you get used to seeing the same looks every day from our defense
901493 this will be more realistic a good gauge of where were at it will be fun
901494 but we knew if we played our ball we could shut him down but hes a great running back you cant take that away from him
901495 all their running plays were to my side the defensive left side
901496 guys that big are usually just power runners he has power and speed
901497 hes a guy whos versatile and always making big plays
901498 hes one of the best backs i faced in the sec im looking forward to practicing against him and playing against him in the preseason game

901581 banning us was the greatest thing that could ever have happened we were sending her roses every day to say thank you and she couldnt figure out why well we sold out a major london venue because of that
901582 britney is doing the utmost to stay out of the limelight and lay low and just focus on her work she is determined to be taken seriously by the courts she wants regular drug and alcohol tests to prove she is a reformed mum she thinks that by ditching the pink wigs and bad boyfriends it will help her case
901583 she has a chance kevin could end up co parenting the kids together with britney
901584 but the show isnt about just seeing if i could find someone to work for me its about people chasing their dreams i dont say it in a cocky way but i take pride in being one of the best at doing what i do
901585 its all part of my strategic plan to take over tv diddy tv
901586 most of its due to a benefactor in new york city a tai chi master named don ahn about 20 years ago i saw footage of people doing that stuff in the park
901587 he tried to get us into a derelict house he touched me it was nothing horrific but it could have been it was the start of a sexual assault there were three of us plus a little one and youd think thered have been safety in numbers but we were so frightened of him we would have done anything
901588 i only told my mum about it when i was 35 writing about the incident made me feel sick as an adult you look back at all the details you didnt understand then now i know what he wanted its frightening
901589 maybe in the year 2020 you could just pop a baby out and itd be fine but right now id rather just adopt

901596 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
901597 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
901598 the officers didnt treat her differently than anyone else kelly became really tearful and seemed incredibly embarrassed she was apologising over and over again
901599 shes got a look that a lot of younger girls liked and copied but she has no talent
901600 shes a very sweet nice girl but thats it then you put a full stop its over
901601 i think that the younger generation thinks all they have to do is get on tv and act a bit crazy and things will happen for them
901602 theyve got it wrong because you need to have a talent to get really famous
901603 i spoke to shia in the hospital his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story

901606 ive done some things to excess but i hate pot and ive never done acid or ecstasy
901607 but if i was in the right frame of mind in a pleasant creative chilled out space with just the right amount delivered by an amsterdam technician that would be incredible
901608 you know the very first time you had a warm chocolate fudge brownie with ice cream sprinkles whipped cream that is what it was like kissing steve carell

901627 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too

901636 what this power is i cannot say all i know is that it exists and it becomes available only when a man is in that state of mind in which he knows exactly what he wants and is fully determined not to quit until he finds it

901638 you are behaving like hooligans for fuck sakes we have neighbors to contend with it is 3am
901639 ive started to play more consistently in the bigger tournaments
901640 and winning my first masters event makes a big difference to my confidence
901641 i have never been past the quarter finals of a slam before so there is still a long way to go but it is up to me to continue to work hard and produce it on court it is just a matter of putting it all together for two weeks
901642 nothing is so common as the wish to be remarkable
901643 the irrationality of a thing is not an argument of its existence rather a condition of it
901644 his hand is swollen and looks green he cries all the time and vomits even though he is not taking in anything
901645 they the municipality were putting down poison for the rats but on the same day i saw a rat nothing is going to change
901646 placing the rat poison is a once off thing we are going to do a large scale clean up as informal settlements are notorious for conditions in which rats breed
901647 the housing department vector control department durban solid waste community mobilisation we are all working together
901648 there will continue to be shack fires rats and spreading of diseases
901649 people use the refuse bags that are provided the problem is no one collects the dirt this area is steep and it would be impossible for residents to carry their filled refuse bags such a distance
901650 people have this misconception that because we live in shacks we are dirty lazy and need education build the necessary infrastructure and if the problems persist then blame us
901651 people have resorted to using the bushes or building homemade toilets that are really just a shallow hole surrounded by planks
901652 we cannot build on the entire site and some people would have to be relocated we are also looking at another site close to kennedy road but are awaiting approval from the provincial department of environmental affairs and the department of water and forestry

901656 ive got stitches in my head and the doctors told me ive got a cracked skull they were shouting that the houses belonged to them and nobody else will have it
901657 they started beating us and even called young boys to join them we ran in different directions and some of us managed to get to bonteheuwel station
901658 they shouted kill them kill them it was horrible the way they carried on they beat us with sticks and it was clear they were determined to kill us i could not get away they threw me on the floor and beat me
901659 together we all started this campaign for houses but im against this brutal attack i will support you
901660 there is no turning back there are many open spaces next to lansdowne road and at ny 112 we wont discuss details now
901661 there have been no arrests well keep a close eye on the situation because we do not want people to get hurt
901662 this is true with employee engagement as well as there are always examples where individuals do things right but unless its fixed at a larger scale it doesnt become cultural or lasting which i think is crucial for engagement
901663 its a tough reality for tv production companies to face but video filesharing is as much a fact of life as its musical cousin and it can have an even more brutal fallout people grab the episode online and then dont watch it when it
901664 stalin once said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic in his books solzhenitsyn managed to reduce the horror of the stalinist regime to a human and palpable level
901665 alexander solzhenitsyn was a man of immense personal courage and as a writer the one indisputable heir of tolstoy
901666 his books came out of intense human suffering and in my opinion that is one of the reasons why he deserved his nobel prize
901667 all solzhenitsyns great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny

901693 they were all previously inmates of work camps or people from the countryside
901694 once they had set up shop it was hard to get them to leave we offered them a deal we set up another night market for them at few blocks away they could work there as long as they stayed away from hunan road but they didnt accept the offer so we had to get tough
901695 there were no regulations allowing us to do what we did but we did it anyway

901716 the proof of anyones products is in the results they produce the fact that i just enjoyed my best tournament of the year and shot all four rounds in the 60s for the first time this season by using their irons and fairway woods says it all

901724 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed

901726 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
901727 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family

901743 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
901744 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
901745 theres been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down communicate theres some things we need to go through and the information that comes out of that will be used to move forward in the decision
901746 this was the goal from day 1 to play for the packers

901748 bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
901749 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage

901855 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
901856 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each

901890 the evidence amassed by fbi investigators against bruce ivins the army scientist who allegedly killed himself last week after learning that he was likely to be charged in the anthrax letter attacks of 2001 was largely circumstantial and a grand jury in washington was planning to hear several more weeks of testimony before issuing an indictment a person who has been briefed on the investigation said sunday while genetic analysis had linked the anthrax letters to a supply of the deadly bacterium in ivins laboratory at fort detrick md at least 10 people had access to the flask containing that anthrax agents from the federal bureau of investigation also have no evidence proving that ivins visited new jersey on the dates in september and october 2001 when investigators believe the letters were sent from a princeton mailbox the source said paul kemp a lawyer for ivins who maintains his clients innocence declined to comment for the record on sunday on the alleged evidence

901898 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
901899 as a result policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow
901900 if the fiscal policy response remains inadequate amidst heightened external shocks or resulted in an intensification of domestic inflation then ratings pressure for a change in indias sovereign ratings outlook from stable to negative would increase
901901 while moodys overall assessment is that the current constellation of risks is captured in the prevailing stable outlook downside pressures could emerge
901902 firstly they could involve deterioration in the governments general debt metrics and its access to external liquidity given intensified commodity price shocks and an inadequate fiscal response
901903 secondly such pressures could be due to the rising risk of fiscal spillovers to indias external accounts
901904 such spillover if large enough could weaken the case for the two notch gap between its foreign currency and local currency ratings
901905 the governments fiscal difficulties relate partly to its inability to raise retail fuel prices and reduce the growing off budget fiscal cost of reimbursing downstream oil companies as part of its subsidies program
901906 the downward bias should continue and the market is likely to move within a range of 13 380 and 14 900 this week with no major positive trigger in sight

901925 to academics and freelance philosophers who theorize about the difficulty of achieving authenticity in the postmodern world the souvenir t shirt is seen as the ultimate defilement to wear one means you had the money to see the sights of the world but not enough wit to do anything other than stare vacantly at them and then wander off in search of a cheeseburger to them i say no way in fact a superficially simple t shirt is a complex weave of symbols and implications travelers hanker for a genuine unique ethnic experience but thats increasingly elusive in a globalized world where you can get good chinese food in iceland and icelandic food in tbilisi georgia a t shirt however is inarguably authentic fat chance that an i heart slovenia t shirt would have been purchased anywhere but that country true you could also purchase an equally authentic slovenian peasant outfit but youre unlikely to wear that to the supermarket back home

902084 we had to get the focus back of course its a confidence boost in a scrimmage with all these people in the stands its wonderful to make a play
902085 if you might make a mistake make it full speed and play hard weve been stressing all week tackling we surrounded the ball real well stopping the run is a big deal and i thought tonight we did a decent job of that
902086 they stress playing very sound man to man defense 11 men to the ball 11 men taking care of their own job if you dont youll definitely hear about it
902087 weve been explosive on offense weve completed a ton of balls our completion percentage has to be 70 to 80 percent altogether tonight it was not smooth we really didnt throw the ball much we really tried to run the ball and struggled it will be there

902114 starts pushing to have the baby before the neck of the womb cervix is open or if she has the baby too fast she can damage the support of the uterus and cause prolapse

902127 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
902128 in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
902129 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
902130 i think we have all been brought up to give too much respect to religion as opposed to any other kind of opinion

902132 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
902133 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle

902143 it is the best selection of livestock i think we have had and we have never had this many trade stands as well
902144 i would like to thank all the farmers for coming out despite the rising costs they are experiencing at the moment
902145 it feels really good to have won these awards in addition to the ones i have won in previous weeks

902170 beaked whale species appear to cease vocalizing and foraging for food in the area around active sonar transmissions
902171 since these animals feed at depth this could have the effect of preventing a beaked whale from feeding over the course of the trial and could lead to second or third order effects on the animal and population as a whole
902172 active sonar releases energy into the ocean and there is evidence to suggest that this may have an effect on marine mammals
902173 environmental impact assessments are mandatory prior to the use of military sonar and the ability to predict and detect marine life continues to be developed in order to minimise any perceived threats to marine life

902222 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount

902241 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected

902270 il grill scavalcava lautostrada come una fortezza io pensavo alle stanze e ai corridoi segreti che cerano in essa alle segrete porticine della recinzione che si aprono su sentieri persi destate fra il granturco o come in quella notte esili e scure tracce fra la neve stavo con la fronte sul cristallo gelido di un finestrone da lontano venivano gli echi i brusii e le luci di una citt mi pare fosse piacenza
902271 e non solo per loro mi ha capito se ognuno di quelli che nella foresta ci rimasto avesse speso per lavorare un quarto della fatica che sprec dietro i suoi sogni mortali si sarebbe arricchito questi posti esistono per dare alluomo la misura di quello che ecco cosa si viene a cercare le garantisco che era questo a bruciare dentro quella gente pi della febbre forse anche in lei perch lei potrebbe diventare il capo della sua universit e ancora non lo saprebbe che uomo la foresta glielo dice in tre giorni

902280 its great to see how quickly all of these athletes progress having their own facility here has made a huge difference to new zealand
902281 youre always thinking of your team and youve got to always put the team first
902282 but you do have to put yourself up for selection try and play your best
902283 i thought bad drought yeah weve had the year from hell but it looks like its going to be the start of another one
902284 because of the length of rainfall weve had the river will very slowly rise and then very slowly fall over a long period of time
902285 weve still got a metre to go before it gets to the rooms
902286 but weve certainly got substantial water covering our grounds and changing shed areas
902287 i dont talk to him long i just wanted to gauge from him is this what he wants to do and he assured me this is what he wants he wants out of there and he wants to come and test himself in rugby union
902288 well just try and keep him busy and keep him focused on what he needs to learn here and that he enjoys his time here i think thats a big part of it
902289 they say class is permanent and you can tell that hes got that so i dont think itll be hard for him at all
902290 i picked beijingticketing com it was the first after i googled the sites and said it was official
902291 we were confident we were on the right track and purchased our tickets which cost me 750 odd dollars but i felt it was a small price to pay to go and see marc win his gold medal
902292 families dont want to wait until athletes are qualified to wait for tickets those tickets have been in the market place for a long time somebodys taken a punt and bought tickets a way out
902293 the bottom line is theyve just got it wrong on this one
902294 this isnt a product that should have a tick purely because of changing the serving size recommendation
902295 this is more about aligning ourselves with the guidelines of lower fat options and serving suggestions
902296 i think they are going to have to change their criteria so a product like this doesnt get in just by changing the recipe
902297 it can be deceptive and theres potential mischief there but we have a role to play in education
902298 as well as showing the public that again the product can be used and enjoyed in this way
902299 hopefully last weekends efforts might sway a few opinions food for thought i guess
902300 weve obviously been kicked out so that we cant carry on our operations to make sure that these guys are doing the right job
902301 i think were too far down the line to actually step back what were doing is were actually going to carry on with the programme but we are certainly very much more aware now of peoples passions about it
902302 i think feelings are running very high and its not going to be avoidable if you keep doing this sort of thing close to people thats whats going to happen
902303 weve never had more potential i dont believe as a sporting nation
902304 just how everyone has fared on the world stage in the last 18 months its been a gradual build over the last few years across all sports
902305 looking at the team now four years on from athens new zealand sport is in really good shape
902306 the olympic games are all about pressure and thats the beauty of it
902307 you have to be within the bubble to know you can perform the number of athletes within that bubble are far more now than what weve ever had
902308 but then putting that onto the court or pitch or track on the day is what the games are all about
902309 all of those that have performed well are in the frame does that mean they will all medal it probably doesnt
902310 we just have to see wait and see what that conversion rate might look like
902311 when we were leaving athens four years ago they were still laying grass in the olympic village
902312 over here theyve got a cast of thousands weeding the beautifully laid grass
902313 the athletes are just amazed that everything they ask for happens in a timely fashion
902314 here if you move away from somewhere someones there cleaning up after you in the dining area you could eat off the floor

902329 shared pain is lessened shared joy increased thus do we refute entropy
902330 more women would surely marry if more men were worth the trouble
902331 im not sure marriage is for everyone for me its a vehicle for personal transformation and growth a crucible in which ones own selfishness gets melted down a refiners fire that purifies
902332 the statistics certainly say what they say but they say no more all it proves is that men remarry more
902333 i question the writers generalization that women delay remarrying because of celebrating their
902334 all the privilege i claim for my own sex is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone
902335 a crucible in which ones own selfishness gets melted down
902336 plus unmarried women is bound to cause much more of a moral panic in our society
902337 but if they do indeed bear the heavier burden in marriage and divorce as some of the commenters here would argue then perhaps they just believe in true love more than women what else could tempt them back into such an apparently distasteful subordinate position where they are only guaranteed to suffer if the relationship goes to pot
902338 but ive read that many women are suspicious never married men past a certain age
902339 they lionize women from cultures whose laws and society see the mans role as breadwinner with the wifes status related to her conspicuous spending of her husbands money
902340 well the statistics show that women do a lot more housework than men still so yep thats your answer
902341 marriage is a direct transfer of womens assets and labor into cold hard cash for men
902342 nowadays people who are married are way happier than before with those marriages
902343 to up the marriage rates men should become more marriageable on average
902344 men should embrace pulling their fair share with open arms
902345 then you probably dont want to marry a woman from the traditional cultures mras are always talking about
902346 our desirability as husbands is increasingly linked to our ability to provide enduring emotional sexual romantic and spiritual satisfaction our relational skills now matter more than our earning potential
902347 it sounds to me that you are not looking for a partner but someone to raise your kids and clean your house
902348 at least everyone would know the score from the outset
902349 i think anonymous provides a partial explanation why women are reticent to remarry
902350 while the wife may seem controling she also helps emotionally help the man not feel alone as we men often feel
902351 if id bought any of this stuff when you were living here you would have complained about spending money
902352 well the statistics show that women do a lot more housework than men still so yep thats your answer a newly divorced man is statistically going to have to up his housework or lower his standard of living
902353 hes kind of an idiot if he thinks american citizenship is a litmus test of suitability for his needs
902354 what kind of moron expects that people here actually have any interest in whom he personally does or doesnt marry
902355 women are living longer as widows and after a divorce are more likely than men to delay remarriage
902356 hes kind of an idiot if he thinks american citizenship is a litmus test of suitability for his needs
902357 what kind of moron expects that people here actually have any interest in whom he personally does or doesnt marry
902358 to the degree that women own their own lives the divorce rate increases
902359 example torture bothers me but it really bothers me when my country does it
902360 until life or evolving or a better match do us part
902361 we stand with the victim and will make sure they are taken care of
902362 im really happy alone i dont know if ill ever marry again
902363 heck ive had men wish for that by their own admission although substitute in the game for soaps
902364 perhaps the answers from a white woman studying for a master degree would be different from those of a black single mom from da hood do they bless their singlehood too
902365 vera i dont think that living together lacks real and tangible benefits
902366 the day will never arrive that i would share my heart with someone only willing to commit
902367 mr bad the rest of your comment has been deleted and you know perfectly well why
902368 i get the feeling from hugo and your post that you are theists
902369 put all the other potential issues factors aside take group a and group b group a on average lives longer than group b if the two groups have equal preference utility functions for x and y then a will have the ability to consume more of both of course in the case of marriage x versus single or cohabitating y there are usually significant transaction costs that make in general choosing between how to consume the two more of a discrete linear process throw in the fact that the situation discussed in the article means the people are currently consuming y after having in most cases consumed x then what a surprise that group b men would choose to switch to consuming x sooner than group a if you want to make more hay out of this article or argue for unequal preference functions between men and women you would have to plow through the statistics on specific age cohorts and control for different life expectancies and other factors before making sweeping conclusions
902370 it is the making of public and enduring promises that marks marriage not state sanction
902371 i am both a theist and religious puritanical actually though not of the spiteful variety i hope if that disqualifies my opinion then so be it
902372 obviously in my comment i was addressing the kinds of relationships that are formed from the first as short term situations i dont believe these are healthy for society or for the people who are abandoned when they end
902373 of course the worst situation is when the couple believes they are in it for the long haul but rejects the paperwork then one member decides its time to move on the legal contract of marriage protects the abandoned party and i recommend it to anyone
902374 that said the flip side of women who wont consider marrying down are men who wont consider marrying up
902375 men cant handle a woman who is more successful than they are because it would hurt their fragile ego
902376 i have much more to say to you more than you can now bear

902390 einen anfall selbstkritischer bescheidenheit oder bescheidener selbstkritik bek me und sagt das war ein fehler dass ich an dieser stelle dazu aufgerufen habe die eigene partei und ihre spitzenkandidatin nicht zu w hlen
902391 kun je daar dan gewoon op heel grote afstand een macro mee maken
902392 wat doet dat mens met dat ding hier raar voor mijn neus
902393 if youve got nothing to hide youve got nothing to fear

902398 since passionates spend a lot of time online on multiple web sites it is important to reach them where they are online
902399 authoring your own blog being present on mainstream social networks and industry targeted communities and participating in other consumer focused question and answer sites are great ways to reach passionates
902400 it goes without saying that real estate professionals should have their own agent or broker web site and that those web sites should incorporate an ongoing search engine optimization effort as well as a sponsored search marketing program
902401 should reinforce your presence online including your web site url your blog url your e mail address or your social network profile names keep in mind that even though their name implies that they are offline conventionals spend time researching online to supplement their offline activities
902402 you should have a presence on many real estate web sites
902403 in particular real estate professionals should distribute their listings to as many real estate search and portal sites as appropriate actives are also busy financing so partnering with mortgage brokers both online and offline is a great way to reach them by sharing referrals
902404 is critical as actives are still contemplating what service providers to collaborate with
902405 once this segment becomes more serious about home shopping and buying they will rely on a real estate agent to assist them so investments that get you in front of their selection process are important
902406 for this group awareness is the most important marketing objective and marketing investments should be geared toward consistently putting your brand front and center graphic media campaigns on newspapers sites and real estate sites that enable local targeting search engine marketing in your local market and listing your profile in the emerging category of online real agent directories should be considered in the marketing mix for this segment
902407 since they are the least knowledgeable about real estate compared to the other segments future prospects are more likely to enlist outside help
902408 law enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
902409 the drug networks are highly fluid adapting effectively to law enforcement interventions
902410 the illegal status of drugs is likely to have contained their availability and use to some extent drug laws do not appear to have direct effects on the prevalence of drug use tougher enforcement measures have not necessarily deterred use
902411 in the past too much emphasis has been placed on lower level street deals what we are trying to deal with are the major importers
902412 there is some evidence that enforcement activity can affect drug prices
902413 there is evidence of the uk wholesale price being greater than that in continental markets
902414 if it was reported in terms of potential deaths it would not sound so appealing
902415 a large haul of cannabis which could have potentially caused zero deaths due to its non lethal status was seized today
902416 a haul of cocaine probably destined for the city of londons night scene which may have potentially caused one death although the alcohol would have been more to blame
902417 the real question is if drug taking is intrinsically evil and like most people i think it is then surely it is essential for the state to at least attempt to supress it
902418 im just wondering how many people on this blog are speaking with a clear head and conscience hands up those who have never taken recreational drugs
902419 if all drugs were no more than a harmless indulgence to all their users i would agree with legalisation theyre not and i suspect most advocates of legalisation do so to cover their own backs first and foremost
902420 in response to shutupstevie 29 its true that the majority of drug use does not lead to other crime in fact i would argue that this widespread largely middle class use is what undermines government attempts to reduce drug availability if you use drugs or your friends or family do youd be crazy to support a policy of zero tolerance coupled with draconian punishments for instance
902421 from a young age i never saw the point of sticking something in your mouth lighting it and then inhaling smoke into your lungs
902422 most advocates of legalisation do so to cover their own backs first and foremost
902423 having spent several years in the far east i can tell you it is possible to stop drugs take singapore for example there are no drugs or drug problem because the consequences of possessing and using them are so bad we should follow this example not the netherlands one where from personal experience heroin is available in many train stations eg den haag hs
902424 i have made it clear that i am not in favour of recreational drugs but i have not stated my position on legalization
902425 i find it interesting that my comments have provoked such emotive and largely defensive responses
902426 good for you usdeeper glad to know im not alone
902427 there is no need for me to have had first hand experience of drugs to be able to see the detrimental effects they have on those around me including cigarettes and alcohol
902428 good for you usdeeper glad to know im not alone
902429 see the detrtimental effects of drugs on the people around you
902430 one in three people have taken drugs such as ecstasy cocaine cannabis and amyl nitrate at work
902431 why are cigarettes and booze not controlled by organized crime
902432 reply to masonity i think you are missing the point darling also if you think cannabis for example does not lead to deaths maybe you should do some research
902433 having to legally recognise some very nasty people who are currently involved in the trade
902434 there would be people who would self harm through drugs and would blame the change of policy it would take a mature society to accept that some individuals may hurt or even kill themselves as a result of a policy change even if the evidence suggested that fewer people died or were harmed as a result im not sure our media society is ready to deal with that degree of reason it would take a brave government to face down the tabloid fury in the face of anecdotes about nice middle class children who bought drugs legally and came to grief
902435 cannabis contains about 400 times as many carcinogens as tobacco and because the smoke is hotter you get greater inflammation in the mouth which is the first hit in cancer development
902436 its quite easy to see why because theres a lot of votes to lose by being pro drugs
902437 seriously though its obviously up to individuals to choose what personal risks they take in their recreation
902438 cannabis contains about 400 times as many carcinogens as tobacco and because the smoke is hotter you get greater inflammation in the mouth which is the first hit in cancer development my father is a senior cancer surgeon and is treating an epidemic in oral cancer in people in their early 20s who dont smoke tobacco
902439 i have no problem with people smoking a bit of dope but claims that yours that its totally safe are utter rubbish
902440 if you really think this then id wonder about the brain cell damage too
902441 if we legalise do we legalise completely eg demand and supply for there will always be those times at 3 30am when the addict needs a fix but the chemists are closed so there may still be dealers around for those awkward moments
902442 send out a false message that those seriously dangerous drugs are not seriously dangerous
902443 you have no idea what the results of a free for all would be
902444 it is not just a matter of cost it is a self evident fact that these drugs cause harm to the users and the users often cause harm to others
902445 equally are the people who are making all this money and paying no taxes suddenly going to go legit and fill in a tax form
902446 the real question is if drug taking is intrinsically evil and like most people i think it is then surely it is essential for the state to at least attempt to supress it
902447 far from de glamourising drugs this would have the reverse impact and could only lead to far greater drug use
902448 this evening i joined thousands of people outside the birds nest olympic stadium we all jammed together by the
902449 thats it im off on my hols rarely have i gone away so uncertain what the next few months will

902458 on one hand australia is an oasis of game development with a thriving highly skilled industry generating hundreds of millions of dollars of valuable export revenue
902459 on the other hand australias lack of an r18 classification means that some of the worlds most important video games are effectively banned from appearing down under at all
902460 in other words adding an r18 certification will put more games unsuitable for minors on the shelves and thats simply more important than your rights as an adult
902461 thats quite a leap in logic and a frankly outrageous position to take in my view can you imagine the same the same justification being used for any medium other than video games
902462 whats more south australian attorney general michael atkinson seems not to believe that there exists the facility to stop children from playing adult games
902463 australias absence of an r18 category and the financial imperative of getting a game onto store shelves in a timely manner means that many games intended for adult audiences and rated 18 in other countries are inappropriately shoehorned into the existing ma15 category in australia
902464 far from protecting minors from adult content our uniquely incomplete classification system has allowed them in many cases to legally purchase and access such content a consistent classification system would better serve to protect the rights of children as well as ensuring those of adults are not infringed
902465 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended

902607 but although it is disappointing to lose to a late goal im really pleased with the performance if that was a league two game and we were at home then our keeper has had far too much to do and if robbie blake keeps himself in good nick then for me he could still play in the premier league
902608 yes burnley had a lot of chances but we created some as well their keeper made a couple of good saves and paul mclaren had one cleared off the line so if we can create chances against their first choice back four then thats very pleasing
902609 last year we played a 4 5 1 against them because it was my first look at it and i didnt want us to get beat this time we had a go with 4 4 2 and i thought we gave them a very good game
902610 it was a hard fought game and i was pleased because i felt we passed the ball well all credit to bradford because they posed a threat at times throughout the game but we created some real scoring chances tonight and i thought their keeper was outstanding
902611 we just need to add that clinical touch because there may be games when you only get one or two chances having said that it was very pleasing overall and our fitness levels looked very strong in the second half culminating in us scoring a late winning goal
902612 who could to into a small shop and set up to do either

902623 amos and i sat down on the monday both very concerned with the direction and form of the team we both decided that a change in leadership might help rejuvenate this group of players despite going winless for two months were still very much in contention for a playoff position our goal of making the playoffs and competing for a championship remains the same despite the recent set backs

902673 many people today suffer from metabolic syndrome which occurs as a result of dietary imbalance
902674 the syndrome is associated with eight degenerative diseases the first is overweight disorder then high blood pressure high cholesterol and high blood sugar then you have type two diabetes cardiovascular diseases heart attacks and strokes four kinds of cancer breast prostate colon endometrial osteoarthritis and finally gall bladder disease all this is basically because people eat too many carbohydrates thats partly because its the cheapest food and also because the food industry keeps throwing sugar into everything to make it taste good
902675 healthy cells contain proteins that span the entire charge spectrum from negatively charged proteins to positively charged protein health means that theres a balance between negatively charged proteins and positively charged proteins this is essential for core body health because the 25 000 proteins in the body are its worker bees
902676 the synthesis of negatively charged proteins continues but the synthesis of positively charged proteins is greatly diminished and this impairs cell function causing further disease all foods made in bulk in nature contain negatively charged proteins things like whey soy casein and egg white and when we get meat at the store its usually muscle which is also mainly negatively charged proteins
902677 unless of course you eat like your grandparents did tripe kidney or stomach you get much more of a protein balance from organ meat but people dont eat all that much of it anymore
902678 you could make up for a positively charged protein deficiency by eating protein with an overall negative charge
902679 eleven are nonessential meaning our body makes them and nine are essential meaning our body doesnt make them and we must get them from our diets as we age there are two things that prevent us from getting those essential amino acids we fall into poor eating habits taking in lots of carbohydrates and less protein rich food and also the aging process interferes with the digestive process leading to further deficiencies in amino acids and positively charged proteins i call this the food chain gap
902680 by the end of the first week you have more pep and energy
902681 reset the metabolic pathways and thats why you get more pep and energy plus it burns calories they can even improve mood three of those amino acids are direct precursors to neurotransmitters in the brain two of them are dopamine and serotonin which are related to pleasure this means they can also relieve stress anxiety mood swings and depression because they reach the brain within minutes the amino acids also signal the brains appetite centers that the body is well fed and that leads to feelings of comfort satisfaction and well being
902682 i used to get three viruses a year but ive been using factor4 weight control for two and a half years and i dont get sick anymore
902683 anti aging health living longer with improved quality of life
902684 with factor 4 hair and nails grow twice as fast and skin has more blood supply and elasticity these things lead to a more youthful look
902685 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging

902719 saya sering menjumpai orang orang yang bekerja selama 12 jam sehari 6 hari seminggu atau lebih beberapa diantaranya melakukan hal tersebut karena diburu buru oleh deadline memenuhi target yang telah ditetapkan
902720 tapi hidup kita tidak seluruhnya matematika dan angka angka ada dimensi non matematis dan di luar angka angka logis
902721 ya kalau kita hanya tertuju pada gaji kita akan menjadi orang pelit individualis bahkan bisa jadi tamak loba karena berapapun sebenarnya nilai gaji setiap orang dia tidak akan pernah merasa cukup lalu dia akan berkata bagaimana mau sedekah untuk kita saja kurang
902722 mana mungkin dengan gaji sebesar itu kita bisa hidup tenang bisa sedekah bisa berbagi
902723 tapi saya jawab masih ada kita masih memiliki sisa seribu rupiah dan seribu rupiah itu abadi bahkan memancing rezeki yang tidak terduga
902724 ya memang habis karena kita masih memakai logika matematis tapi cobalah tinggalkan pola pikir itu dan beralihlah pada logika sedekah uang yang seribu itu dinikmati pengemis jangan salah bisa jadi puluhan lontaran doa keberkahan untuk kita keluar dari mulut pengemis itu atas pemberian kita itu baru satu pengemis bagaimana jika kita memberikannya lebih itu dicatat malaikat dan didengar allah itu menjadi sedekah kita pada allah dan menjadi penolong di akhirat sesungguhnya yang seribu itulah milik kita yang abadi sementara nilai bakso dan es campur itu ujung ujungnya masuk wc
902725 terus gimana caranya mas agar bisa menyeimbangkan nilai metematis dengan dimensi sedekah itu
902726 pertama ingat sedekah tidak akan membuat orang jadi miskin tapi sebaliknya menjadikan ia kaya kedua jangan terikat dengan keterbatasan gaji tapi percayalah pada keluasan rizki ketiga lihatlah ke bawah jangan lihat ke atas dan yang terakhir padukanlah nilai qonaah ridha dan syukur
902727 mengapa dokter meminta izin saya bukankan setiap pagi saya membeli berbagai macam obat di apotek dokter tidak meminta izin saya

902729 dokter tolong usahakan sekali lagi mencari penyakit isteriku sementara saya akan berdoa kepada yang maha kuasa agar penyakit istri saya segera ditemukan
902730 pak jamil kami sudah berusaha semampu kami bahkan kami telah meminta bantuan berbagai laboratorium dan penyakit istri bapak tidak bisa kami deteksi secara tepat kami harus sangat hati hati memberi obat karena istri bapak juga sedang hamil 8 bulan baiklah kami akan coba satu kali lagi tapi kalau tidak ditemukan kami harus mengganti obatnya pak
902731 ya allah ya tuhanku aku mengerti bahwa engkau pasti akan menguji semua hamba mu akupun mengerti bahwa setiap kebaikan yang aku lakukan pasti akan engkau balas dan akupun mengerti bahwa setiap keburukan yang pernah aku lakukan juga akan engkau balas ya tuhanku gerangan keburukan apa yang pernah aku lakukan sehingga engkau uji aku dengan sakit isteriku yang berkepanjangan tabunganku telah terkuras tenaga dan pikiranku begitu lelah berikan aku petunjuk ya tuhanku engkau maha tahu bahkan engkau mengetahui setiap guratan urat di leher nyamuk dan engkaupun mengetahui hal yang kecil dari itu aku pasrah kepada mu ya tuhanku sembuhkanlah istriku bagimu amat mudah menyembuhkan istriku semudah engkau mengatur milyaran planet di jagat raya ini
902732 jangan jangan inilah hukum alam dan ketentuan yang maha kuasa bahwa bila saya berbuat keburukan maka saya akan memperoleh keburukan dan keburukan yang saya terima adalah penyakit isteri saya ini karena saya pernah menyakiti ibu saya dengan mengambil uang yang ia miliki itu
902733 bu apakah ibu ingat ketika ibu kehilangan uang sebayak seratus dua puluh lima rupiah beberapa puluh tahun yang lalu
902734 sampai kapanpun ibu ingat mil kualat yang ngambil duit itu mil duit itu sangat ibu perlukan untuk membayar hutang kok ya tega teganya ada yang ngambil
902735 ibu maafkan saya yang ngambil uang itu saya bu saya minta maaf sama ibu saya minta maaaaf saat nanti ketemu saya akan sungkem sama ibu saya jahat telah tega sama ibu
902736 ya tuhan pernyataanku aku cabut yang ngambil uangku tidak kualat aku maafkan dia ternyata yang ngambil adalah anak laki lakiku jamil kamu nggak usah pikirin dan doakan saja isterimu agar cepat sembuh
902737 selamat pak penyakit isteri bapak sudah ditemukan infeksi pankreas ibu telah kami obati dan panasnya telah turun setelah ini kami akan operasi untuk mengeluarkan bayi dari perut ibu

902743 im actually from horn lake ms but now i live in olive branch same thing really but anyway yeah i grew up a memphis fan too but when i got out of college and before i got this job at cbs i covered the tigers for five seasons for the commercial appeal in memphis and the fan aspect totally disappeared i mean sitting courtside at this years national title game shouldve been one of the highlights of my life but it wasnt i was indifferent to the whole thing and i dont say that in an attempt to prove im impartial it kinda makes me sad actually because the main reason i wanted to be a sports writer was because i loved sports and i dont really love sports anymore dont get me wrong i love my job and consider myself lucky to have it but i have no emotional interest in any team in any sport anymore and sometimes i wish that wasnt so because theres something nice about living and dying with a team
902744 i covered the mike tyson lennox lewis fight while at the commercial appeal that was just tremendous i was on the tyson beat all week so i spent 10 hours a day around tyson obviously that was interesting and i found tyson to be a compelling figure hes insane for sure or at least bipolar but he was pleasant and genuinely kind to most people that week and thats the way i remember him anyway fight night was like nothing i had ever seen denzel washington leonardo dicaprio tobey maguire and practically every other major star was there just walking around the floor honestly you couldnt take five steps without bumping into somebody and the 20 minutes leading up to the main event was the most electric atmosphere ive ever encountered all in all it was a fabulous night for everybody except tyson of course
902745 oh sure there are tons this is a sketchy sport but what people dont realize is that things like the albert means scandal are incredibly difficult to uncover and report because you basically need somebody on the inside who is willing to sacrifice himself to bring down others and those people are rare without milton kirk i wouldve never been able to uncover that scandal and do you remember what happened to milton he was fired indicted and is now a convicted felon that was his reward for coming forward and telling the truth he destroyed his own life and how many people are willing to do that just to tell some reporter about a scandal not many and thats why the means story was so rare because what i had was a guy who was pissed to the point where it meant more to him to bring down another person than it did to save his own career there arent many people like that which is why most scandals are never uncovered even though im confident there are similar stories every year
902746 in short no the ncaa can make as many rules as it wants but college coaches are smart and creative and theyll always figure out a way to get things done if you will this is a business built around men making millions of dollars to win basketball games and its hard to win without great players consequently its crucial for a coach to get great players and a man will always find a loophole in the system when his livelihood depends on it
902747 i think its a rule suggestion that cant be enforced and completely unnecessary in most cases the coaches and parents can handle this on their own as far as im concerned if a kid wants to commit and a coach wants to commit him who is the nabc to step in the way plus basketball is a sport where the elite players can usually be tabbed pretty early we knew about o j mayo when he was in middle school lebron james was considered a future nba star by the time he was a sophomore as was greg oden in other words its not crazy to peg a young prospect as a future division i player so i dont have a problem with a college coach who wants to do it and get a headstart on the process because if youre not in front of the game you are behind
902748 i think the world of him as a coach there are people who love him and people who dont love him but even the ones who dont usually acknowledge hes good at what he does hes smarter than you think smarter than he lets on so though i know he got off to a terrible start in his uk career i cant imagine any scenario under which he doesnt return uk to prominence hes too good at and to obsessed with his job to not succeed
902749 obviously kentucky would be his dream job and you could make the argument that if he and gillispie switched places they might both be more comfortable as for moving up the ladder if he wins at osu and the fans t boone pickens included fall in love with him the school will make it difficult to leave because nobody will outbid pickens put another way i think kentucky might be the only step up for travis because if he fails nobody else will want him and if he succeeds nobody else will be able to pay what oklahoma state will be willing to pay so hes in a good spot i wish i had his salary

902787 i felt it on friday after the game but i didnt pay any attention to it
902788 saturday i didnt do anything today i was stretching going out to throw and i felt it so they decided to shut me down for the day everythings going to be fine im not worried at all
902789 we knew we were going to have to manipulate our bullpen a little bit
902790 you know that you dont have mo today and youre asking for big outs from some young guys down there
902791 thats part of their maturation process they have to go through
902792 i know that in the three days it had really gotten better its going to take some time its a situation where were in this part of the season where you have enough time to take some time off and get back healthy for the push
902793 im not really too worried about the trade stuff because i was more worried about trying to help my team
902794 were still in a playoff race down there with binghamton
902795 well of course my mentality going into every single practice whoever im going against i feel as if nobody can guard me
902796 if you dont have that mentality youre already setting yourself up for failure
902797 ive just been seeing him make plays thats all ive been seeing
902798 i saw that last pass coming and i was like no no no because he keller was flying
902799 he was rolling down the middle of the field but hes doing a great job man hes got everyone excited
902800 i think that the play that he scored on is a really good look on how a tight end can affect the defense
902801 deep down the middle of the field he gets over the top catches it you miss one tackle and you go the distance
902802 he went one on one with a safety abram elam for us thats a pretty good matchup when youve got dustin keller running down the middle of the field i just threw that to an area and let him go get it
902803 we dont want to be having to scoreboard watch come september nows the time we have to push weve got some guys that are banged up a little bit weve got some injuries but nows the time that weve got to push through that i dont want to have to be making up too much ground come september
902804 my cleats slipped out on me but its a ball i should have had
902805 yeah he was brain dead or something went wrong with him right there
902806 hes probably one of our more what we consider intelligent players his brain got some things crossed up and he decided to take off hes a better player than that and he knows its not a good situation
902807 when i say oops i dont question anything i did
902808 if we string together some wins you can say this jump started us
902809 christian takes the biggest gamble of the game there and changes the complexion of the at bat and the whole inning
902810 its more motivated by a combination of those things and the fact that we know he could use that rest so it kind of goes both ways
902811 im more than capable of pitching any time next week
902812 i still feel it a little bit but its 100 percent better than it was last week it getting better every day and feels fine
902813 the fans here are amazing theres nowhere else id rather play
902814 obviously you play this game to play in october and win a world championship its just fun to be a part of this and experience august and september and hopefully october it makes me very excited and rejuvenated to show up at the park
902815 i came over and right out of the chute i kind of crashed
902816 but thats the nature of trying to make a first impression now i feel like im starting to settle in and relax and join in a little
902817 i think i was getting a drink of water and its always so loud in here anyway so i didnt even know what was going on
902818 then somebody said to me they want you and someone else pushed me up the stairs it was neat especially since i never had one before
902819 its so much more exciting to play where the games are meaningful
902820 you look ahead in the schedule and you see all the important games and you just want to be a part of it
902821 there aint no magic trick or nothing you just kind of jump up and hope for the best

902851 he made a giant step forward today by not running away from the images
902852 next week we are hoping he may actually touch a wedding dress

902865 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
902866 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
902867 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
902868 we are going to be in this for the long haul
902869 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
902870 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
902871 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
902872 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response
902873 there are two routes leading to the temple and the barricades put up to streamline human traffic broke down and in the melee everything went haywire
902874 it was raining very heavily and the crowds had swelled immensely and as soon as the rain stopped people tried to rush ahead
902875 there was a man with his child and he was shaking the child to see if he was alive and all the time tears were flowing down his cheeks
902876 no one from the police or administration was helping and it was just people helping each other in the pouring rain
902877 there was total chaos everywhere and i saw dead bodies everywhere and blood soaked survivors crying for help
902878 i am so shocked that i am trembling in my house and terrified to step out and go to work
902879 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
902880 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
902881 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
902882 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering
902883 if the camps had really been stupid and wasteful and tragic that meant that the soviet union was stupid and wasteful and tragic too
902884 now i read and weep but when i was imprisoned in ukhta for ten years i did not shed a tear
902885 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
902886 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence
902887 i feel that yeltsin permitted an enormous devastation of russia
902888 millions of people associate the name and work of alexander solzhenitsyn with russias fate
902889 his academic research outstanding literary work and in fact his entire life have been dedicated to the fatherland
902890 how can you expect a man who is warm to understand a man who is cold
902891 the tokyo market faces a tough environment as japanese corporate earnings are taking a turn for the worse and economies at home and abroad are deteriorating
902892 the market needs to see the specifics of the plan and wait and see how the plan will actually unfold
902893 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
902894 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
902895 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
902896 they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
902897 when a man stands between two choices or to be killed by his people or to be arrested by his enemy and he reaches a conclusion that it is better to be arrested by his enemy it shows you how cruel the situation is in gaza
902898 fatah officials in gaza should stay in their posts and should not leave gaza to hamas
902899 will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity
902900 and seriously even if the argument that hillary is more electable had any validity to it its not like we can just give her the nomination and everything would be cool she has failed to win the nomination and superdelegates overturning the will of the voters is not what the democratic party needs to unite
902901 i like how there a bunch of hillary crazies pretending to be from other countries and acting like they like hillary if you polled the rest of the world obama would be overwhelmingly popular also hillary started with every advantage possible look at the polls from the summer and obama has had to make up ground in every sate hillary was arrogant enough to assume she had it in the bag before anyone voted and then she was blindsided by the excellently run obama camapaign and his millions of volunteers and contributors
902902 lol okay a little problem here just my two cents first lets do a worst case scenario for clinton if 10 25 etc of obamas supporters stay home just for the sake of fairness be sure to do a scenario whereas clinton gains the nomination and you factor in the ranges of possible fallout percentages within the democratic party i am guessing a minimum of a 20 30 loss of obama voters but you can play around with that as you wish next you also need to have a scenario whereas she loses varying percentages of the obama vote due to the fall out at the convention as stated above and include the loss of 7 10 of her own voters that admittedly wont vote for her in november versus mccain check the exit polls of pa oh and in certainly these numbers would be equally important in deciding which candidate is strongest
902903 just as an addendum in states such as oh pa nj and ct the white and hispanic vote is fairly evenly split 45 55
902904 also a little factoid even within her own camp their is serious doubt she can carry fl
902905 just as an addendum in states such as oh pa nj and ct the white and hispanic vote is fairly evenly split 45 55 with the white vote typically favoring the republican candidate where do the dems make up ground you guessed it that non essential meaningless black vote good luck with that if you steal the nomination from the first black presidential candidate every democrat needs at least 85 90 of the aa vote to carry some of these states check out kerry and gores raw numbers from some of these typically blue states can she win fl with 10 of the black vote hint gore had over 90 do you really believe she is going to get that in november be honest
902906 also of note is that the number of obama voters unwilling to vote for clinton is somewhat misleading
902907 i somewhat disagree i think ca amp ny should be used as diversionary tactic only mccain must go for oh pa amp fl theres no question about that but theres real secret here what he should do and what he is actually doing is going after wa amp or its brilliant whoever he has on his side actually knows what they are doing a win in or guarantees mccain the white house even if obama carries all 5 of ia mi wi oh amp pa im still baffled that the dems arent deeply troubled by this imagine carrying all those swing states and still lose

902964 saas is spreading throughout the enterprise whether the vendors or their offerings are ready to support and deliver what users want
902965 providers are therefore expanding and improving saas offerings to meet and exceed user desire and demand as well as to establish and extend their competitive advantages
902966 the vendors most challenged by saas will be the thousands of smaller independent software vendors that see opportunity in saas but are uncertain of what needs to be done to take advantage of it

903017 obama is het type politicus dat in nederland door iemand als rita verdonk wordt vertegenwoordigd hun retoriek maakt diepe indruk en wekt bij veel kiezers vertrouwen maar in feite zeggen ze niets en daarom is de vraag volledig op zijn plaats hoe terecht die diepe indruk en dat vertrouwen is zoals verdonk in nederland grossiert in vaagheden over daadkracht zonder een moment duidelijk te maken waarop die daadkracht zich gaat richten en waarin die zal bestaan zo rept obama strijk en zet over change zonder duidelijk te maken wat er moet worden veranderd en waarin die veranderingen zal moeten bestaat en sprak hij in berlijn over nieuwe muren die in eensgezindheid tussen landen volken en gelovigen en tussen amerika en europa moeten worden geslecht

903041 i think that the relationship with china is one that weve been cultivating and improving for some time now and my appointment certainly does not get in the way of that but i dont think its a signal of any profound change in foreign policy
903042 emerson is well respected he may well represent the prime ministers voice on this front
903043 as important as he is now as foreign minister probably the most respected senior minister now in all the harper governments but still it is not enough when it comes to china
903044 you need to have the prime ministers direct engagement that is where the key problem is
903045 harper is not committing to visiting china any time soon
903046 why everybody else other heads of state of g8 are visiting china are engaging china for improving chinas human rights for improving economic relations to promote jobs and investments and our prime minister is not doing so
903047 ive believed for a long time in my discussions with the prime minister and he agrees youve got to engage china
903048 weve got issues around human rights rule of law and those kinds of issues youve got to find a way to ensure that we can continue to promote those issues with greatest effect
903049 we have to manage the relationship and thats certainly going to be a top priority for me

903085 operationally at the micro level there should be no earnings impact for both yards through 2010 as a result of these events we are more concerned that these two separate events may have industrywide macro implications
903086 if these announced events are beginnings of a genuine credit crunch current global backlog size as reported may be overstated on recent order additions and these conditions may lead to further contraction in new ship building contract consummations in our view
903087 right now consumers would rather postpone the decision than make a decision on a car purchase
903088 theyre suspicious about whats happening in the economy and they dont want to make a big ticket purchase

903123 i saw the grenade land in front of me so i had a split second decision to decide what to do i had a quick look around and there was nowhere to take cover i knew there was two lads who were directly behind me and a third further back than that
903124 so i thought im going to get seriously injured whatever i do so i might as well jump in front of the grenade and at least try and save the rest of the lads from getting seriously injured or killed themselves so i lay in front of the grenade
903125 when i was lying there i had that same feeling in your stomach you have when youre a small child and youve done something really naughty and you know you are going to get into lots of trouble for it
903126 so i lay there just gritting my teeth waiting for the explosion to go off

903178 with the rising tide of boomer retirees employers will be losing key talent at a time when attracting and retaining skilled workers will be more important than ever
903179 at the same time rising medical costs lengthening life spans and the declining prevalence of traditional pension and retiree medical benefits mean that employees will either have to work longer save more or live with significantly less than they are accustomed to
903180 as these trends converge we believe phased retirement programs will continue to become more attractive options for both employers and employees they provide employers with new ways to retain critical talent and at the same time help employees meet their needs
903181 working with senior management to determine how phased retirement programs will benefit both employers and employees is an important first step however in order to create a truly successful program its critical employers understand employees perspectives
903182 gathering formal input from employees through focus groups or other initiatives will enable companies to design programs that can truly help with retention needs but do so in a cost efficient way
903183 this is particularly important for employers concerned about workers in specific roles or with specialised skills that represent the greatest risk of loss to the organization
903184 developing phased retirement programs specifically aligned to the needs and desires of the workforce are really effective at helping companies decrease the loss of key skills within their organization
903185 perhaps one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to determine what will be most beneficial to near retirement employees is to simply ask them what type of arrangement would be most effective
903186 is it the ability to work part time on a year round basis or is it some other type of flexible arrangement such as seasonal or project based assignments do they want to step away from demanding management roles what many companies will find is that their existing flexible work arrangements may be easily adaptable to their retirement eligible employees
903187 there are multiple barriers women face that automatically put them at a disadvantage when it comes to meeting adequate retirement income levels some of which are preventable and some of which are not
903188 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
903189 the architects taken a lot of care and put a lot of attention into designing the building so that we get a lot of natural light penetrating into the building
903190 theres a thing called the albeto effect where the light comes down and hits the roof and bounces off it causes a lot of temperature variation in the building
903191 the green roof will help to mediate that to a certain degree and help keep the building cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter
903192 were going to be using a lot of native vegetation so were not going to require an irrigation system on the roof
903193 when you have that type of system the water comes into the green roof and is pretty much stored within the green roof and utilized by the plants

903196 we took a position in relation to worker safety which resulted from two major rock bursts in the raw water tunnel
903197 these failures were unexpected dangerous and caused bilfinger berger to have grave concerns about the safety of the project and the viability of continuing to tunnel as planned with the specified tbms tunnel boring machines
903198 it is the opinion of three of the worlds top experts in tunneling and rock mechanics that the plan to address bilfinger bergers concerns was appropriate and could proceed safely
903199 tunnel support was anticipated in other areas of the tunnel and could be applied to deal with this specific problem
903200 our position is that their metro vancouver design does not recognize the dynamic load and explosive nature of rock bursting
903201 the initial assessment of the geology does not consider the high level of pressure in the rock what they put forward was a range of recommendations not a design to complete the tunnel
903202 after our members were injured and exposed to unsafe conditions at the site bilfinger berger made the correct decision to temporarily suspend the work pending a review and analysis of the rock behaviour
903203 in our dealing with metro vancouver we asked them to undertake a number of tests to look at rock strength in situ stress levels and the length of the tunnel that may be affected by the fault zone
903204 we wanted to use an independent analyst to do the tests but metro vancouver refused the offer
903205 from the time of the tunneling stoppage metro vancouver has refused or otherwise failed to pay any of the costs of bilfinger bergers labour materials and equipment to maintain its forces in readiness to continue work
903206 as of june 13 2008 the amounts outstanding from metro vancouver to bilfinger berger for these unpaid invoices unpaid holdback and applicable taxes total 22 549 579 46 excluding accruing interest

903275 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
903276 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it

903278 its one small paragraph in a much much bigger bill
903279 but it means a lot to doctors in guilford county and their patients
903280 i dont want to get too excited because there still is some chance gov easley would veto it
903281 we never opposed the concept of tax free drug samples in our tax department
903282 but we just wanted to be certain we complied with the state department of revenues directive and state law i think theres a lot of momentum for this new bill to become law we will certainly do whatever state law says
903283 weve had just slews of calls as you can imagine
903284 the passing of this senate bill its very positive for the patients and very positive for the medical practices of guilford county were very pleased
903285 uninsured and underinsured we have untold numbers of people whose lives could depend on free samples
903286 it is my hope that because the amendment was actually more of a clarification and especially since it was spoken about as a clarification on the floors of the house and senate that eagle should not have to pay that tax because it was never the intent
903287 this is something that will be discussed at length by the state department of revenue
903288 one small amendment among something like 13 pages worth of bill

903325 my friends had planned a surprise party for me as my birthday was clashing with friendship day but instead we decided to go cancer hospital and celebrate both the events there
903326 many of these children didnt know the meaning of friendship day but when we told them how youngsters celebrate this day and they have come here to make them their friends they got really excited
903327 for these children life is miserable as except their family members and doctors no body touches or talks without wearing a mask so when we tied them bands and gave them chocolates it seemed that they got a fresh life
903328 it was a chance visit to the remote areas of navsari that changed my perception of life i saw abject poverty and misery there with no proper educational facilities above all for their health condition was bad as there were no qualified medical officers around
903329 i realised that instead of donating money one should reach directly specialist doctors were motivated to provide their services for the camp special jeeps were also organized to ferry patients to the base medical camp from over 30 hinterland villages there
903330 these regions are bereft of any benefits of civilization be it as basic as water food and shelter for the inhabitants malnutrition is rampant and night blindness is a curse that many tribal children are saddled with for life so used are the tribals to their sufferings that they do not even know what it is to be like healthy and normal such is the level of ignorance
903331 it was around four months ago when reshma developed high fever and i took her to the civil hospital in jamnagar she had fallen sick immediately after her father died sometime back
903332 when she came she was like any other child who comes for treatment but soon after i learnt that she had lost her father recently and was struggling to survive her condition reminded me of my own childhood as my father too had died when i was an infant remembering the times when i needed my father i told myself no child deserves to go through that phase i will stand by reshma in this battle of hers
903333 i am a contract labourer myself with no regular income i have been taking help from friends and family back in jamnagar for money so that we can continue the treatment of reshma
903334 we brought her here and consulted the doctors but then it is a very expensive affair

903341 a good deal more than reason goes into the acceptance of such a theory at the grand evolutionary story
903342 even if all the data point to an intelligent designer such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not materialistic
903343 a possible explanation of equal intellectual respectability to naturalism and to my mind greater elegance
903344 that this one world is the way it is because it is the creation of the will of a creator who purposes that it should be so
903345 why believe that there is a god at all my answer is that to suppose that there is a god explains why there is a world at all and so much else in fact the hypothesis of the existence of god makes sense of the whole of our experience and it does better than any other explanation which can be put forward and that is the grounds for believing it to be true
903346 the theory of evolution is by no means religiously or theologically neutral

903395 the confidence he gained in otas and the minicamp has carried over here to the training camp
903396 i think he has more confidence in the routes hes running and knowing what hes doing it shows up
903397 as soon as last season ended everyone else probably wanted to rest
903398 i wanted to get to where we are right now
903399 the last two years have given me some motivation im learning my plays inside and out and to believe in myself now i can play full speed and play football like i have since i was little my biggest problem was i would run and not have a clear mind now i know the plays like the back of my hand
903400 i faced a lot of great athletes in college who are in the pros now
903401 you cant make mistakes at this level that was my biggest problem last year the coaches didnt have confidence i would make plays consistently consistency and eliminating the mental errors is the biggest thing they want out of you
903402 now is my time to show them they wont have to second guess why they did that
903403 it means a lot to me to give back to the kids
903404 there is a chance there could be several new guys on the punt team from a year ago
903405 he brings a lot to the table as a rusher because he has some quickness and physicality about him
903406 he played with some bumps and bruises last year if we can keep him out there and healthy i think hell make a big impact on the defense and on the pass rush
903407 hes taken some opportunities to try to make plays down the field that maybe last year he wouldnt make because he would just take what the defense gave him
903408 but i think he has a better command of the offense hes trying to anticipate when he can make the play down the field so i think some of that has occurred
903409 its up to the coaches to decide whether i do that all i can control is my effort and the way i play its a lot of competition but its healthy competition
903410 its a great feeling i love it im telling the coaches to give me a wristband with the plays on it
903411 i have broken in hundreds of horses but this horse is the first to have broken my heart smolenski later told carville
903412 he was one hell of a handful to do anything with it took an awful long time to iron him out and we had no option but to geld him carville said
903413 he still had a few issues when he went to david and catherine butts for proper training after he was broken in dave carville recalled
903414 unfortunately she shattered a pastern and had to be retired carville recalled
903415 we tried all sorts of innovative remedies and treatments and he seemed very lethargic before he eventually came right

903430 unacceptable and scarcely in line with the current emphasis on decency
903431 they are internally investigated by a trained race equality officer and a formal disciplinary investigation is commissioned if there is a need for further investigation
903432 there was a disturbance in the market place involving rival football fans
903433 we received a report of 20 male youths fighting outside the boot and shoe pub
903434 six arrests were made and those people have been bailed pending further inquiries
903435 there was no damage to any property one man was taken to darlington memorial hospital with a suspected broken finger
903436 one person was hit over the head with a chair outside the pennyweight pub on the other side of the market place
903437 it looks like the trouble stemmed from the fact that it was a meeting between a scottish and an english side
903438 people can get very passionate when that is the case
903439 the entire incident was captured on cctv so we will be viewing the footage
903440 by the time we were alerted it looked like it had been going on for a few minutes but it was over fairly quickly because of the rapid police response
903441 no officers were injured and the police dog was not needed
903442 the allotment is cleaner than half the houses they have sent us to
903443 given that she has been classified as intentionally homeless social housing is not a realistic option
903444 the only other option is to try to secure accommodation for the family in the private rented sector
903445 due to the number of dependent children involved in this matter we have done over and above what is required of us by law
903446 in fact david maugham once had a union jack shaved into his head in a protest about being left out of the british team and apparently has much the same temperament as football manager alex ferguson pretty cheerful most of the time but someone to be approached with extreme caution when things arent going so well
903447 im not sure i play any differently im more consistent and im used to playing more so i hit the shots a little bit better
903448 it will take more than a bit of rain to spoil this years show it has been a wonderful day
903449 we have been chatting to people and they have all said what a great day out it has been
903450 when the rain came people just continued with the same enthusiasm even the crowds did not go away which was great there was a lovely strength of support coming from them
903451 we had about 1 000 people taking part the biggest number we have ever had
903452 we had a bit of a party at the other end when we reached the trinity gardens and everyone enjoyed it
903453 we are already looking to next year and planning the theme we hope to get even more people involved
903454 we could not be happier not many people have been through what we have been through but it is a real happy ending
903455 i used to see this gorgeous girl walking down the street every morning and one day i finally plucked up the courage to ask her out
903456 i used to run round my milk round so i could finish up in time to meet her before she went to work i was the fastest milkman around
903457 he made me break it off because he thought we were too young
903458 as soon as my parents found out i was pregnant there was no way i was going to be allowed to keep the baby and put a slur on my family
903459 that was the way it was in those days my father was very strict
903460 i had to go into a mother and baby home and look after david for the first six weeks
903461 i remember the day they took him away like it was yesterday
903462 that was it he was gone i was not even allowed a photo of him
903463 it was a fantastic day we had a brilliant time
903464 i found out i was adopted when i was eight years old because my parents thought i was old enough to understand
903465 i never felt any animosity about it i always knew there would be a reason for my adoption

903498 i had a wail of a time when i lost my baggage to my horror the lost suitcase contained my precious golden gown there was no way i could go on stage without wearing that gown so i decided to get a replacement garment
903499 i finally found this place run by a guy called mike at first he was horrified how can i make a duplicate dress without a pattern and that too in just hours but you know me i badgered threatened pleaded it was done i got my golden gown just in time

903510 i was at the oneness meditation camp in chittoor district i had undertaken a maun vrat till the end of this week i did a spiritual course there and returned to mumbai on sunday
903511 the place was so beautiful and calm though its hard for me to keep quiet for more than 10 minutes i found it easy to remain quiet when nature seems to second my tranquil emotion
903512 its a fabulous mind and body healing course when i met the spiritual leader at the oneness university i could feel his divine energy flow from him into me i know it sounds like mumbo jumbo youve to experience it to know how it feels

903536 when g d created the first human beings he led them around the garden of eden and said

903563 id say right now hes ahead of tui hes making more plays and throwing the ball better downfield
903564 were practicing getting another look get a different jersey in here
903565 stuff might happen but you dont want to hurt their guys

903567 we have no idea what theyre trying to do so we have to go out there and try to be sound technically
903568 its always great to go against guys that youre clueless about whats going on
903569 the iphone 3g has been the fastest selling phone ever in the u k but it is too expensive to be a realistic proposition in the pay as you go market
903570 however a cut down version with the candy bar shape of ipod nano music players would be a huge hit as a christmas gift
903571 i have no country to fight for my country is the earth and i am a citizen of the world
903572 im not here to ask for anything today im taking the day off and ive come home a man goes away from home and it is in him to do it he lies in strange beds in the dark and the wind is different in the trees he walks in the street and there are the faces in front of his ey es but there are no names for the faces the voices he hears are not the voices he carried away in his ears a long time back when he went away the voices he hears are loud they are so loud he does not hear for a long time at a stretch those voices he carried away in his ears but there comes a minute when it is quiet and he can hear those voices he carried away in his ears a long time back he can make out what they say and they say come back they say come back boy so he comes back
903573 i get more and more curious about your book do you have a blog entry somewhere back there that talks about what its about what its called and all the rest of that if not do you feel like doing one just to fill me in
903574 not that guys back off in regular practice but you know what youre going to get
903575 a game isnt that way when you go into a game you feel guys out theres the unexpected
903576 practicing against other guys forces you to focus a lot more
903577 but im with a new team right now i dont really care what theyre doing
903578 hes going to be very successful in this league his style will take him a long way
903579 that depends on his relationship with the people on top
903580 last year although we werent as successful as we wanted to be it was the most fun ive had playing in my career
903581 you get used to seeing the same looks every day from our defense
903582 this will be more realistic a good gauge of where were at it will be fun
903583 but we knew if we played our ball we could shut him down but hes a great running back you cant take that away from him
903584 all their running plays were to my side the defensive left side
903585 guys that big are usually just power runners he has power and speed
903586 hes a guy whos versatile and always making big plays
903587 hes one of the best backs i faced in the sec im looking forward to practicing against him and playing against him in the preseason game

903591 nos recuerda constantemente que toda esa obsesiva y subversiva corriente de cine de saldo y subcultura de derribo y su extra a mezcla de belleza y miseria discurre simultanea a lo cotidiano
903592 es curioso que le resalten la calidad cuando la mitad de lo que habla es sobre como la falta de ella crea momentos sublimes

903608 dotar de profesionalidad al sector y que exista un sistema progresi n fundamentado en la formaci n la evaluaci n del desempe o y la experiencia en el puesto
903609 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
903610 spay and neuter will still be a focus here but i enjoy doing other medicine
903611 there are changes and it is expanding so theres some general angst among rescue groups about whats coming
903612 but zareski sees the importance of it he also has great energy and a passion to expand to take what ive done further
903613 there was no policy in place and wed have people showing up with 15 or 20 feral cats when there were already 40 animals in the hospital
903614 thats just not in the best interest of the animals we pride ourselves on evaluating and monitoring every animal
903615 im moving around so sitting down is not something i do a lot of
903616 youll only find me in this office five or six days a month sometimes 10 i travel quite a lot
903617 i spend my time in places like london new york and detroit
903618 we have companies with a creditor matrix of 700 000 people and we have to send to all of them
903619 we look like a dot com company its a very interactive place so we want it to be open and friendly
903620 however as the captain of our marketing team jonathan convinced me that we needed to get our name in front of our contacts and keep it there
903621 when i visit friends and contacts from six years ago i still find the kcc branded basketball hoops on their desks in front of them every day
903622 they are considered to be terrorists in every part of the region
903623 we dont have any information about it we have not heard of this matter
903624 the beijing olympics is facing a terrorist threat unsurpassed in olympic history
903625 if 16 people died i would think that this is the highest casualty ever reported for an incident
903626 je dis ce que je ferai et je ferai ce que jai dit
903627 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
903628 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
903629 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
903630 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
903631 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
903632 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
903633 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
903634 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
903635 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
903636 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
903637 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
903638 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
903639 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
903640 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together

903642 they couldnt go from box cutters one week to weapons grade anthrax the next
903643 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
903644 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean official used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
903645 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
903646 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
903647 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
903648 wat mij betreft gaan we nog zeker veertig jaar door met k3
903649 ik zou me niet kunnen voorstellen dat k3 voortbestaat met een andere rosse blonde of zwarte
903650 er zijn pakjes uit onze beginperiode die ik niet meer zou durven dragen optreden met mijn buik bloot daar pas ik voor

903677 he needs to be confronted about that and a strategy put in place to deal with it
903678 those supporting bailey would have preferred that the probation service sought community support and assistance in dealing with that issue rather than recalling him to prison
903679 it was an overreaction as was the police decision to send 13 police officers and a helicopter to arrest him it has the potential to sour baileys future attitude toward authority
903680 what is now needed is a strategy that encourages and supports his positive behaviour rather than over the top compliance requirements and enforcement he may be high profile but he is not considered by those who know him to be high risk

903916 42 days imprisonment without knowing the charges you face is a draconian measure that both undermines our fundamental freedoms and jeopardises our security but the issue runs far deeper whether it is talking tough on terror the rise of the database state or the growth of a surveillance society the size role and reach of government is now out of control this government increasingly treats our fundamental freedoms with disdain i believe it is time to take a stand

903919 way back when i started this i swore to myself that i would never write about the sickening behaviour of the customers that visit the restaurant that i manage simply because i know that other managers of other restaurants have to deal with fuckers much worse than the ones i get however it seems that in the last month in particular the kinds of lowlifes that i get have evolved into a more pathetic breed it never ceases to amaze me the lengths that people will go to in order to get a discount on their bill dont get me wrong im good at my job so if there is a complaint that is justified it will be dealt with in a more than satisfactory manner on the other side if i rumble you and your bullshit ill not only call you on it but i will make an example of you people think that a manager should grovel in the situation of an unsatisfied customer bollocks thats the kind of thinking that has you lot spoiled in the first place which is why people dont know how to react when a maverick like myself arrives on the scene to show them how they cant get whatever they want just by making up some shitty complaint this installment of assholes guide is dedicated to the worst and most overblown fake and unjustified complaints i have ever received they are all true they all happened its obvious that i sometimes make stuff up for shits and giggles but trust me these all happened ever heard anyone use an allergy to get what they want neither had i until recently hark an actual conversation between me a normal person and a grown adult who obviously doesnt like the word no me hi table for three customer yes please me here i have this table youre in luck its my last one opposite the main entrance to the restaurant customer oh can i have a different one me you can have a different table but you will have to wait maybe thirty minutes this is my last table customer thats fine its just that im allergic to drafts me youre allergic to cold air customer i just dont want that table me having lost all respect instantly for this person fine take a seat at the bar incidentally the same woman asked the staff later on in the evening to have to air conditioning turned on because she was too hot correct me if im wrong and i never am but air conditioning is in fact a poxy fucking draft bint im a restaurant manager not a wine connoisseur i do know the difference between whats hot and whats not in the world of vino even the most ignorant to wine could have seen this next fucker coming me how was everything for you this evening customer everything was fine except for the wine me really what was the problem with the wine customer it was corked me i dont think it was thats pretty impossible actually customer you havent even tried the wine me well first of all you finished the entire bottle so theres nothing for me to try and second of all in order for a wine to be corked there needs to be a cork involved your wine came from a screw top bottle customer oh me so how was everything this evening customer great thanks case closed i rule a hair in the food of a customer is enough to make any manager crawl on hands and knees to make sure the customer not only wont sue but will return to the restaurant which is what i was about to until customer excuse me theres a hair in my food me oh im so sorry this shouldnt have happened let me customer whats wrong me looking at the hair i dont know how to put this so ill just say it customer what me this colour does not match the hair of any of my staff customer how can you be so sure me holding the white hair up to the head of my albino customer its just a hunch in similar instances people have tried to complain that they have found bones in their chicken scales on their fish and skins on their jacket potatoes i shit you not that will pretty much do it for now i feel a lot better having vented all of that into the world who knows maybe one day people will stop acting like knob cheese and just behave like adults i wont hold my breath though tomorrow is another day full of diabetics ordering chocolate fudge cake celiacs who can eat bread if the crust is cut off and people who are allergic to onions in their salads but not in their onion rings
903920 doing the right thing its not like its your money anyways
903921 who knows maybe one day people will stop acting like knob cheese and just behave like adults
903922 certainly sir and shall i bring you the sweet list as well or maybe just one wafer thin mint

903927 hi i am jason the trainee chef i make all the vegetables feck i hate my job but i have to do another five months on my parole otherwise i go back to prison the only thing that keeps me sane is collecting dried dog turds and grating them into the pepper
903928 gday im matt the executive chef from oz i dont really know how to cook but all the bar jobs were gone and i couldnt face working alongside jason so i blagged a work history that no one could be arsed to track down youd think coming from the land of the bbq id know how to grill food but i dont i just keep burning stuff scraping off the black bits and sending it out
903929 alright im dave the head chef stay the f k out of my kitchen and i wont have to cut you right whats on the menu is whats on offer dont try and change it if i came to your place for dinner and you served me up some food youd be pretty f ked off if i asked you to just do the chops a touch more and maybe redo the sauce without garlic so dont do it to me the last guy whos chop was underdone ended up getting some of jasons special seasoning so to recap 1 any part of you that enters the kitchen is fair game to appear on the specials board and 2 be grateful for what you get because trust me if you send it back it will come out worse
903930 my names wee anto so it is like i bring them their dope wahhhhh
903931 any place that has more grease smudges on the menu than ink and then has the audacity to hand you a comment card at the end of a mediocre experience and get defensive at your comments before putting them in the bin and looking for a tip in the same breath
903932 the man who ate the world in search of the perfect dinner
903933 our waiter hubert had made such a meal of selling the pea thing to us i wanted to choose something else to eat just to spite him i mean how good could a pea get it didnt even have a pulse every pea in this pea salad is sliced in half hubert said in a conspiratorial whisper every pea pause in half and do you want to know why they slice every pea in half he leaned closer into maureen as if limbering up to put his hand down the front of her dress now he dropped his voice to an even more breathy whisper double the pleasure
903934 i am really pleased to announce we have decided to change the law so tips received by staff must be paid on top of the national minimum wage not as part of it customers who leave a tip want it to go to staff they dont expect it to be used to subsidise owners paying the minimum wage

903987 the whole notion of an amphibious tall couch trike is the beer induced brain child of a rat patrol member who goes by the name of nancy porker i am simply the conduit between a fantasticly absurd idea which should never have been done and something that now exists and is actually practicle to use in the real world

903989 an essential part of growing up adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
903990 the research shows that children need to experience challenging play in order to develop important life skills and to better manage risk and challenge in their daily lives
903991 however opportunities for children to take such risks are limited this is due to our risk averse culture and an increase in health and safety constraints it is clear that we need to address the current cotton wool culture and to provide children with more opportunities for adventurous play
903992 the costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production
903993 the price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production there will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive
903994 in this context it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process the concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers
903995 there is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly if just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non organic production we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies
903996 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers
903997 it is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and british produce people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade
903998 we normally see a 20 per cent drop in sales in summer which lasts from july to september but now that period is being extended to from june until november

904011 the networks hyperventilating broadcasts of leaked false allegations purportedly tying the anthrax to saddam husseins iraqi regime was bad enough what the organization is doing now is journalistically unforgivable
904012 its imperative for abc to tell us what happened here

904020 the deputy premier and i are here to make a short statement and we will not be taking questions afterwards
904021 i have spoken with a member of paula wriedts family this afternoon and i need to inform the public of recent events
904022 paula was taken to the royal hobart hospital by ambulance a short while ago as the result of an undisclosed medical emergency
904023 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission
904024 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation
904025 it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
904026 she needs to focus on getting well with the support of her family and friends
904027 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
904028 in the interim i will be undertaking her portfolio roles
904029 i have offered paulas family my personal support and that of the government
904030 i will respect their right to make a decision on further comments regarding her condition
904031 i would appeal to the media to show appropriate restraint
904032 my thoughts and those of all government mps are very much with paula love and betrayal

904039 coproxamol wasnt a magic wand but it was the closest thing i had
904040 the truth is that in the uk for the past 10 years or more somewhere between 200 and 300 people have been dying every year from accidental ingestion perhaps from overdose many of them old or confused or vulnerable young people often people who werent actually prescribed the drug at all and thats the target of this change
904041 we have always accepted that some patients will need co proxamol and that is why supplies are being assured
904042 the doctor has to make a judgement that using the drug is in the patients best interests

904056 i think odense are a better team than these are but i am expecting them to be physical as most sides in iceland are we should be happy with the draw and it shouldnt be a problem
904057 they are a very strong team better than odense they are near the top of the norwegian league at this stage it is always good to avoid the strongest team we could meet
904058 ive never heard of them but obviously they must be a decent team to be where they are

904071 it is essential for us to unburden ourselves from the perceptions that have shadowed your outstanding work
904072 we dont flash badges or look for extra perks were not what the media puts across
904073 were respectable people who want to give back to the community
904074 the extra eyes and ears make it probably the safest airport in the country
904075 this undeserved stigma is rooted in the programs past and is no longer accurate however the badges which have become a lightning rod for criticism and mistrust are its most visible legacy and serve to undermine your service and tarnish the reputation of the program

904084 why naturally i look like a boy for that is what i am with us what you call time is a spacious thing it takes a long stretch of it to grow an angel to full age
904085 i am sixteen thousand years old counting as you count
904086 no the fall did not affect me nor the rest of the relationship
904087 we cannot do wrong neither have we any disposition to do it for we do not know what it is

904119 the payment system really allows for entrepreneurial initiative to go out and provide a service with the assurance that they will be compensated for whatever they do because of that we have more than 600 approved collectors and 60 approved recyclers throughout the state
904120 visible to the consumer and delivers a strong educational message that the consumer has a role to play in recycling used products and that recycling programs are available
904121 because such an approach has been shown to not accomplish its goals is administratively burdensome for all parties and will only guarantee a new revenue source for government without guaranteeing that an effective recycling system will be put into place
904122 our economy is in a very difficult state right now consumers and retailers are suffering to mandate inflation to require higher prices is not productive for the economy it hurts consumers retailers and manufacturers
904123 what we would like to see rather than this negative spiral is a virtuous cycle where good products are coming into the market flexible ways to recycle and reuse products are being pursued and you have an affordable way for customers to enjoy the benefits of modern life
904124 the right way to approach this rather than a patch quilt way is a national statute that promotes a producer responsibility model

904131 the most exciting part of my job is talking to consumers about how they feel about us launching green works there are quite a few people who have thanked us for being forward thinking and being the first to really step out and do this it is an under served consumer group who have been wanting this
904132 there were a lot of barriers but we decided we could do it we have the scale to make these products affordable and accessible to the public
904133 i think where we compared to our peers are most focused on reducing our footprint and helping consumers reduce theirs

904137 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
904138 south korea is a leading testbed for the it industry and the internet media here certainly has a frontier like aspect in leading experimental democracy but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information
904139 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
904140 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole

904155 this is quite an urgent issue emissions from cars are increasing people are buying cars all the time
904156 we dont want them to stop driving but we want to them choose the greenest car
904157 they need the biggest possible incentive thats why the government should be even bolder really penal rates for high emission cars and really attractive carrots so that tax is almost nothing on the greenest models
904158 according to the governments own figures these changes will only have a very limited impact on the environment
904159 the treasury must be more ambitious matching increased charges on high carbon cars with discounts or rebates on low emissions vehicles
904160 green taxes are supposed to be about changing future behaviour but this measure penalises car owners for past decisions
904161 the public must have faith that green taxes are not about raising revenue for the treasury but in this case their use is clearly more to do with filling alistair darlings coffers than cutting carbon emissions from our roads
904162 we set out the position very clearly in the budget rates for pre 2001 cars will continue to be based on engine size
904163 taking account of inflation drivers of these cars will still pay less than in 1997 and some will see a decrease in inflation terms
904164 in the budget it was shown as a policy to change peoples behaviour how can you change someones decision made in 2001

904181 if youre an artist you can paint you can let your mind wander
904182 it doesnt really seem necessary to have people be in an institution to learn
904183 i think libraries are about a zillion times more important than schools
904184 you sound like youre talking about learning about one specific thing thats not really what we do
904185 one day were traveling up to the city san francisco and berkeley to get together with other unschoolers another day were over chopping wood at the boys grandparents house so we have fire our days really go wherever the interest is and whatevers on our schedule
904186 the thing is that we dont create it as this big subject
904187 its not this big scary thing its just part of our day
904188 its been really interesting because it just confirms what ive felt all along anything is an avenue to learning anything that engages you teaches you something
904189 im pretty sure my little brother learned math watching television
904190 so much of the focus on schooling is academic information ive come to understand that yes all thats good but the critical thing is that you know how to learn how to think how to communicate
904191 every once in awhile i get a bug in my head saying gosh i dont think i know that this is out there in the world
904192 i started telling them about math and they didnt really care pushing that kind of stuff is what gives people that resistance
904193 the family for me is a stand in of a social unit that can collaborate together
904194 some kind of exquisite mix happens between what people already know and the activity theyre learning what kind of knowledge does the family build collaboratively its always the case that they know more together than alone
904195 the notion that learning should somehow follow human nature has been around since the time of rousseau
904196 the school system that we have now was invented in the late 19th century and had very explicit models factories railroads and the army
904197 so they took features from each of those areas and created a school system the school was designed to basically rank and sort people into the economic social ideological order
904198 before there was all this standardized curriculum and testing all that began in the late 19th century there was no such thing as school failure
904199 its the system that produces winners losers those who pass those who fail those who count as somebody and those who count as nobody
904200 i think schools have become so tightly connected to economic political and social opportunities and because of that people arent willing to abandon the standard model
904201 people are trying to find a way to have schools be of good quality and give people real opportunities but without hurting people along the way
904202 if the kids decide that they want to go to college theyll get themselves ready for it
904203 what ive also seen is people growing up this way and saying you know this isnt what i want its more about finding something thats meaningful to them and meaningful to the world they dont care as much about the trappings of societal definitions of success
904204 you can just learn and figure things out your own way
904205 hamburguesas son llenas de grasa y no son ricas en sustancias nutritivitas
904206 the most important thing any teacher has to learn not to be learned in any school of education i ever heard of can be expressed in seven words learning is not the product of teaching learning is the product of the activity of learners
904207 the anxiety children feel at constantly being tested their fear of failure punishment and disgrace severely reduces their ability both to perceive and to remember and drives them away from the material being studied into strategies for fooling teachers into thinking they know what they really dont know
904208 its not that i feel that school is a good idea gone wrong but a wrong idea from the word go its a nutty notion that we can have a place where nothing but learning happens cut off from the rest of life
904209 the true test of intelligence is not how much we know how to do but how to behave when we dont know what to do
904210 to parents i say above all else dont let your home become some terrible miniature copy of the school no lesson plans no quizzes no tests no report cards even leaving your kids alone would be better at least they could figure out some things on their own live together as well as you can enjoy life together as much as you can
904211 children do not need to be made to learn to be better told what to door shown how if they are given access to enough of the world they will see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to others and they will make for themselves a better path into that world then anyone else could make for them
904212 true learning learning that is permanent and useful that leads to intelligent action and further learning can arise only out of the experience interest and concerns of the learner
904213 it is as true now as it was then that no matter what tests show very little of what is taught in school is learned very little of what is learned is remembered and very little of what is remembered is used the things we learn remember and use are the things we seek out or meet in the daily serious nonschool parts of our lives
904214 what children need is not new and better curricula but access to more and more of the real world plenty of time and space to think over their experiences and to use fantasy and play to make meaning out of them and advice road maps guidebooks to make it easier for them to get where they want to go not where we think they ought to go and to find out what they want to find out

904217 the youtube contest was a blast i really enjoyed putting my video together and think it turned out great
904218 i hope my video and the contest itself opens the publics eyes to homeschooling and shows that homeschooling really is cool
904219 i thought all of the kids did a fantastic job showing why they think homeschool is cool these students are definitely creative and enjoy the freedom that homeschool allows
904220 the freedom to learn was a resounding message the students portrayed in their videos
904221 this youtube contest gave homeschoolers everywhere the opportunity to tell their unique story and show people why homeschooling is a creative exciting and realistic alternative to traditional education
904222 were so pleased with all the entries and would like to thank all the students who participated

904230 your child ren has probably their natural desire to learn squashed and will need time to recover from that with a parents help they can gain back most if not all of what they lost and begin to see the world as a place where learning is enjoyable and all around us

904232 since the girl scout organization makes no attempt to interpret or define the word god but encourages members to establish for themselves the nature of their spiritual beliefs it is the policy of the girl scouts of the u s a that individuals when making the girl scout promise may substitute wording appropriate to their own spiritual beliefs for the word god
904233 the girl scout organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief our movement is secular and is founded on american democratic principles one of which is freedom of religion

904238 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments
904239 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
904240 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
904241 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
904242 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
904243 would be able to know that you have a very high near intractable cholesterol problem
904244 though most people tell the truth most of the time there are people out there who dont who leave out something thats incredibly relevant who may even be able to defraud a company
904245 thats important because ultimately the people who tell the truth have to pay for those who dont
904246 i had a patient on amitriptyline for migraines and they were denied life insurance because its also an antidepressant
904247 i had to explain it wasnt being used for depression
904248 i wrote an appeal letter and they still wouldnt give it to her
904249 weve got to stop these practices before the marketplace is fully developed and patients lose all control over their medical information
904250 a lot of insurance companies are starting to use this type of data
904251 they said all right prescription data is working lets go and look at other types of data too its because of the success of one that were going after others
904252 the message that it is okay to ignore the law
904253 but consumers will likely continue to have no real meaningful choices if they want insurance
904254 ooh this is a 60 minutes story in the making generally they wanted to make it a super secret database restricted to underwriting
904255 theres a huge case for it being opened up for all legitimate access
904256 a lot of issues that have long confronted low wage workers are now increasingly facing middle income workers
904257 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
904258 our company doesnt provide medical insurance i have to provide my own and i cannot find any that i can afford
904259 as far as having a full blown checkup i have not had one in probably 10 to 15 years
904260 weve had to cut back on things like going out to eat and shopping to make sure we have the necessities

904262 i might have to be forced to move back to texas
904263 because i wont be able to afford to live in florida

904267 its still attainable just a little bit harder now at this time in the economy
904268 but yeah everybody wants to be able to have their own house and family and be able to pay their bills and have a little extra money and you can still do it
904269 hes a stabilizing force and he is a savvy veteran
904270 you dont see the fallout in terms of physical play

904273 having a chance to win a championship is something that is very important to me
904274 i think this group of guys and the coaching staff dont create that environment
904275 i would say you could get lured into that but i think they have high expectations for themselves the coaches and players
904276 you got to have those but you still have to be able to be loose go out and play football and not press you cant be a robot
904277 he says he is re energized and im glad to hear that

904282 we like our group of guys and we are going to go with what weve got
904283 i know he is making progress and he is on schedule
904284 darren proved to me in the last seven or eight games last season that he can be a guy that can have an impact on the game and can have an impact on every game
904285 thats our job as coaches to do that you give him the opportunity and its not going to happen every week but he certainly is a guy that can change games

904299 i dont think the morale aspect has got anything to do with it it was a friendly game and i dont think the morale will be a problem the problem is getting back to a level of play that will allow us to compete in a better manner its just a fact we have to face that we are not reaching the same level as we did in the early part of last season

904344 our teachers are our coaches and there are no football goal posts or nets
904345 at school we used to have only a period per week for sports as they call it but in fact there was only football
904346 i went to a public high school where we used to play football and sometimes volleyball at the university we dont do any kind of sports
904347 so i joined the armed forces officers club to go swimming i usually play football on the street in our neighborhood
904348 since we come from the far corners of sanaa we face harassment on the street and providing the club with a bus could solve this problem and prevent families from worrying about their daughters
904349 there is an opportunity for people to have a one day entry to the club and enjoy the best sports facilities at armed forces officers club
904350 one of our plans is to establish a special section for families

904434 we have a good understanding of what the universe looked like shortly after it originated about 14 billion years ago we also have a good idea of what the universe looks like now
904435 but theres a significant gap in our understanding of how the universe made this transition from what it looked like after the big bang to how it appears to us today

904454 its starting to look like what the company promised us is coming to fruition
904455 you dont know when theyre going to go out of style
904456 people get way too wrapped up in a charts past
904457 thats pretty irrelevant to what will happen in the future what really matters is the health of the company
904458 sometimes they find nothing but cause great havoc to the sites because of the digs
904459 no changes have occurred and weve taken no exceptional precautions
904460 total already has returned 30 children of its employees to france as a precaution to secure the families
904461 theres been no change in security procedures following the french warning
904462 this warning hasnt affected the spirit of the companys french employees as not one has requested to travel to france
904463 security forces have increased their readiness to protect all foreign interests and citizens in yemen and repel any acts of sabotage
904464 terrorism exempts no country and all efforts should come together in order to fight it
904465 internal factors on the ground played a key role in ending the fighting which is notable when looking at the yemeni armys unsatisfactory performance during the most recent clashes
904466 wise and judicious our side welcomes this decision and we believe that ending this war is a triumph for yemen and all yemeni people
904467 realizing his national responsibility as president of this nation president saleh decided to cease military operations against saada because he also understands that such fighting favors neither the nation nor the government nor does it help maintain national security and stability
904468 in addition to information about marketing and administration matters the practical training was very useful for us
904469 university graduates who cant find jobs should take the opportunity to start small enterprises instead of waiting for employment

904471 it was a good opportunity for small business owners and youths to meet representatives from smeps gtz and tadhamon islamic bank since all are concerned about such projects

904480 son it really depends on how much conscientiousness one has you see people of true and sincere faith in god already have it made as to how to worship god and more importantly how to deal with the day to day chores of living god must be more than just someone we bow and pray to or write notes to god is more than some being we claim to call on us in our sleep and ask us to deliver mankind god is certainly not some deity who demands of us to blow half the world in his name as some of our misguided wahhabi so called jihadists contend all of these nincompoops are not doing god any favors by claiming to correspond with him each in his own way
904481 but son dont you think the israelis have those nukes to face the arabs who are waiting for the first opportunity to annihilate the jewish state which was imposed upon this region by a misguided international community unable to tell right from wrong
904482 mother you see all of these people are just messing around with religion to suit their own mundane aspirations the zionists have pulled a big number by claiming that god would truly sanction real estate to trespassers who do not have the least legitimate proof of ownership of the holy land which was ordained by god for all his truly god fearing believers of all faiths and which has been inhabited by the palestinians for millennia we all know god to be just and merciful and certainly would not allow for an injustice to be meted out in his name the neo christians are seeking some spiritual comfort for relief from an extremely non altruistic culture that has overtaken one of the most beautiful regions of the world ever since the white man first set foot on massachusetts bay there are different explanations of how the christians could come up with the idea of obliterating the jews but the zionists think their stockpile of nukes will avoid that so they believe that letting the neo christians think like that suits their purposes well for now they may actually be encouraging people like george bush and dick cheney to think that this is godsent christian belief then we have our lunatic wahhabi suicide legions that have been scientifically reared to disguise themselves as the angel of death and just blow up anything that moves believing this to be the pathway to paradise nothing is further than the truth these loonies are buying a one way ticket to eternal hell for having distorted islam beyond recognition and caused most of the havoc that is shaking the world today they even established an unusually powerful clergy which is anathema to islamic belief since allah forbids the emergence of a clergy as a medium between man and god yet thanks to the trillions of petrodollars they have access to they have managed to spread this heretical sect of islam to the far corners of the world expending around us 200 billion over the last three decades alone i am not sure which is more dangerous to the moslem nation or ummah but if you ask me i think that the last of the three is a fifth column we really have to keep our eyes open to they have seriously damaged the image and the position of islam as a leading sensible and down to earth simple faith

904492 after the show wrapped up salman went up to ranbir hugged him and presented him with a portrait of raj kapoor people who saw it were very impressed it was an exact impression of raj kapoor in profile salman must have seen photographs and painted him ranbir was so touched that he had tears in his eyes and hugged salman
904493 after the show ended ranbir showed it to his grandmother krishna for whom it was an extremely emotional moment she has hung up the portrait on a wall of the rk studios office
904494 the best way to find out what happened is to watch the show on august 15

904543 the people who post on these sites have become accustomed to behaving like beasts because they can because no one is really monitoring them
904544 e mail is used as a self validation tool by people to procrastinate and to re create activity versus productivity
904545 if its a multi party case it may generate maybe 20 e mails from other people
904546 so as youre trying to focus on it youre getting this ping ping ping as people are chattering about the e mail
904547 see you cant do it because you dont know what youre doing
904548 how can we get these people the time they need to do the hard work necessary to take it to the next level

904555 moscow is seriously concerned with the escalation of tension in the region caused by disproportionate use of force by the georgian side

904563 some of the other competitors are going to feel that theyre getting long in the tooth looking quite dated because they havent created that ten year vision from a horsepower standpoint
904564 i think the notion of that controller is a non trivial point that youve brought up that control and that familiarity is like comfort food from my perspective we lead we dont follow

904578 we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
904579 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back

904581 china is a future colonial power in africa and it makes sense for south africa to seek favour now
904582 this is really the only alternative for south africa seeing as it regards the usa as an enemy and europe as an officious entity in africa
904583 reliable air transportation for both cargo and civilians is a critical component of developing helmand provinces economy
904584 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
904585 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
904586 essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response however it appears that apple forgot something the client libaries on my osx 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomize the source port

904596 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality
904597 theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
904598 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than la or atlanta
904599 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
904600 it the lineout effort is not one that we will reflect on with a lot of pride
904601 a bit of a reality check might be good for the guys
904602 it will make us work even though the work ethic is already very good with this team it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and we need that heading to south africa
904603 but we know were only at the half way mark of the tri nations and you dont have time to dwell on any losses you just look at the kiwis a week is a long time and you can turn things around quickly
904604 not starting well hurt us in the end but when we scored just before half time we got that confidence back we were then telling each other we were right back in the match we felt if we played smart and got down there we were a chance by trying to build the points however the all blacks kept dominating field position and it was hard to really attack
904605 pinning us down in our own half whereas last week we were able to turn those high kicks and dominate field position a bit more
904606 i still feel we had the right game plan to beat the all blacks but we just werent able to execute it
904607 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured

904646 we fear these men who are behind so much violence in narathiwat yala and pattani will influence malaysians to join their fight
904647 they will do their best to recruit more people and the easiest targets are students
904648 these suspected militants would normally hide in rubber estates and isolated villages
904649 some have bomb making skills while the rest know how to use firearms as well as other weapons
904650 we believe these men are making home made bombs and testing them at camps in malaysia
904651 we got a tip off that at least six bombs exploded during a training exercise at camps in kelantan but no one was injured
904652 we are going to do very well next year this malaysia is a growth market one which is not many in the world the premium segment is growing here

904665 there is growing concern at garda overtime costs as the need for financial restraints is evident
904666 at a time when gardai are targeting organised crime through operations like anvil which accounts for the largest subhead for overtime payments the policing operation at rossport continues to devour valuable resources
904667 that current price is 11m and rising money which could be re routed to frontline crime fighting

904713 we do not rule out introducing presumed consent in wales at some point in the future
904714 however we do not believe that it is currently the most urgent priority and believe that it could be a distraction from other more productive actions
904715 asking grieving people for their consent to remove part of their loved ones even if it is to save the life of another is not an easy task
904716 so i can see the attraction of presumed consent unfortunately whatever its attractions its not a silver bullet
904717 we feel the committee has missed a real opportunity for wales to take the lead and send a clear message to the rest of the uk that a soft system of presumed consent would increase donation rates and save welsh lives
904718 quite simply people are dying on these waiting lists we have the opportunity to change that by simply changing our approach
904719 there is no doubt that a system of presumed consent would produce a far higher potential donor rate than at present which is far too low at 22

904725 i believe president calderons actions earlier today came in no small measure thanks to the ongoing advocacy efforts of a growing group of dedicated activists in mexico who have been pushing the government and industry on this issue we salute president calderon for his forward thinking action which should dramatically improve and save the lives of countless mexicans it was the right thing for president calderon to do with or without the pressure from activists he did it and we thank him for overturning this outdated requirement

904728 people are looking to cloud computing for answers to ultimate application scalability but the true limits of these systems are not yet known today we have achieved something significant we proved that if the application itself is perfectly scalable then with the right choice of middleware technology and the right choice of a cloud platform you can achieve a perfect linear scaling up to at least 512 nodes amazon ec2 and gridgain can get you there today

904766 nella tappa di coppa del mondo a san pietroburgo aveva la possibilit di perdere un assalto e garantirsi un tabellone migliore allolimpiade ma lui ha vinto lo stesso anche se voleva dire incontrare avversari pi forti a pechino perch crede nello sport perch una persona leale altri al suo posto hanno perso
904767 la mia prima reazione stata questa mi sono messo a piangere non ci potevo credere non perch pensavo a un suo possibile errore ma perch ho capito subito che qualcuno laveva incastrato andrea uno preciso lo so bene perch spesso sono il suo compagno di camera
904768 s mi ricordo benissimo quando ha dovuto prendere lantibiotico per linfezione a un dito del piede
904769 di sicuro so che se qualcuno ha cercato di mettergli qualcosa nellacqua durante la finale ha messo in pericolo anche noi perch da quelle bottiglie che stanno nel box durante la prova a squadre bevono tutti difficile dire qual la mia bottiglia e quella di un compagno e quindi quel qualcosa lho preso anchio oppure ho rischiato di prenderlo anchio ma la cosa che mi d pi fastidio che ora baldini sia qui a doversi difendere da qualcosa che non ha commesso invece di essere a pechino per prendersi una medaglia
904770 s certamente lo sapeva so che tanti nellambiente pensano sia stato lui io dico che non ci posso credere
904771 veniamo paragonati a chi prende sostanze illecite che neanche conosciamo ma solo perch tanti non sanno che cos il nostro sport perch nella scherma non serve essere pi forti o pi veloci o pi qualsiasi cosa e una combinazione di tante capacit che ti portano a toccare prima lavversario
904772 la sera dopo la finale eravamo al ristorante e lui a un certo punto sbiancato ed andato in bagno a vomitare ma gi nella finale era strano
904773 era moscio fisicamente per niente reattivo lui solitamente in pedana un gatto invece zero se nera accorto anche il suo maestro paolo paoletti tanto che quando ci siamo ritrovati la settimana dopo in collegiale a tirrenia ha chiesto che gli facessero dei test medici perch laveva visto male

904983 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
904984 the phrase 100 year flood doesnt communicate to the public or to policymakers the real risk of flooding they think it means a flood that occurs once every 100 years when in fact theres something like a 60 percent chance of experiencing it in your lifetime
904985 la perdita della pressione alla gomma di hamilton ancora soggetto di indagine non ci sono al momento certezze assolute ma un taglio nella spalla sembra la spiegazione pi attendibile
904986 avevamo caricato p benzina al primo pit stop per cui potevamo fare pi giri di massa e tentare di recuperare su di lui

904988 chi meglio di me in formula 1 solo alonso e raikkonen
904989 all knowledge is subjective all evidence interpretive it could be this or that no way to know all standards of logical are arbitrary
904990 science from the latin scientia knowledge in the broadest sense refers to any systematic knowledge or practice
904991 the repulsive cartoons depicting the prophet have violated the sanctity of 1 5 billion muslims around the world and their feelings this has exposed those who are actually promoting extremism violence and hatred between peoples
904992 we must seize this opportunity to spread the correct perspective of his noble life through publications and programs in various languages
904993 everyone has an opion about everything if a person starts with the belief that there is no god and looks at evidence such as fossils that person will conlcude that evoluion is true however if a person is open to the possiblity of god and looks at fossils they will conclude special creation is true
904994 you can not know for sure that a thing does not exist anywhere because you have not been everywhere and you do not know everything
904995 after the flood the continents moved apart very quickly in time the continents slowed down
904996 we do not know a millionth of one percent about anything
904997 the generation of living from nonliving matter it is taken from the belief now abandoned that organisms found in putrid organic matter arose spontaneously from it
904998 first place dirty damp rags in a corner leave alone for a while and the rags will create rats
904999 one has only to contemplate the magnitude of this task to concede that the spontaneous generation of a living organism is impossible yet here we are as a result i believe of spontaneous generation
905000 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
905001 from the probability standpoint the ordering of the present environment into a single amino acid molecule would be utterly improbable in all the time and space available for the origin of terrestrial life
905002 the amount of matter to be shaken together to produce a single molecule of protein would be millions of times greater than that in the whole universe for it to occur on earth alone would require many almost endless billions of years
905003 yet it must not be forgotten that mutation is the ultimate source of all genetic variation found in natural populations and the only raw material available for natural selection to work on
905004 the great majority of mutant genes are harmful in their effect on the organism
905005 obviously such a process has played no part whatever in evolution
905006 there are two or three million species on earth a sufficient field one might think for observation but it must be said today that in spite of all the evidence of trained observers not one change of the species to another is on record
905007 to the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the cambrian system i can give no satisfactory answer the case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained
905008 one of the major unsolved problems of geology and evolution
905009 strange as it may seem mollusks were mollusks just as unmistakably as they are now
905010 why should such complex organic forms be in rocks about 600 million years old and be absent or unrecognized in the records of the preceding two billion years if there has been evolution of life the absence of the requisite fossils in the rocks older than cambrian is puzzling
905011 the sudden appearance of life is not only the most puzzling feature of the whole fossil record but also its greatest apparent inadequacy
905012 the same day were all th fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
905013 so far as we know natural selection is the only effective agency of evolution
905014 natural selection is no longer regarded as an all or none process but rather as a purely statistical concept
905015 search for the cause of evolution has been abandoned it is now clear that evolution has no single cause
905016 it might be argued that the theory is quite unsubstantiated and has status only as a speculation
905017 on the basis of our present knowledge natural selection is bound to produce genetic adaptations and genetic adaptations are thus presumptive evidence for the efficiency of natural selection
905018 to sum up natural selection converts randomness into direction and blind chance into apparent purpose it operates with the aid of time to produce improvements in the machinery of living and in the process generates results of a more than astronomical improbability which could have been achieved in no other way
905019 the figure 1 with three million naughts after it and that would take three large volumes of about 500 pages each just to print no one would bet on anything so improbable happening and yet it has happened
905020 and let us remind you who find such odds ridiculous even if you are reassured by mr
905021 add them all in and you long ago stopped talking about rational thought much less scientific evidence
905022 it is time all this nonsense ceased it is time to bury the corpse it is time to shift the books to the humor ous fiction section of the libraries
905023 cleaned up my butthole real good so there werent no shit left up in there

905034 soldados estadounidenses destinados en bosnia en 1996 y 1997 recibieron rdenes por escrito por las cuales no deb an detener a los pr fugos m s buscados en caso de que los localizasen
905035 ste es un asunto viejo que karadzic comenz en 1996 declar el pasado viernes
905036 y para explicarlo a su propia gente se invent entonces esta historia que ha adornado durante doce a os pero no hay ninguna verdad en ello
905037 en un cien por ciento que una de las prioridades del gobierno de estados unidos era transferir a la haya a los sospechosos de cr menes de guerra en primer lugar karadzic y ratko mladic
905038 la historia sobre el acuerdo con holbrooke es un viejo clich desgastado del que s lo puedo re rme
905039 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
905040 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
905041 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory

905044 ya no sabe que hacer con seis hermanos porque mi pap se fue para el otro lado y nunca regres se enojaba hasta porque le ped amos de comer y nos golpeaba mucho por eso yo mejor me vine para ac con unos t os que no me aguantaron en su casa por eso llegu a la calle aqu la vida es bien dura pero sin tantos golpes
905045 cada quien agarra su rumbo y aunque mi mam lo sabe no nos rega a porque lo que sacamos limpiando vidrios o haciendo mandados es para comprar lo que nosotros necesitamos o para el mandado
905046 when i start to explain that to you youll be messing with my speech so you know i can only say that mr d eddie d hes instrumental in my life in more ways than one some ways probably more than mr d even knows himself
905047 but he gave me a lot of inspiration and so did coach walsh to me it was one of the lower moments in my life i was kind of depressed because i was leaving the chargers coach bill walsh he brought me in mr eddie he accepted me you know theres so much inside of me that its really difficult for me to explain right now
905048 the pressure he could apply from the outside and the push we got on the inside really people forget how good of a defense it was
905049 he was the freak before the freak he was like jevon kearse in that he wasnt especially big he was barely bigger than a linebacker at that i probably weighed more than him fred was quick and he was strong he had natural strength
905050 being paid less than a truck driver at that time you know that makes a difference in life for me when my brother in law would tell me hey i make that much driving a truck you know things like that
905051 when he was traded in 81 that really changed things for our defense it put a lot more strain on the front and the linebackers it affected our effectiveness
905052 obviously he had great success in san francisco im happy for him
905053 i actually stepped on the other side for a minute breathed in the air looked at it as a rainbow i made it to the other side of the rainbow for me that was the pot of gold it was a different lifestyle for me altogether i felt free to perform once i got there
905054 at that time they were playing the dallas cowboys bill walsh told me they hadnt beat em in a while it was in the paper and everything about how they had not for me it was a platform for me to prove a point that i still had it and could do it
905055 i started for the chargers was a down lineman played every down with coach walsh he said im going to use you sparingly for rushing the passer he said he didnt know what my condition was
905056 the first game he said id only play like 10 or 12 plays
905057 yes i take a great deal of pride in that because you know to be the person that does something regardless of what it is if its anything out of the ordinary it makes you real good it makes you proud of it
905058 i died for beauty and was scarce adjusted in the tomb when one who died for truth was lain in an adjoining room
905059 whats the difference if were a 380 team or a 350 team we stink either way
905060 so thats a method i use a lot ill put my mind set back here and picture myself training when im actually competing it helps me relax
905061 its almost like anyone can win a medal its very easy to lose the focus in the pressure situation you can be strong physically technically shooting good shots but if you lose the focus thats it game over
905062 some people might get psyched up to think about their competitor but for me i need to keep it more as a personal competition
905063 its just you your bow the target thats the best way to approach it
905064 what we work on is same movement same motion same thought process
905065 because when you make it in your career it kind of takes away the joy of winning it makes it almost like i have to win and my focus was the winning as opposed to enjoying what i did
905066 i didnt feel i was shooting well and i was thinking am i done
905067 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
905068 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
905069 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
905070 we get mad at each other we walk away and then calmer heads prevail
905071 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
905072 bobs the smartest guy in the world we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
905073 we scored a goal and that should be enough to get a result get a win at least a draw its something we have to hold ourselves accountable for
905074 you have an english team get behind the ball its boring to watch if a team goes out home or away they want to see a good honest team who wants to go out and win the game
905075 the last time i win the dicks sporting goods championship on july 6 in endicott n y the school is closed in my little village when i arrive to the airport all of the kids go to follow me and my car
905076 now i win the u s senior open maybe the president come to visit me maybe i dont think so
905077 i thought i could get it somewhere near the green i thought wrong
905078 you have to have a clear mind to putt these greens and i wasnt very clear
905079 the toughest set of greens ive seen in a major championship bar none
905080 the first thing i do when i get out of bed in the morning is turn on the music
905081 before i go to bed i turn on the music it affects the way i view the world it affects my hopes and aspirations about what i want to do in my life
905082 i think at first appearance people may not take him seriously just because theyre thinking thats another athlete that thinks he can rap or sing
905083 nate from the beginning had a knack for expressing himself musically he had a really beautiful voice from the time he could talk
905084 jack nasty came to me and i know it conjures up strange images in ones head
905085 its really nothing dirty or strange its a name that rolls off the tongue an alter ego when i get on stage and rock the mike
905086 a lot of rappers these days are not really talking about anything socially conscious
905087 theyre talking about image money and women thats not what im about
905088 he has an outlet for the things he enjoys besides football
905089 he doesnt have too much presence over my other choices but he is talented
905090 training camp comes around i just kind of start from square one every year
905091 it really takes for football to be over to go on to the next chapter to be able to do my best stuff
905092 im frustrated i really felt my game was there i really felt like i hit some quality shots in the last three weeks and you know we can all say the golfing gods arent on your side when you dont win
905093 greg and i talked a lot this week about the effects of the altitude in colorado on the tennis and golf games i think it really helps the golfers and hurts the tennis players
905094 hes played wonderful golf its been amazing i couldnt do what hes done i wouldnt even try
905095 im not mentally or physically tired i just played three weeks in a row and didnt schedule any more than this
905096 no more golf until the merrill lynch shark shootout his tournament dec 10 14 in naples fla
905097 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking

905102 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
905103 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known

905106 subscriber focused email marketing programs that give readers more control in what they receive
905107 we must go deeper into how we use e mail to see why meaningful choice has to be the standard now
905108 if you dont want to get email dont send email
905109 a company must strive to strip back as many barriers and layers as possible to allow people to actually get in contact with a real person at the company every email sent from a company even a transactional email should allow for two way communication

905125 you boy you applied for a job hmm i know but you didnt get it i also know that
905126 swami since you knew why did you not see to it that he got the job laughter why do you say that he didnt get the job
905127 if you are hungry is it enough if your mother eats on your behalf if your leg is broken your mother cant have bandages no you have to put on bandages for yourself so each one has to work for ones own liberation for ones own salvation for ones own moksha we cannot ask somebody else to do it on our behalf
905128 in our model the mice showed tibial bowing similar to that observed in nf1 patients however since mouse legs are not subjected to the same excessive mechanical forces as humans we also applied a bone injury model
905129 this enables analysis of the complex process of bone repair while at the same time causing the least possible distress to the animals
905130 lovastatin appears to accelerate cortical bone repair primarily by enhancing new bone formation within the bone marrow cavity and by replacing fibro cartilaginous tissue in the injury site with mineralised bone matrix
905131 our results suggest the usefulness of lovastatin a drug approved in 1987 for the treatment of high cholesterol in the treatment of neurofibromatosis related fracture healing abnormalities
905132 get up off your sorry ass and start living forget everything youve been through and start right now today it took x number of years to get yourself in this mess do you think change will happen overnight do what you can do today

905134 like sands through the hourglass so are the days of our lives
905135 there are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth not going all the way and not starting
905136 this is the first drug in a new class of antiretroviral drugs called integrase inhibitors the drug has a different mechanism of action is very potent seems very safe and has helped patients who have a virus that is resistant to older drugs and classes
905137 it initially will be used in developed countries but hopefully it will be made available at cheaper prices for patients in developing countries who are facing the same problems

905141 when one of these rare genetic variations is present in a person the result is a moderate to large increase in disease risk
905142 persons affected with the illness however may exhibit changes in thought and behaviour hallucinations or delusions are only a few of the potential symptoms of this severe mental illness
905143 there are presumably several genetic factors working together each of which only has a very small effect on disease risk or which occur very rarely and have a moderate to strong effect
905144 for this reason the field of schizophrenia genetics should be concerned with identifying these so called risk genes
905145 altogether a great number of institutes took part in both studies
905146 in our experiments concepts presented early in a poem or prose passage were more available when alliterative sounds overlapped between lines than when there was no overlap
905147 using novel techniques we have identified a key membrane protein thats essential to the defense that m tuberculosis mounts against the acidic environment of immune cells called macrophages
905148 m tuberculosis does not depend on rv3671c under standard growth conditions in the test tube so it has been overlooked as a candidate drug target
905149 however when m tuberculosis infects the host then the rv3671c protein becomes essential
905150 this is an example of a new class of potential targets for anti infective agents
905151 those that the pathogen only needs in order to survive in the host environment
905152 as part of this process the phagosome becomes acidic which is thought to contribute to its ability to break down and destroy the pathogen
905153 however m tuberculosis appears to survive the acidification process keeping its own internal ph stable
905154 what we observed was pretty amazing without functioning rv3671c the mutant bacterium was easily destroyed in a low ph environment both in culture and inside the more acidic environment of the macrophage this revealed a new point of vulnerability for the bacterium
905155 we are very excited because it appears the oral vaccine is even more effective than traditional injectable vaccine this could really make a difference
905156 it worked beautifully its expensive to create an injectible vaccine but with oral vaccines it is quite cheap you grow your plants and then you convert them into capsules

905160 im a firm believer that 90 of the fate of an email program is decided at the point of data collection whether its how you collected the data the notice and choice you gave the customer when collecting that data the expectations you set when you collected that data thats 90 right there

905178 most on air statements during that time could not be classified as positive or negative lichter said the study found on average less than two opinion statements per night on the candidates on all three networks combined not exactly embracing or pummeling obama or mccain but when a point of view did emerge it tended to tilt against obama
905179 that was a reversal of the trend during the primaries when the same researchers found that 64 of statements about obama new to the political spotlight were positive but just 43 of statements about mccain were positive
905180 this is a study that is bound to have some serious consequences for american journalism in large measure because of one aspect of the poll the political leanings of the journalists who responded to the survey
905181 it found that a majority of american journalists say they are liberals not surprisingly this has been grist for conservatives because it confirms the impression that journalists are overwhelmingly liberal compared to the public in general
905182 more importantly in my opinion the poll never asks about the political leanings of the media owners publishers and upper management of news organizations it is arguable that their politics are more influential than their employees in choosing the direction of a news organization
905183 climbing fansipan is the most appealing and adventurous tourist attraction in viet nam because you can really enjoy nature there
905184 you can admire the beautiful mountains with forests and flowers all around and get a chance to challenge yourself physically by climbing the heights its a really powerful experience
905185 to make the trip successful apart from strong determination and a good backpack climbers must also check their stamina this means they should practise by climbing other smaller mountains such as ba vi or tam dao

905203 common challenges facing the two countries in terms of dealing with terrorism and militancy
905204 both sides agreed that there was a need for the two governments to engage on all issues across the board with a view to developing a common strategy to overcome the challenges posed to the security and stability of both countries by terrorism and extremism the two sides agreed to coordinate their efforts to stop cross border terrorism

905210 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
905211 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
905212 i was dismayed to discover that the ipccs 2001 and 2007 reports did not devote chapters to the central climate sensitivity question and did not explain in proper systematic detail the methods by which they evaluated it when i began to investigate it seemed that the ipcc was deliberately concealing and obscuring its method
905213 most articles on climate sensitivity conclude as i have done that climate sensitivity must be harmlessly low

905215 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
905216 the american physical society an organization representing nearly 50 000 physicists has reversed its stance on climate change
905217 and here is a rocket scientist from australia who has also decided that co2 and agw are no longer the culprit
905218 i still hold the opinion that the liberal media has overblown the global warming crisis

905253 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense

905349 alexander solzhenitsyn was a man of immense personal courage and as a writer the one indisputable heir of tolstoy
905350 stalin once said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic in his books solzhenitsyn managed to reduce the horror of the stalinist regime to a human and palpable level
905351 his books came out of intense human suffering and in my opinion that is one of the reasons why he deserved his nobel prize
905352 all solzhenitsyns great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny personal freedom once he got it didnt give him a lot to write about that was i suppose because in his way he was a creation of the soviet system that was his subject matter

905357 i think that anytime you meditate you bring down your heart rate which is a good idea to keep cool anytime your heart rate increases youre using up metabolic energy which makes you hot
905358 eating spicy food may increase your metabolic rate which is exactly opposite of what you want to do because it causes you to expend more energy and that will work against keeping cool
905359 when you eat smaller meals your body doesnt have to work so hard to break down the food
905360 the longer you can go without washing your hair the better
905361 there are oils in your hair which help tame the frizz
905362 i was concerned that people would think that this is a biography of someone or this is about a particular young woman
905363 i also didnt want people to think that i was this way but in the end i just thought it would be a fun thing to do and it would shed light on the industry theres a dark side to it and its very easy to get caught up in it
905364 id never actually spent time in a real high school before
905365 ive been tutored since the seventh grade so it was really cool to spend time with kids my age

905381 people need to understand china not only what chinas people are about but what the government is about and our relationship
905382 with my mind it is much more about the memory of names and words
905383 i think im pretty much to where i was with less live reporting
905384 i certainly was out of it live reporting for a good year because of my inability to come up with a particular word
905385 my kids and i love it out on the water we get away from the crowds by kayaking out to explore the inlets and coves and weve tried the new rage of standup paddling on the surfboard

905392 and it must be noted in terms of compassion that this administration has done more to fight aids around the globe than any previous one
905393 but im very dissatisfied with what congress has been able to do and what they havent done

905413 most code is the expression of desires through the expansion of code design patterns with metadata name anything that you have written lately that wasnt like that to some extent
905414 if this is true and we were ever to find a way to represent our desires more precisely succinctly what would be left of our day jobs could we ever boil our practical work down to just coding the business logic and nothing else what kind of development environment would we need to be able to do that would you want to work in that kind of environment
905415 the real question is do you think that business requirements will ever allow us to only code within a sandbox framework i havent been in a single environment where the business needs havent pushed the envelope of cost time performance which usually requires custom solutions or out of the box thinking

905422 my tests continued to be negative for a year and a half then it came out of hiding

905512 whatever has to happen will happen and then again i felt helpless for not being in control
905513 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
905514 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
905515 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
905516 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
905517 we warned folk to only deal with authorised ticket suppliers
905518 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
905519 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
905520 there may be tickets on ebay that are delivered but i think it is a great risk that would be my message
905521 all six of them got off the bus on the orange line and a fight ensued and one of the gang members pulled a gun and shot once
905522 actually the suspects ended up getting hurt more than the others
905523 theres always the question what were the victims doing that may have prompted the assault could it have been something that was just mutual combat
905524 but the one who took out the gun and shot there is no justification unless it was life or death
905525 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight
905526 there should be absolutely zero question that spacex will prevail in reaching orbit and demonstrating reliable space transport
905527 the biggest benefit of alibabas management having more control is that theyd also have more incentive to improve the companys performance said wen via
905528 it seems like these days everyone has a television show to pitch
905529 the idea of pitching is like the american dream its living on your wits and based on a good idea you can make your fortune
905530 is every episode a one off or is there a serial aspect to the show
905531 the aliens are abducting people and sucking them into their television content there will be disembodied heads and eventually the viewers will recognize the heads
905532 but does someone end up with an agent or a production deal or just make some good contacts yes
905533 the value is not only for the person pitching but for the industry too they come here for free because they could spot that diamond in the rough
905534 the show combines the quick wit of laugh in with the edge of the dave chappell show it would be part the apprentice with tv writers competing within a tv writers room and part sketch comedy
905535 i have to be honest with you they offered me store manager

905562 estos datos son muy preocupantes porque aunque se sigue creando empleo este no absorbe el crecimiento de la poblaci n activa y porque m s all de las cifras expresan una situaci n que afecta a personas concretas por ello es preciso reforzar y potenciar con los servicios de empleo de las comunidades aut nomas los instrumentos que favorezcan la mejora de la empleabilidad y de la colocaci n

905564 el desempleo crece con m s intensidad en aquellos territorios donde se dio un crecimiento econ mico acelerado vinculado a la construcci n en comunidades en las que la actividad econ mica est m s diversificada y que cuentan con un tejido de peque as y medianas empresas din micas y con posici n global el desempleo de la epa crece con menor intensidad e incluso en algunas zonas desciende
905565 que lleva tres meses consecutivos con descensos del paro registrado
905566 la creaci n renovaci n y mantenimiento de la actividad econ mica es clave para el dinamismo del empleo por ello ser preciso analizar y potenciar las circunstancias que fortalecen un tejido empresarial capaz de generar productividad y empleo
905567 las mujeres est n saliendo menos perjudicadas tanto en t rminos de empleo como de desempleo
905568 la situaci n del paro de larga duraci n es decir aquel de las personas que llevan m s de un a o en desempleo sigue disminuyendo y se mantiene como uno de los m s bajos de europa en julio representan el 27 8 frente al 28 1 del mes anterior lo que quiere decir que el 72 de los desempleados llevan menos de un a o en paro

905577 with simon amp schusters blessings foxy brown underwent extensive surgical procedures in january 2006 and a lengthy recovery time fighting to restore her hearing
905578 she realized her sentence would include regular drug testing and anger management classes
905579 dropped the complaints in return for both sides agreeing not to have contact with each other and not to discuss the case in the media
905580 accused of failing to keep appointments with probation officers appear for anger management classes and submit to drug tests
905581 brown was bounced from a big apple anger management program for allegedly threatening a staffer
905582 she was booked on battery and obstruction of justice charges and spent the night in jail before posting a 1 500 bond the following day
905583 when asked for a comment naomi campbell replied ha that bitch is even crazier than me
905584 shes getting married shes three months pregnant she signed a record deal two weeks ago and she is in contract for a reality tv show
905585 turns out it really wasnt a baby so much as an unabashed plea for leniency thankfully neither the pregnancy nor the reduced punishment really panned out
905586 i did almost a year in prison a year in prison just because my name is foxy brown
905587 the plea deal allows the rapper to avoid a felony assault charge
905588 for fans of foxy you could find some enjoyment even if no one else would
905589 unfortunately during my incarceration this cd was compiled without my approval i heard this cd in its entirety for the first time just days ago and was devastated
905590 the point i will make at the conference is that those statutes apart from their very broad and vague wording are very bad for the central issue of the epidemic which is getting treatment to people
905591 african health care systems were not ok before the aids epidemic and have become better after the opening of clinics
905592 even my staff encounter problems with them we have the endorsement of the narcotics authorities and we give needles not drugs
905593 so if they catch our clients with drugs we cant stop them but you cant catch those with just needles
905594 we have our outreach workers getting arrested they authorities raid and catch everyone we are forever trying to bail out our outreach workers from the lockup which is a major headache on a day to day basis
905595 infections are going up but surveillance is very poor in malaysia
905596 many young msm only know of their illness for the first time when they are warded with aids how long have they been positive how long have they been infectious it is critical
905597 have wives drug users patronize sex workers they buy sex they sell sex
905598 intensified action to move towards universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support
905599 although we have seen real progress in the last two years if we want to continue to see results we will need to see more financial resources and commitment
905600 are still five new infections for every two people who are newly added on treatment
905601 time to ramp up funding from all sources not to slow down or go on to other things
905602 were on the path toward victory here lets invest more
905603 not sure we will ever get to a point where we can say hiv aids is not a public health problem
905604 fail to see aids treatment for what it is a stop gap measure to tide humanity over until we can collectively reach what ought to be our real goal stopping hivs spread entirely
905605 individual basis living with aids is a proper goal on a population basis it is catastrophic
905606 viewed as an interim step its funding and expansion make sense not only morally but also as a practical matter of economics and foreign policy
905607 b ut only if a massive commitment to finding searches for both a vaccine and cure for hiv are sustained for years to come
905608 ought to be eliminated entirely from the pantheon of threats to humanity
905609 exceed your customers expectations to the point that they will in effect become unpaid salespeople for your company
905610 apparently even your really stalwart mormon pioneer women werent as stalwart as me
905611 acted under the direction so this tells us that the second priesthood restoration must have happened after may 15 1829
905612 peter and james and john whom i have sent unto you by whom i have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles and especial witnesses of my name and bear the keys of your ministry and of the same things which i revealed unto them
905613 for some time made this matter a subject of humble prayer
905614 got together in the chamber of mr whitmers house in order more particularly to seek the lord what we now so earnestly desired
905615 ordain oliver cowdery to be an elder in the church of jesus christ and that he also should ordain joseph to the same office and then
905616 will further illustrate the nature of our calling to this priesthood as well as that of others who were yet to be sought after
905617 paul mine apostle for you are called even with that same calling with which he was called
905618 at a period when joseph and oliver were being pursued by their enemies
905619 the restoration of the melchezidek priesthood didnt occur because of these problematic sources

905623 there are now nearly 1 5 million kenyans living with the virus this is nothing less than a national crisis
905624 the only way to reverse this epidemic is through prevention
905625 we have made notable progress however hiv aids rates among our families and communities remains unacceptably high and the impact severe
905626 until the new crop comes whatever restrictions are there will stay in place
905627 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years

905646 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
905647 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
905648 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
905649 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato

905654 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano

905682 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
905683 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
905684 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
905685 im excited its good to have him back in the house
905686 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
905687 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
905688 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
905689 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
905690 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
905691 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback

905693 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
905694 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
905695 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
905696 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 of the worlds population
905697 in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members

905711 we gave him a decent impression about what the club is about and in the end he decided to choose adelaide which is excellent
905712 im going to be doing extra work on my own to get myself in the best possible shape for the start of the season
905713 carbon filtration of tap water will dramatically lower levels of toxic by products it is also 10 to 20 times less expensive than bottled water and does not produce the waste and pollution associated with the packaging and transport of bottled water
905714 we deserve a lot of credit for that performance because chivas are one of the biggest teams in mexico and have a huge fanbase around the world and we have played very well
905715 we know how to score goals and everyone works together to defend that is how we now play the feeling is that whoever plays we can be calm
905716 another good point is that we have had no injuries and that everyone played well we are now adapted to things in the united states
905717 we suffered a bit because of jet lag the pitch was very slow too but we have done well the players know what is expected and they were excellent
905718 i do not want us to use a lot of energy in these two games though because we have the champions league qualifier where we will need everyone to be fresh
905719 i did not expect us to score so many goals and to create so many chances the only bad thing was that we conceded two goals but we will look at that
905720 he is with us and we are using him we know all about his quality

905722 samuel is one of the best players in the world i do not know what is happening with the club because that is not my job but samuel is very important for us
905723 when the team pushes up it is a lot more easy to score goals when you win everything works better unlike last season we now press further up the field and the team is defending well
905724 we want a full sponsorship of the league attractive financial rewards and a conducive playing venue
905725 we also want a rescheduling of the league to october the start of the dry season as the heavy rains this time of the year have a great impact on the wear and tear of our playing equipment
905726 we cant imagine the lfa is pushing us to play at venues with no security at all
905727 the lfa is looking into improving the league through sponsorship but with the teams bickering it would be difficult to attract such a deal
905728 the results of pre season do not matter what is important is that we pick up our fitness levels and build the atmosphere back up within the squad
905729 in the end the results will come our objective is now to be ready for the game on august 13 against schalke 04 and that is all we are thinking about
905730 with the introduction of the camera though we can now capture our subjects in their exact likeness through photographs

905810 in 2005 the most recent year for which data are available cnms attended more than 306 000 births or 11 2 percent of all vaginal births

905813 labor is considered agonizing across all times places and cultures women in indigeneous societies do not have painless labors
905814 in other words a woman may call her birth experience agonizing but to make a categorical statement that birth is considered
905815 a minority of women dont want pain medication in labor and dont want any interventions that is their right but obstetricians know that those women do not understand the risks of childbirth they grossly underestimate them and do not understand that supposed risks of technology they grossly overestimate them therefore they are not making informed decisions
905816 other side of the fence her ignorant generalizations reveal her arrogance
905817 choosing not to have birthing interventions does not mean that someone is uninformed my god the arrogance of that perspective is just saddening
905818 the majority of american women want pain medication in labor they want the routine use of technology and they want above all to have a healthy baby american obstetricians are working to meet those needs a minority of women dont want pain medication in labor and dont want any interventions that is their right but obstetricians know that those women do not understand the risks of childbirth they grossly underestimate them and do not understand that supposed risks of technology they grossly overestimate them therefore they are not making informed decisions

905839 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
905840 one dutch was rescued by helicopter from k2 this morning while an italian is still at an altitude of 7 200 metres
905841 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
905842 the three mountaineers who survived are suffering from severe frostbite
905843 they are badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
905844 the rope collapsed and the climbers started falling in various directions some fell in neighbouring china some in pakistan
905845 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
905846 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
905847 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
905848 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
905849 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
905850 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
905851 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behavior which poses a danger on the country
905852 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
905853 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
905854 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
905855 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
905856 the bite broke the skin but it didnt tear his leg up that bad
905857 tamir came to practice on crutches so he could be with his team

905860 when crack cocaine came about in the 80s thats when all hell broke loose
905861 i started using cocaine on the weekends and before i realized what was happening it became an everyday obsession i had to have it
905862 that day was the quietest moment in my life from the time i was in my mothers womb
905863 in recovery they say we surrender quietly on that day there was something so serene about the quietness that was telling me yo its over with this october 2nd will be 18 years since i went into treatment i still go to 12 step meetings i always will
905864 go back into your community and be a vision of hope for folks that are less fortunate
905865 last summer we had eight teams playing on two fields
905866 this summer we have 18 teams playing on nine fields this summer were saving twice as many kids lives man from ages 6 to 16
905867 4th and dauphin 21st and cecil b moore 22nd and lehigh 27th and master 32nd and huntingdon 27th and clearfield 12th and york
905868 theres lots of gunfire in this neck of the woods
905869 we try to grab kids young and get them into baseball because otherwise theyre spending the summer standing on the corner doing nothing and they get caught up in somebody elses web
905870 if i could get 10 cats like him if i could get me 10 aarons id have no worries man aaron is god centered he has no ego he knows its not about him its about the kids
905871 its about knowing that if these kids are here playing baseball and we are here for them and we can see them theyre not out running in the streets risking getting caught in a crossfire
905872 strike him out baby and i got a shrimp for you
905873 in ortho you just drill stuff and its so cool

905878 as a primary care physician they trust you more than any other doctor
905879 they have a lot of questions and they want to learn a lot its up to us to give them exposure to what we do
905880 i never knew what a heart looked like up close or thought about how you would have to open the ribs to get into it
905881 it kind of grosses you out the body isnt pretty inside its so deep in there
905882 how could parents have been so unloving how could professionals have been so indifferent and most of all
905883 how could the philadelphia department of human services the giant expensive safety net we have set up to protect the children of uncaring or incompetent parents have been so uncaring and incompetent
905884 the lack of attention we paid to this case its a huge system failure
905885 im the commissioner at dhs and i have every intention of doing all that needs to be done to correct the deficiencies that were pointed out in this report
905886 our role is to help vulnerable children and families and we failed
905887 i probably would have assigned anne marie which tells me i still have the confidence in her to turn this agency around
905888 this organization has been studied again and again and again its an organization that is very good at starting but has had a tradition of not being able to move change all the way through the system
905889 im ok with people telling us were doing something wrong and revisiting a decision
905890 it occurred to us as we looked through the pile of candidates nationally that we had a gem
905891 many people were focused on the system as a system anne marie was focused on children and families
905892 create a culture of accountability throughout dhs at all levels starting with senior management
905893 there have been many reform efforts in the past that have followed tragic child deaths yet they were inadequate in one crucial way
905894 they lacked sustained leadership and management structure that would allow any of the recommendations to be implemented correctly or to hold anyone accountable for their failure or success
905895 i think annie does have her work cut out for her
905896 the unions position has always been we would like to see accountability on all levels annie is the person to do that she is somebody who does believe in management being even more responsible than people on the lower level of the totem pole
905897 i really do cut to the chase i am decisive i try to include everybodys viewpoints
905898 i want someone there who knows the child and presents the case our structure is not conducive to doing individual advocacy on these kids and that has to change
905899 im thinking one thing and youre thinking another and lets get on the same page
905900 i thought i had a job and she had a passion
905901 i dont know if envious is the word but i was impressed by the fact that she woke up every day and went to work for much different reasons than i did
905902 you asked me what makes me smile when i think of her and thats it she loves kids and really is fighting for them
905903 if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 per cent or so still is very useful for us
905904 we understand they are disappointed because they had been awaiting for the approval but did not obtain it within the time of period they expected
905905 but china oriental and arcelormittal have so far never talked about giving up raising the stake
905906 the look on the kids faces was better than any kind of medal we could have gotten

905959 i think its definitely a time of change the players in four years are going to look a lot different than the players that have been around for the last 30 or 40
905960 i think its a great time of opportunity for people who want to be involved
905961 they may not have terrific name recognition today but they have credibility and connections within the political system and it wont take much for them to really break through
905962 coalition building seems like the default way to do things nowadays rather than the exception to the rule
905963 the fact that a number of city council people seem to be ready to go will just breathe more life into that momentum for change
905964 puff went poof at the slightest provocation it became a source of embarrassment on more than one occasion

905994 it seems that the issue to the south has increased to an undismissable degree
905995 it is no longer a matter of missing chickens and slain stock less than a week ago a man was murdered in broad daylight while trying to defend his herd and two weeks before that a child went missing into the red forest this brings the casualties to near one hundred animals dead and six people the southern boarder threatens us with hostility and civil unrest this threat must stop and peace must be restored
905996 indeed the dead are growing steadily and we will soon be counting from the city gates

906011 when you see them up at two in the morning talking or crying or sharing gossip were right there with them
906012 id say i became like a big sister to some of them
906013 when they were having a problem i was certainly willing to provide advice i hope it was good advice
906014 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
906015 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
906016 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
906017 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
906018 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
906019 at a time when hard pressed taxpayers are struggling with the rising cost of living and labours tax hikes the public will rightly question why the government is splashing around such a large amount of taxpayers cash on office furniture and plants
906020 the government should practice what it preaches and start living within its means
906021 we knew that it would be hard to score boundaries on this pitch after the rain
906022 o meu minist rio tem s rias reservas sobre a op o pelo nuclear e julgamos que a discuss o est deslocada no tempo

906026 an essential part of growing up adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
906027 the research shows that children need to experience challenging play in order to develop important life skills and to better manage risk and challenge in their daily lives
906028 however opportunities for children to take such risks are limited this is due to our risk averse culture and an increase in health and safety constraints it is clear that we need to address the current cotton wool culture and to provide children with more opportunities for adventurous play
906029 our sympathy goes out to the family following this tragic death and it has been a difficult day for our coastguard rescue team and other rescuers involved today
906030 with school holidays in full swing we want to warn families to be aware of the dangers of tunnelling in sand
906031 im doing a full circle im coming back to performing after many years of taking a bit of a hiatus
906032 usually its the other way around im working towards becoming a waiter eventually thats my goal it may sound silly
906033 its a different form of expression too writing for yourself and its something id always wanted to do theres a lot of risk involved but im having a blast to be honest with you
906034 americans are only voting for the chance to vote for a black president
906035 once they get to the general election i think theyll find a 73 year old white republican is just about the kind of change theyre ready for
906036 i think about that line a lot actually its a little scary
906037 and its about race and politics am i black enough how black do you need to be
906038 its called primarily colored and it deals with the politics of authenticity
906039 not as funny as kennedy hes a little stiffer to me
906040 politicians i dont trust their sense of humor these days i always feel somebody gave them a joke you know im not saying that didnt happen back then but kennedy certainly was quick
906041 ive seen obama be quick in certain situations ive seen mccain the same way too hillary clinton i think has an underappreciated sense of humor ive seen her be very funny in off the cuff situations
906042 i think im coming in to being able to get away with how ive been for a long time
906043 when i did stand up when i was in my 20s and i had this approach it always worked in stand up but it didnt translate well to television
906044 so now im very happy that im old enough to have my sense of humor come across
906045 were living in extraordinary times right now too you know and to have a candidate like mr obama and the fact that the daily show is going to be at the conventions you know its just huge i just feel so fortunate to be able to do it
906046 this is my own unit and it was great to start from here
906047 we have already optioned wonderland to a producer in hollywood
906048 it is in the initial stages of development right now and we are hoping things move along smoothly
906049 if things go according to plan the film will go into production early next year and we will have a late 2009 or early 2010 release although in my experience dealing with hollywood things rarely go as planned we are keeping our fingers crossed
906050 i think ours was darker than anything else that is out
906051 taking alices daughter and sending her back into a twisted version of wonderland is something i dont think has been done before fans really love and seem to identify with calie especially our female readers
906052 ive been waiting to bring wolverine to comic con for years
906053 marvel and lionsgate really understand and listen when the fans speak
906054 is it worth the gamble to marry a man with as little character as this one has shown
906055 if hes not with the one he loves then he loves the one hes with
906056 the books most important lesson is that 21st century governments should try to improve peoples lives not through mandates and bans but through creative nudges that do not force anyone to do anything
906057 there are lessons to be learnt in the handling of power both the main protagonists in the book suleiman the magnificent and charles v were burned out trying to micromanage their empires
906058 stakhanov like work ethic to get through all of keiths list
906059 every time i speak to him all i can hear is excited cries in the background of dolphins on the port side an impressive degree of nautical accuracy from his young family
906060 the rain has been lashing down so he cant have spent much time on the beach
906061 mannys unbelievable but to see him have an impact as quick as hes had it its really amazing
906062 i dont care who you are youve still got to have some nervousness at the plate and for him to be able to relax and hit that ball out that was big for us ive never really played with a player quite that caliber
906063 i like that theyve got my back and ive got their back
906064 im just trying to fit in with these guys relax and try to do my job weve still got a long way to go
906065 you put him in any lineup and manny is the difference maker
906066 i dont care what lineup hes in hes going to be the difference
906067 its not like it was really weighing on my mind but when you get that first home run out of the way you start relaxing
906068 after those bad outings i had i felt like i wasnt contributing at all and was a burden on the team
906069 catcher russell martin researched arizonas lineup and i just threw what he asked me to throw
906070 hes just fun to have around hes energetic and outspoken he wants to have fun after the home run i told him to go out for the curtain call with one swing of his bat he can lift a team its what he does i feel like we just hit the lottery with him in the lineup
906071 going in you want more than that but when you lose the first two games it would be great
906072 again wed still be a game behind but it certainly would be huge for us at this point in time especially at home losing the first two games
906073 i dont want to come back and feel anything after i play
906074 i want to get everything to feel all right 100 percent back surgery is a bad thing and i dont want to rush
906075 for us to count on him would be wrong but ive gotten the message dont discount him coming back
906076 i feel at home already the weather is nice the stadium is beautiful
906077 at the end of the season well find out if the dodgers want me to finish my career here were going to sit down and talk about the situation
906078 i like it here im looking for peace i want to stay here at the end of the season if the dodgers want me to end my career here well sit down and talk time will tell
906079 its hard for him to know that after one game but i left new york and the first day at spring training i loved it with the dodgers
906080 its much different than hes used to maybe hell enjoy what hes doing ive enjoyed it here
906081 im not that fast im 5 3 to first base remember
906082 my doctor told me i was a happy meal away from diabetes
906083 there are 76 000 children in child welfare care and over 22 000 we know are actively waiting for adoption right now
906084 we actually have three times the number of first nations children in child welfare care today than we did at the height of the residential schools
906085 we actually have three times the number of first nations children in child welfare care today than we did at the height of the residential schools
906086 in 1959 only one per cent of canadian children in custody were native a decade later the number had risen to 40 per cent
906087 our way home a report to the aboriginal healing and wellness strategy on the repatriation of aboriginal people removed by the child welfare system
906088 a staggering 85 per cent of the children in care were first nations children although first nations people made up only 25 per cent of the population the number of first nations children adopted by non first nations parents increased fivefold from the early 1960s to the late 1970s non first nations families accounted for 78 per cent of the adoptions of first nations children
906089 one manitoba community of 800 people lost 150 children to adoption between 1966 1980
906090 cultural genocide has been taking place in a systematic routine manner one gets an image of children stacked in foster homes as used cars are stacked on corner lots just waiting for the right buyer to stroll by
906091 those womyn are poor they cant provide were wealthy two parent families we can do what they cant
906092 first nations drum june 08 vol 18 issue 6 piece entitled
906093 indigenous peoples have the collective right to live in freedom peace and security as distinct people with guarantees against genocide or any other act of violence including the removal of indigenous children from their families and communities under any pretext
906094 british colonialism has a certain process and formula and its been applied around the world with different populations often indigenous populations in different countries that they choose to colonize
906095 and that is to make people into good little englishmen
906096 these jellyfish near shore are a message the sea is sending us saying look how badly you are treating me
906097 human caused stresses including global warming and overfishing are encouraging jellyfish surpluses in many tourist destinations and productive fisheries
906098 one of the things we are committed to is not evaluating based only on short term performance spikes in the positive direction or the negative direction
906099 were trying to understand what the foundation of what the players tools package is and what the players makeup is how likely is that tools package to be able to impact his performance and again we cant be influenced overly by a dramatic spike in one direction or another
906100 if its boston or wherever it might be thats the silver lining a little bit of sweet
906101 at this time of year i would definitely like to be part of that atmosphere
906102 my daughter niece grand daughter wont fall for such things
906103 normal stuff and then when all is quiet and the cats are busy outside catching mice the muse wakes up and i am off and running
906104 they did a good job of calling timeouts or substituting when there was a free throw usually on a free throw we get the ball and take off and run they did a good job of offensive rebounding too
906105 we kind of settled down and we understood what we had to do we got steals we got stops and we scored on the other end
906106 here youre talking about kobe and jason two elderly statesmen if you will leaders competitors they truly are the leaders of this team the younger players im talking about carmelo lebron wade all of them they defer to kobe and to jason as leaders
906107 i am excited about the expanded coverage we are offering to our clients with these new categories
906108 we are leading the way as one of the internets finest and most extensive coverage of the celebrity and entertainment world
906109 mass circumcision campaigns will result in hundreds of thousands of complications and could make the hiv crisis worse
906110 there are already numerous reports of males lining up to get circumcised so they no longer will need to use condoms
906111 male circumcision is a dangerous distraction in the hiv battle even if circumcision does offer some degree of reduced risk per sexual incident individuals engaged in high risk behavior are still at risk for hiv and circumcision does not protect women giving circumcised males and their partners the false impression that they are protected will make the situation worse by increasing risk taking behavior further mass circumcision campaigns will likely overwhelm the already overburdened african healthcare infrastructure and divert resources away from other needed and more effective hiv prevention strategies
906112 i believe sms is for the better because it is useful especially in times of emergencies
906113 i think it is for worse because it causes some of the students to lose their focus on studying and just text their classmates about useless stuffs in some ways it is just a waste of money
906114 sms is for the better it is that we use for quick information it can save money from calling it can also give the latest news

906128 i dont know if robert benchley ever commented on operas in his writings but it is certainly a subject i suspect he would have handled exactly as you did
906129 it certainly brought back the memories of when i first started reading robert benchley and the joy his writing brought
906130 the judging was difficult because the finalists were so good
906131 really good writing is timeless benchley created like the persona jack benny created a man who was very much full of himself but in a self deprecating way
906132 my influences came from the more absurdist side of life
906133 larry gilbert writer on your show of shows a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and others too numerous to remember once wrote the comedy writer and comedian sees the world through a different lens
906134 i was a voracious reader of the works of robert benchley
906135 and at least on a subconscious level one of benchleys essays influenced me to go to law school it was about a walter mitty type character who made an absolute fool out of the opposing counsel to the point where the jury was applauding and even the judge was enjoying the show
906136 yikes i cant believe it thanks im still in shock
906137 i can barely maintain my sobriety cuz the great robert benchley society held a contest and wow im a finalist now will i win the top prize high anxiety
906138 now that ive actually won first prize im thrilled and honored but being jewish im still anxious
906139 how to watch a sad movie and retain your manliness
906140 hooray thank you so much and many thanks to mr newhart
906141 in fact right now im making sounds to express my thrilledness but they cant be conveyed in an email without doing some small damage to the keyboard
906142 essays are tough especially at 500 words i wrote my entry in a benchleyesq frenzy i was reading a lot of sweet old bob at the time and the influence shows benchley has always been my favorite humorist
906143 to go from being an accountant to being a stand up comic has always been a dream of mine
906144 thanks for the wonderful news i assume this means i get my 10 entry fee back
906145 all who value humor look up to robert benchley and wonder how the hell does he make it look so easy for this benchley aficionado its a bit numbing having my name linked with his
906146 and this is back when 30 a week was like 20 a week
906147 knowing bob newhart actually read something i wrote even if he barely got through the first paragraph before crumpling and tossing it is intimidating i have grown up with newharts albums stand up movies and television to understand and appreciate what a brilliant humorist he is
906148 this would be the highlight of my career if i had one
906149 the book that most impressed me when i was growing up and influenced my approach to comedy would have been any book by robert benchley or specifically my ten years in a quandary
906150 all entries are read blind so neither bob newhart nor any of the preliminary judges knew who wrote any of the essays that way the competition is entirely merit based
906151 but darn i will enter again next year and see if i make the top ten one more time ill be the poor mans ed tasca he placed 3 times maybe i can get on the top ten list 3 times
906152 i believe mr benchley would be pleased to see how this years contestants are keeping alive his tradition of warm genial witty humor
906153 i hope future judges are as lucky as i was in the quality of their finalists

906161 theres no doubt that those chair sniffing and bra snapping issues have made it difficult for us to obtain the clear air that we need
906162 it polling didnt show i was unelectable i resigned on a simple application of a principle that principle is what is the best interests of the liberal party
906163 theres a window of political opportunity in this state that has been opened its my view we would be better served by an alternate leader to take advantage
906164 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
906165 troy has worked hard as leader in difficult circumstances and has put the liberal party in a strong position to contest the state election
906166 ive been saying mr buswell was unelectable and thats been proved correct
906167 the emperor had a lovely set of clothes for about three months
906168 he said he would think about it but wanted to do it bloodlessly its looking like that will happen now
906169 i think it will regenerate the party we had no show with mr buswell as leader its still going to be very difficult but we will have a fighting chance
906170 ive enjoyed it and ill continue to work on the issues until the day i leave but im leaving
906171 people are switching off politics which i think is a very unfortunate situation it certainly makes it tough for troy to compete against alan carpenter
906172 its clearly a move for the moment rather than a move of where the partys going to be or will be in the future
906173 its a surprise in the sense that he seemed to be hanging on and it looked as though thats what he was going to do and also that the alternative is so unusual and fraught
906174 i mean you are going to bring back someone who said they are going to retire and in the process youre going to upset the endorsement of one of your star new recruits which is presumably what they are going to have to do
906175 its also very much a papering over the cracks move because presumably in the long term theyve got to find someone else
906176 this is an impressive book the subject has been thoroughly researched and carefully presented all the machine models central to the modern theory of computation are covered in depth many for the first time in textbook form readers will learn a great deal from the wealth of interesting material presented
906177 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now

906199 as long as you have a computer and internet access you can study high quality chinese internal martial arts anytime anywhere
906200 too many people believe the power of these arts comes from something mystical
906201 they focus on this invisible energy called chi and they miss or arent told about the physical skills they need this site is dedicated to pulling back the curtain and showing principles for the physical skills that are required by these arts skills that most chinese kung fu masters wouldnt teach you for many years

906207 we are genuinely interested in learning about how truck drivers are using technology to prosper during these difficult times
906208 we thought giving the winner a brand new laptop equipped with gaming capabilities and a built in web cam would make the contest particularly appealing
906209 we join the rest of the country in celebrating the contributions made by americas truck drivers
906210 truckers are essential to our nations economic health and to our individual comfort without them our society simply cannot function

906217 as far as were concerned nick is a lifer with this organization hes not going anywhere at all
906218 weve simply taken the position of founding director and split it in two so we will now have a chief curator and an executive director as the two most senior management positions nick is going to be the chief curator because its important that he be able to spend 100 percent of his attention in this area there is no one more qualified for this job than nick
906219 thanks to nicks tireless and dedicated leadership weve been successfully founded and now were ready to move on to the next phase its a function of our growth and our success that wherever possible we need to move away from people having to do multiple functions that cant be reasonably and effectively accomplished by one person which is so common in a start up operation to allow people to focus on their strengths and areas of expertise
906220 as we quietly grew to 25 full time employees the administration was getting sufficiently complex and time consuming i was also beginning to spend a lot of time on the road so the opportunity to focus on curatorial and programming affairs was a welcome relief and allows me to sail into my dotage doing what i truly love
906221 nick is still functioning as hes always functioned there is no vacancy so were going to hire the new person as soon as we can find the perfect candidate for the job
906222 access affordability and accountability are critical issues for all of higher education but the meaning of these concepts and pursuit of these goals differ for adult students and the institutions that serve them it is my hope that future public policy will consider the needs of adult students and the particular challenges that they face

906228 so does this man have the virus in his blood
906229 i could not find the words to tell you so i thought i could let you know slowly by allowing you to observe my work and through what i spoke to the couple this afternoon at the hospital
906230 why has it taken so long for your family to find a suitable girl for marriage
906231 i keep putting it off and discouraging them as i have hiv and besides i have not told them about my status yet
906232 do you still want to marry me now that i have told you everything
906233 i will marry you because i love you and it has nothing to do with you having hiv
906234 he may not live for even three more years since his diagnosis i urge you to reconsider
906235 even if he were to live for just three minutes after our wedding ceremony i will still marry him
906236 why do things have to happen this way to people its not fair
906237 if you truly loved me why did you sit back and allow all of this to happen to me
906238 if all of this did not happen how would you have been able to receive the gift of
906239 but this road has been long and very hard for me to walk on and i am scared
906240 i dont know what i would have done if you hadnt been here youre really my friend
906241 i hear sounds above the shuffling of my feet as i make my way down this strange familiar street the holy sound of families their dinners on the wind will i ever be able to sit at that table again
906242 hope that hides in darkness healing under pain roses asleep in the winter but the spring will come again
906243 my feet will walk a golden street and when all is said and done i will be found on holy ground as a good and faithful son
906244 and when i least expect it i believe these things are true its as if to say i am on my way from here here on bright avenue
906245 to be held in the heart of a friend is to be a king
906246 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission mr barltett said
906247 this is a very popular service and as a world heritage site visitor numbers are growing each year
906248 we work very closely with the national trust to make this attraction as accessible as possible to everyone and with a steep slope down to the stones many people chose to use the bus particularly those with walking difficulties or parents with small children
906249 these new vehicles are being very well received by everyone and are seen as a showcase for public transport in ni
906250 for many visitors it is their first experience of using the bus and they have been most impressed with the quality and comfort they offer
906251 the giants causeway is northern irelands premier tourism asset in caring for this world heritage site it is equally important that we care for the 600 000 tourists and locals who annually visit the stones
906252 by providing the two new mini buses on site translink are ensuring that those who visit the national trust property have access to the spectacular views and the all famous stones the fact that the buses have strong environmental credentials is also a welcome factor
906253 we love the yale womens center and all the services it provides

906255 i was concerned before the race that he may miss the break but he broke well
906256 steve said he didnt have a hard race and that the gaps werent coming so he had to switch round
906257 it will be hard for him to win another handicap so we will have to try him in listed or group races now and ill have to talk to prince khalid to try to keep him in the uk as he will ultimately go to america
906258 this horse travels and picks up for you and when the gaps come he goes for them
906259 hes so tough hes won a britannia and he ran well at sandown from a bad draw but hes popped out today and won
906260 you dont often win two big handicaps in a season
906261 i de manca de respecte per unes entitats que practiquen un esport que durant molts anys ha servit per donar vida a un espai que desgraciadament lajuntament no ha tingut mai present tot i el simbolisme i la import ncia que t en la nostra hist ria ara en canvi aquest espai que hauria de rebre un tractament especial i molt acurat molts cops est ple de brut cia a partir de les activitats que es programen des del mateix ajuntament

906268 i was right at the fence and people were pulling my hair back and pushing everyone forward ive seen rage two other times before and its never been like this
906269 i cant wait but maybe ill stand back a little further this time
906270 it can get intense but the band is extremely aware and responsible
906271 there were a few minor injuries but im not aware of any major injuries if there were anything bad i wouldve known about it
906272 when security opened up the exit gates to let people leave the crowd across the street saw it as their chance to get in
906273 but police were keeping an eye on them and shut it down pretty quickly it was not a big problem
906274 sometimes kids camp out at a stage all day and forget to eat and drink waiting for one band and it can lead to problems
906275 we dont have any information about it we have not heard of this matter
906276 the beijing olympics is facing a terrorist threat unsurpassed in olympic history

906283 maybe around getting your guitar solo on the white gold site a battle of bands to join the group for a virtual guest spot
906284 we are going to see how many possible offshoots we can come up with
906285 we feel that its really almost limitless in terms of where we can take it
906286 we started out with five real songs and created music videos with singles and ultimately a full album
906287 i think at this point we are going to let it happen a little organically we are seeding it with certain web sites some music related some that scour the web for weird wacky things
906288 monetisation work we were doing there didnt pan out as well as we had hoped
906289 self professed bold innovative ad campaign featuring a talking apple voiced by comedian and actress wanda sykes is being dropped it lasted all of four months i really hated that apple or perhaps it was sykes voice that grated on me
906290 as marketing evolves this has gone a new direction with a new campaign
906291 this was an opportunity to take our marketing in a new direction that was produced by mccann erickson and theyre still on board with us and highlights our desire as the commercial shows to raise the bar on grill and bar food
906292 we think it shows great images of the food thats unique to applebees and all in a setting that show guests out having a good time at their applebees
906293 weve gone back to what we know best which is an applebees that does things differently than everybody else positions them well in the category you can get a quesadilla anywhere but you cant get a steak tower quesadilla anywhere except applebees
906294 the percentage of mortgages in arrears in the category of loans one rung above subprime so called alternative a mortgages quadrupled to 12 percent in april from a year earlier delinquencies among prime loans which account for most of the 12 trillion market doubled to 2 7 percent in that time
906295 the first wave of americans to default on their home mortgages appears to be cresting but a second far larger one is quickly building
906296 homeowners with good credit are falling behind on their payments in growing numbers even as the problems with mortgages made to people with weak or subprime credit are showing their first tentative signs of leveling off after two years of spiraling defaults
906297 many borrowers who got these loans during the boom had good credit scores but many of them owe more than their homes are worth analysts believe that many will not be able to or want to make higher payments
906298 the reset of option arm loans is a big event that will drive the timing of delinquencies
906299 defaults are likely to accelerate because many homeowners monthly payments are rising rapidly
906300 what will sting borrowers more than rising interest rates analysts say is having to pay interest and principal every month after spending several years paying only interest or sometimes even less than that such loan terms were popular during the boom with alt a and prime borrowers and appeared appealing while home prices were rising and interest rates were low but now some borrowers could see their payments jump 50 percent or more and they may not be able to sell their properties for as much as they owe
906301 delinquencies in prime and alt a loans are particularly challenging for banks because they hold more such loans on their books than they do subprime mortgages downey financial which owns a savings bank that operates in california and arizona recently reported that 11 2 percent of its loans were delinquent at the end of june a big increase from the 6 1 percent that were past due at the end of last year
906302 even now man may be unwittingly changing the worlds climate through the waste products of his civilization due to our release through factories and automobiles every year of more than 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer

906340 ranbir and deepika appear on the show as a promotion for their film bachna ae haseeno salman was happy to hear the news that the two were coming salman is extremely fond of the saawariya actor and has decided take him under his wing ranbir and salman get along extraordinarily well ranbir looks up to salman as one of his role models sallu is also very fond of ranbirs dad rishi kapoor but ranbir surely didnt expect a gift from salman
906341 after the show wrapped up salman went up to ranbir hugged him and presented him with a portrait of raj kapoor people who saw it were very impressed it was an exact impression of raj kapoor in profile salman must have seen photographs and painted him ranbir was so touched that he had tears in his eyes and hugged salman
906342 after the show ended ranbir showed it to his grandmother krishna for whom it was an extremely emotional moment she has hung up the portrait on a wall of the rk studios office
906343 the best way to find out what happened is to watch the show on august 15
906344 aamir khan has been telling people how well salman has painted him apparently salman has made two drawings of the tzp director while one is a portrait the other is a sketch though salman hasnt presented the painting to aamir yet he has shown it to him the buzz is that he will sell it
906345 although there is overlap among all these groups the areas of focus are distinctly unique of course businesses can benefit by incorporating the expertise from all these areas but theyd need to source it separately
906346 the times demand a radical new phase new labour won three elections by offering real change not just in policy but in the way we do politics we must do so again
906347 i would have sacked him i think hes been grossly disloyal
906348 looking around i see two other people in a row that normally holds nine
906349 i hear others on the phone some of whom seem to be on personal calls
906350 it will get quieter as the afternoon wears on people disappear earlier in the day during july and august it is a ghost town at 4 p m on a friday more like 2 p m
906351 there are however the people who become slightly disconcerted in a quiet office and they seem to need to talk to someone
906352 they tell me about a new car they bought in fargo n d or the dogs thyroid condition or their kids lacrosse coach who has been ordered to take sensitivity training all i can do is nod and try not to let the eyes glaze over
906353 we check the government of canada website for weather updates clean our money in our drawers and try and keep customers here for as long as possible to chat
906354 i am able to get more undivided attention from my superiors
906355 it has been a good chance to ease into this new field of work without the usual pressure and constant multitasking that would occur during a busier time
906356 fewer co workers in the office means there are 1 fewer managers to interfere with my day since theyre all on vacation 2 fewer people to make ridiculous demands on my time see no 1
906357 the younger generation has all the plans and they sort of envy the older ones who have four five six weeks off and plan to do nothing
906358 i will be out of the office until sept 1
906359 i will be in paris until sept 1 touring europe and having amazing experiences while youre chained to your desk sucker
906360 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
906361 i panicked when a pakistani fell straight onto my back with his entire weight i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
906362 at present it is believed that anyone who is classified as position unknown will not be coming back
906363 mr mcdonnell was one of the strongest climbers in the world and it is with great sadness that we now have to mourn his passing
906364 expeditions had been waiting at base camp for up to two months for good weather
906365 these are big mountains and are dangerous at any time they take their toll every year mountaineering is a calculated risk
906366 many people buy these packages to k2 and especially to everest
906367 they are certainly strong people but they do not have enough experience to react they dont know how to behave in the case of emergencies in the case of missing ropes in the case of bad weather
906368 we have strengthened security in all olympic venues and in the olympic village
906369 something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays
906370 much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
906371 you certainly want to hold out hope as long as you possibly can
906372 but its probably a one in a million chance we got reports that people saw him fall
906373 coming down they got to the bottleneck where all these fixed ropes are in place
906374 a huge piece of ice broke off from on or near the summit and it took out the fixed ropes and took out anyone on them
906375 we decided when we were doing our set not to mention it
906376 we felt everyone who knew him would know what was going on at that stage
906377 he loved to have the crack as wed say in ireland
906378 very funny he was a philosopher a great storyteller and just a wonderful warm kind loving person
906379 we all believe were going to win the gold medal so for him to go out there and say that put the pressure on us to go out and compete at a high level
906380 but she definitely came over to talk to him after that as did many people
906381 i think were gonna see that girl win the gold medal
906382 the next day i called my boss and quit my job i decided to raise my daughters
906383 i never had an olympic dream till two years ago

906386 from 1999 through 2005 ihs did not follow required procedures to document the transfer of property from ihs to the alaska native tribal health consortium resulting in an unsuccessful 5 year attempt by ihs to reconcile the inventory
906387 without proper documentation it is impossible to determine what happened with the property which is why we consider it to be lost or stolen
906388 ihs mismanagement led to millions of dollars in lost or stolen property
906389 overall we think that gao continues to include many inaccuracies and misinterpretations in the report
906390 the so called lost or stolen atvs and heavy equipment that were used to build facilities in alaska those were transferred to tribal organizations
906391 we did accept about 7 million in property from the indian health service and that was to enable us to continue program services
906392 we can account for the 7 million that came to us
906393 is a 10 year old car still worth the original purchase price
906394 although u s health and human services comments state that these items were old and had little remaining useful value ihs continues to purchase new property to replace old necessary items in which case it is likely that replacement costs are as much or more than acquisition cost
906395 furthermore analysis of ihss response raises concerns about the nature of disposal for these items including vehicles and machinery which could cause environmental hazards as a result of abandonment

906457 stalin once said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic in his books solzhenitsyn managed to reduce the horror of the stalinist regime to a human and palpable level
906458 his books came out of intense human suffering and in my opinion that is one of the reasons why he deserved his nobel prize
906459 all solzhenitsyns great work was instigated by his experience of tyranny personal freedom once he got it didnt give him a lot to write about that was i suppose because in his way he was a creation of the soviet system that was his subject matter

906524 earlier this year 2005 tulsa mayor bill lafortune announced a new 250 million general obligation bond package that included 32 8 million for flood control improvements with 15 25 million of that amount earmarked to fix the infamous fred creek problem
906525 as voting day drew near oru assistant professor of government dr tim brooker recruited a fearless team of students from his classes who proceeded to flood south tulsa with their efforts to get the vote out not just for proposition 3 flood control but for the entire package
906526 dr brookers operation involved long evenings of phone banking as students went through a list of roughly 38 000 names to zero in on the yes vote base then he had about 20 teams of student volunteers canvassing two precincts each so that on any given saturday students were making an impact on up to 40 precincts at a time
906527 about 100 oru student volunteers enjoyed the fruits of their labors when tulsas 250 million general obligation go bond package was passed on april 5

906536 more than at most such institutions admission to oral roberts universitys two year old o w coburn school of law is a matter of faith all students must be avowed christians once on the tulsa campus they are required to sign pledges to yield my personality to the healing and maturing power of the holy spirit and exemplify christlike character through prayer as a result the american bar association threatened to deny the school its coveted accreditation a condition for admission to the bar in many states reason the requirements seemed to violate a b a standards forbidding religious discrimination in admissions

906541 it is no secret that oru president richard roberts has tulsa mayor bill lafortune in his back pocket roberts publicly supported lafortune a devout roman catholic in the last election and lafortune has made sure the school received certain perks like additional stoplights on the streets around the campus without going through the normal red tape for such things now lafortune makes sure his goons are sent out to protect the delicate student population from these horrible homos

906544 when the irs came calling a couple of months later brooker was told he was to be the fall guy the suit alleges to accept responsibility for the schools involvement in the randi miller campaign and to shield president roberts and the school from any repercussions

906685 eu tenho tanto leite que minha filha fica cheia em 3 minutos
906686 even my staff encounter problems with them we have the endorsement of the narcotics authorities and we give needles not drugs
906687 so if they catch our clients with drugs we cant stop them but you cant catch those with just needles
906688 we have our outreach workers getting arrested they authorities raid and catch everyone we are forever trying to bail out our outreach workers from the lockup which is a major headache on a day to day basis
906689 infections are going up but surveillance is very poor in malaysia
906690 many young msm only know of their illness for the first time when they are warded with aids how long have they been positive how long have they been infectious it is critical
906691 have wives drug users patronize sex workers they buy sex they sell sex
906692 fail to see aids treatment for what it is a stop gap measure to tide humanity over until we can collectively reach what ought to be our real goal stopping hivs spread entirely
906693 individual basis living with aids is a proper goal on a population basis it is catastrophic
906694 viewed as an interim step its funding and expansion make sense not only morally but also as a practical matter of economics and foreign policy
906695 b ut only if a massive commitment to finding searches for both a vaccine and cure for hiv are sustained for years to come
906696 ought to be eliminated entirely from the pantheon of threats to humanity
906697 the point i will make at the conference is that those statutes apart from their very broad and vague wording are very bad for the central issue of the epidemic which is getting treatment to people
906698 african health care systems were not ok before the aids epidemic and have become better after the opening of clinics
906699 there are now nearly 1 5 million kenyans living with the virus this is nothing less than a national crisis
906700 the only way to reverse this epidemic is through prevention
906701 we have made notable progress however hiv aids rates among our families and communities remains unacceptably high and the impact severe
906702 intensified action to move towards universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support
906703 although we have seen real progress in the last two years if we want to continue to see results we will need to see more financial resources and commitment
906704 are still five new infections for every two people who are newly added on treatment
906705 time to ramp up funding from all sources not to slow down or go on to other things
906706 were on the path toward victory here lets invest more
906707 not sure we will ever get to a point where we can say hiv aids is not a public health problem
906708 the songs sold in the music store are very high quality files protected by windows digital rights management drm technology which you can listen to using your computer and your mobile device
906709 world of warcraft has directx 7 class graphics and can run on any computer but at the end of the day consoles have definitely left pc games behind
906710 the biggest problem in this space right now is that you cannot go and design a game for a high end pc and downscale it to mainstream pcs the performance difference between high end and low end pc is something like 100x
906711 those damn mass market gamers must be blind for not demanding 64 bit hdr my business built on pushing more and more polygons to the screen every year is going bust must be those pc manufacturers not promoting the 3d accelerators enough
906712 through this intervention many of these children have been removed from dire situations of poverty and neglect
906713 too many people are still trapped in poverty with poor access to education services infrastructure water and sanitation
906714 we need to assist poor countries to train more health staff provide commensurate salaries to enable them to live better lives and carry out their work
906715 three million people globally have access to drugs but six million do not aids is far from over
906716 there is a need to expand treatment to those who do not yet have treatment
906717 these people are uncared for because of the terrain of the country and there are not enough resources to provide services
906718 you need healthcare workers to administer the drugs without healthcare workers drugs are useless
906719 average life expectancy in malawi has fallen from 62 to 39 mainly due to aids with fewer staff it also means that people with other diseases are also not being taken care of
906720 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
906721 one dutch was rescued by helicopter from k2 this morning while an italian is still at an altitude of 7 200m
906722 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
906723 the three mountaineers who survived are suffering from severe frostbite
906724 they are badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
906725 the rope collapsed and the climbers started falling in various directions some fell in neighbouring china some in pakistan
906726 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
906727 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300m cliff
906728 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
906729 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist
906730 i think they are cynical their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
906731 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
906732 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
906733 what we democrats cant afford to do even as we support senator obama is try to build one america on the cheap
906734 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
906735 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
906736 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
906737 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
906738 we warned folk to only deal with authorised ticket suppliers
906739 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
906740 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
906741 tutte le persone hanno due facce quella sorridente di quando va tutto bene e quella triste quando si diventa anche cattivi io preferisco il lato buono tante volte sono incavolato ma tengo questo stato danimo per me preferisco sorridere quando sto con gli altri non vuol dire che sono falso solo che non voglio far pesare sugli altri i miei problemi adesso sono col brasile e affronto lolimpiade sono qui per dare una mano agli amici a tentare unimpresa storica per i brasiliani che non hanno mai vinto loro olimpico e per farlo bisogna essere felici
906742 e stata unesperienza orribile per me e per la squadra prima del mondiale ero considerato quasi come pel dopo leliminazione ho sentito solo critiche che non avevo voglia di giocare che me nero andato a una festa dopo la partita nessuno che sia venuto a chiedermi come ti senti avrei risposto che ero triste che mi dispiaceva per quella sconfitta per non essere riuscito a dare alla mia nazione quello che avrei voluto invece sentii solo critiche che mi resero infelice ma ho imparato tantissimo
906743 e stato il periodo peggiore della mia vita ero infortunato non potevo allenarmi non potevo giocare lunica cosa che potevo fare era guardare la tv e pi guardavo le partite seduto su una poltrona pi diventavo triste non era mai successo che stessi fermo per cos tanto tempo non sapevo che fare per rimediare
906744 la mia famiglia mi ha protetto mi ha dato forza e ha anche sofferto perch le cattiverie non si sono fermate a me ma hanno coinvolto anche mio fratello roberto che anche mio agente lo hanno accusato di creare instabilit di stare vicino a me solo per i soldi e tante altre invenzioni con lunico scopo di farmi male ma siamo andati avanti io e la mia famiglia uno al fianco dellaltro
906745 quello che non capisco come sia possibile che fino a un certo giorno ero un esempio per tutti e che subito dopo ero diventato come maradona quando era al centro delle polemiche quando sono in vacanza faccio quello che voglio durante la stagione mi comporto da professionista serio non sgarro mai poi quando il campionato finito sono libero si tratta di momenti diversi non si possono mischiare le cose devi vivere bene sentirti felice se vuoi essere anche un buon atleta io faccio il massimo per essere un buon giocatore ma quando limpegno si concluso mi godo la vita
906746 no di sicuro ero gi in vacanza e mi arrivata la notizia di questa trattativa che era gi a buon punto sapevo dellinteresse di livorno pisa cittadella modena e treviso ma sono rientrato in fretta e ho subito firmato per il monaco prestito via milan con diritto di riscatto in favore dei monegaschi ndr loperazione andata in porto grazie a marco simone che gi mi conosceva a legnano e che qui a montecarlo ha sempre avuto ottimi rapporti inoltre durante la stagione sapevo che i dirigenti monegaschi mi avevano osservato diverse volte

906750 s ho parlato con il presidente che stata la prima persona conosciuta appena arrivato anche flavio roma mi ha parlato di quelle gare di champions lui infatti disput quella finale contro il porto
906751 s impressionante il club anche di tutto rispetto e glorioso per me unopportunit importante che spero di sfruttare al meglio forse sarebbe stato pi semplice andare a giocare in serie cadetta in italia visto che le richieste non mancavano ma sono giovane e voglio sfruttare questa grande opportunit di questa esperienza allestero

906755 the regulator needs powers to carry out a proper investigation on site not in letters
906756 vote national mortgage your children was the message in a nutshell
906757 what this means is that the public private partnerships that are the favoured format for delivering the think big projects that national has in mind will have to function to near perfection in order to fit within the extra 2 debt ratio parameters this is unlikely why because a key government is also planning to cut back its regulatory oversight of the economy just as the ppps will need to be highly and competently regulated in order to save taxpayers from being rorted by their big business project partners all up something like a 25 debt ratio seems a far more realistic figure in future this will add significantly a billion a year the labour green supporting standard website estimates to debt servicing costs in each successive year such costs alone will create a chronic pressure to cut social services
906758 kiwibank mainly targets more modest or low income people but it has actually been very competitive in what it does

907117 whether characters are legible or not depends on contrast that is the difference in brightness between the text and the background
907118 dark colors maintain the focus on the images bright colors can distract the eye and take the focus away from the images
907119 in short to avoid dazzling and prevent eyestrain your own or your users try to keep all surfaces at the same brightness by matching the overall brightness or dimness of your screens to the office environment if users typically use your software in brightly lit offices or if they type from bright source documents use light or off white backgrounds if your software is used in dim or dark areas air traffic control towe rs for example use dark backgrounds if you cant find out what the background will be you might want to include two backgrounds one light and one dark with your program

907138 je hoeft niet altijd te weten hoe je er komt zegt de zoon tegen zijn opa als hij de ladder naar de hemel voor hem tekent en blijft steken tussen de zon en de wolken een regel die staat als een huis
907139 een dichter die wars van grote woorden en avantgardisme een toegankelijke maar daarom niet minder subtiele en precieze po zie schreef die ook in de literaire kritiek op grote waardering mocht rekenen
907140 een positief zelfbeeld en zelfvertrouwen zijn de uitgangspunten voor een succesvolle persoonlijke ontwikkeling
907141 mental coaching is niets meer of minder dan het trainen van je gedachten van het idee dat gedachten kracht hebben raken gelukkig steeds meer mensen overtuigd dit bewustzijn alleen al doet veel echter is alleen dit bewustzijn onvoldoende om daadwerkelijk de positieve kracht van een positieve gedachte te gebruiken je moet er wel wat meer voor doen dat betekent oefenen trainen en doen in mijn boek de weg naar zelfvertrouwen en succes vindt men niet alleen veel psychologische achtergrondinformatie maar het boek dient ook als praktisch trainingsprogramma met stappenplannen om je doel te bereiken
907142 deze punten zijn de bases maar het allerbelangrijkste is het je bewust worden en zijn van je gedachten en de invloed die gedachten hebben op je hele zijn dan pas volgt stap twee het gebruiken van deze positieve gedachten om je doel te bereiken in het boek krijg je een trainingsprogramma mee dat erop gericht is om jezelf en anderen te coachen in persoonlijke ontwikkeling en negatieve gedachten te overwinnen
907143 bovenstaande punten zijn noodzakelijk om met mentale training te beginnen het eerlijk kijken naar jezelf is nog belangrijker dan het hebben van voldoende zelfvertrouwen ter verduidelijking wanneer iemand zichzelf geweldig vindt en bijvoorbeeld vindt dat hij zij altijd gelijk heeft en niet open staat voor mening van anderen kan deze persoon flink in de problemen komen wanneer hij zij kritiek krijgt dit hindert hen in relaties zeker wanneer er dan geen belletje gaat rinkelen en de persoon in kwestie stug blijft geloven in zijn eigen beeld zeker een positief zelfbeeld is het belangrijkste fundament van mentale training echter en dat is wat men vaak vergeet in de positieve trend van deze tijd is een eerlijk zelfbeeld nog belangrijker een positief zelfbeeld werkt alleen als je eerlijk naar jezelf durft te kijken als je dit niet kunt of aandurft kun je alle methodes uit de kast halen maar wie houd je dan uiteindelijk voor de gek
907144 ik erken onmiddellijk dat er al heel veel leesvoer en informatie is op dit gebied zelfontwikkeling en spirituele ontwikkeling zijn een trend van deze tijd gelukkig blijkt het ook van blijvende aard te zijn ik vind het inderdaad alleen maar positief door mijn interesse en werk heb ik mij dus lange tijd verdiept en ook gezocht naar kennis en ervaringen op spiritueel vlak dit omdat ik mij persoonlijk steeds verder wil ontwikkelen maar ook om iets meer mee te geven aan mijn studenten op het gebied van zelfontwikkeling dan rechtuit in alle boeken die ik las en trainingen die ik volgde miste ik een belangrijk punt de affirmatie het bevestigen van het te behalen resultaat dit aspect zo bemerkte ik tijdens het trainen en begeleiden van sporters is het belangrijkste van het te behalen doel eigenlijk gaat het allemaal om de volgende fases om je doel te bereiken 1 ontspan en laat alle negatieve gedachten los 2 concentreer je op een positieve gedachte 3 visualiseer het perfecte plaatje 4 bevestig het resultaat door hardop uit te spreken wat je doel is en op te schrijven wat je wilt bereiken doe deze affirmatie iedere dag minimaal drie weken achter elkaar train jezelf hierin het vergt veel geduld en discipline maar vooral het laatste punt de affirmatie is van een heel groot belang om je doel te bereiken
907145 veel mensen presteren onder de maat meestal als gevolg van negatieve invloeden en vergelijkingen die zij maken met de buitenwereld zij zijn heel erg kritisch naar zichzelf en te veeleisend deze gedachten ondermijnen het zelfvertrouwen sterk er komt ruimte voor negatief denken met mijn methode ondervang je een heleboel door eerlijk naar jezelf te kijken en je eigen beperkingen en mogelijkheden in te zien kun je ook daadwerkelijk uitgaan van je eigen talenten mijn methode is hierbij een handvat je kunt nooit altijd de winnaar zijn maar je kunt wel altijd persoonlijke doelen halen
907146 het geeft mij enorm veel voldoening om mensen te stimuleren te inspireren te enthousiasmeren en te coachen ik werk vooral graag in een groep mensen het is fantastisch om te zien hoe men in een team de gezamenlijke energie gaat benutten om er niet alleen zelf maar vooral ook samen beter van te worden vooral in de mental coaching cursussen die ik geef in het voor en najaar in koningshof in maassluis red zie ik dit in het groepsproces terug dat geeft mij wel een kick nee ik doe het niet alleen puur voor een ander of omdat ik nu zo nodig deze missie wil uitdragen in mijn leven ik doe het vooral omdat ik het zelf enorm leuk vind en het mij zoveel voldoening geeft wanneer ik mensen zie groeien

907149 vandaag op de deurmat werkelijk zeldzaam bijzonder dit een absolute sensatie die heel veel bundels overbodig maakt we gaan jan weerzien in

907151 wij waren verrast een oudere dichter bestijgt het podium colbertje kalend brildragende sympathieke veertiger vijftiger en begint me daar een potje te slammen wel met papier maar attenooie supergedicht over het chronologische verloop van een werkdag in perfecte beatpoetry hij ging ruim over de tijd onze jan maar ja het was n stuk jan kwam strak van de adrenaline van het podium af luid applaus en algehele verbaasde bewondering viel hem ten deel
907152 hij komt hij komt jan bais op zondag 6 april bij ons op het podium ik wil deze bundel maar snel bestellen en zit klaar bij de brievenbus
907153 die jan bais is een fascinerende dichter ik ben direct fan van hem geworden er is iets in zijn po tische systematiek dat heel precies het menselijk gevoel weet uit te drukken hem het gedicht zelfmoord voor horen dragen doet bijna pijn ik kreeg het helemaal koud in andere gedichten zit telkens die beetje cynische dan weer lekker kneuterige humor van hem ingebouwd een vriend van mij wil een videoclip gaan maken van een van jans gedichten wordt vervolgd jullie hebben een geweldige dichter aan de haak geslagen gefeliciteerd
907154 ik heb mond is spruitje gisteren gekocht in vlaardingen ik stond daar naast jan op de affiche en ik het is heel lang geleden dat ik nog zo verrast was over een dichterlijk experiment uit de lage landen dit is een boek om te koesteren waar we bij diverse po zieprijzen nog van zullen horen en zijn optreden was ook fantastisch
907155 ze leven nog allebei maar door de jaren heen heb ik ze in mijn fantasie op de meest afschuwelijke manieren ter dood gebracht met een bijl en een kettingzaag hakte en zaagde ik ze in stukken terwijl ze het uitgilden van de pijn en smeekten om genade

907164 in 2007 ncp sold around 150 000 ebooks this years sales contrary to the hopes and dreams of the truly evil are up around 25 since we have since our inception pretty much doubled in sales every year this is a low increase for us thus far this year but we put this down to the choking economy not evil wishes its difficult to get an exact figure on the customer base since many of our customers get a new customer number almost every time they visit but with those sales figures it should be easy to see that we have a pretty respectable customer base

907191 a drop from us 140 to us 123 a barrel has no impact on the domestic economies all it does is to moderate a little the surplus that the gulf has to save overseas
907192 the governments of the gcc have been saving significant amounts of money even at us 70 per barrel
907193 its not the level of oil but rather what the governments are going to do with the money that is important
907194 absolute claims which could be at risk of breaching the trade practices act if the fairtrade certification process was not 100 per cent reliable

907202 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now commonwealth securities economist savanth sebastian said
907203 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
907204 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight he said
907205 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
907206 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
907207 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
907208 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement

907212 the same sort of bureaucracy exists now that existed in the 1950s when the tests were going on in top secret

907215 door de aanleg van de cityring is er volgend jaar minder plaats voor attracties
907216 de tilburgse kermis moet juist groeien in plaats van inkrimpen en elke vijf jaar met iets nieuws komen
907217 het liefst breiden we de kermis uit tot aan de schouwburg op het plein kan een mooie blikvanger staan waarvan de lichtjes al vanuit de verte zichtbaar zijn
907218 we zijn daar te laat mee begonnen we hadden daar maanden eerder aan moeten gaan werken de luikse markt bestond dit keer slechts uit vier kramen er werden kaarsen hobbyspullen en kleding verkocht omdat de luikse markt pas om 14 00 uur begon waren enkele andere marktlieden die vroeger waren gekomen voor aanvang alweer vertrokken omdat ze dachten dat de markt de hele dag was de kermisattracties stonden veel dichter bij elkaar dan voorgaande keren vroeger zaten er te veel gaten in nu krijgen we alleen maar positieve reacties
907219 dat komt omdat er vorig jaar tien attracties stonden en nu vijftien

907241 the abject silence on the part of the canadian arab federation in the face of vitriolic attacks on jews by muslim perpetrators is tantamount to tacit approval of anti semitism and gives a green light to others who would entertain the notion of attacking jews
907242 taj approached the group of teenagers around 10 45 pm and asked whos jewish
907243 he then slapped her in the face and pullled her hair before her friends jessica motta kayla hungle and daniel ball attempted to intervene
907244 the canadian arab federation has not only not uttered one word of condemnation for this horrific attack but they have remained silent in the face of arson attacks in canada directed against shuls and jewish community centers and violent attacks on jewish students on local university campuses
907245 a jewish camp in northern ontario was attacked no one was hurt but property was smashed and tires slashed sending a clear message the camp staff was told by the town that jews were no longer welcome in their stores
907246 jewish businesses in canada are picketed by groups supported by the caf claiming these businesses support israeli apartheid
907247 making a strong case that it is every bit as radical and unhinged
907248 recent sponsorship of an essay contest on the ethnic cleansing of palestine in which it urged high school students to channel the groups own fervid hatred of israel for prizes
907249 under the guise of islamophobia the caf is promulgating hatred for jews in a fashion similar to that of the nazis during world war ii just as the nazis accused worldwide jewry of maintaining a secret cabal with the intent of dominating and oppressing the poor and downtrodden germans so too is the caf actively working to promote the fallacious and patently ridiculous claim that the jews run the world while muslims represent a powerless minority even though there are 1 4 billion muslims in the world and only 13 5 million jews
907250 a fully paid up member of the anglo saxon mafia
907251 muhammed is the messenger of allah and those who are with him are harsh towards the kuffar and compassionate towards each other
907252 it is the ideology of the muslim brotherhood that justifies and promotes attacks on jews in canada
907253 some kind of form must be signed that prohibits entry into canada of people that believe in the muslim brotherhood ideology this would make it possible to conduct denaturalization and deportation proceedings
907254 our major concern is the safety of jews in our community and to that end we the jdl are offering security training to the community we will not just train anyone the jdl is not seeking a confrontation with adversarial forces but because of the level of violence and intimidation against the jewish community it is important to teach jews how to defend themselves should a situation arise

907258 the uygurs have been hunted and pushed back on every front it is impossible for them to plan and carry out terrorist attacks in the remote city of kunming
907259 the us congress will pass a motion next week condemning chinas crackdown on uygurs and the congress will ask us president george w bush to raise the issue with chinese leaders
907260 the release of this videotape hands the initiative back to the chinese government claims of terrorist attacks by uygurs is what they wanted most we suspect the video could well have been ordered by wang lequan the top official in xinjiang he has long been using anti terrorist campaigns to consolidate his own power
907261 they are all only mobs separated by different interests and splinter groups
907262 we are not against ordinary han people we are just fighting against the regime

907266 the us congress will pass a motion next week condemning chinas crackdown on uygurs and the congress will ask us president george w bush to raise the issue with chinese leaders
907267 in order to pressure the uyghurs and occupy their oil resources the chinese concocted a story of etim and al qaeda
907268 spec i find it a good habit to do a bit of a background check on such authors in order to establish what song they re singing too christoffersen works for the center for contemporary conflict ccc an american think tank created by the u s naval postgraduate schools department of national security affairs where the pursuit of knowledge is seconded to supporting us foreign policy authors like her write to an agenda in 2002 the u s were very keen to have chinas support for their war on terror and it was also the same year the u s named etim as a terrorist organisation xinjiang was in the u s policy markers orbit unfortunately it was all about proving xinjiang had a terrorist problem truth became skewered other xinjiang authors i tend to take with a pinch of salt are martin wayne and elizabeth van wei davis it s all star spangled banners unfortunately
907269 most chinese people are credulous they trust the media without even a little doubt
907270 god i hate black people except their babies which i love to rape

907273 that connection isnt molded yet but it will i believe it will i think its important to our secondary and to our defense as a whole not just him and me as individual players to be on the same page dwight and i we used to bring the whole entire cornerback position into our house and watch film together coye and i are looking forward to doing that this year for our teams success
907274 we have a lot of new guys and the personnel will be a little different but i believe from what i saw this off season in seven on sevens and the connections we had in the weight room that we will be alright that first game will be a challenge for us to mold and get used to playing with each other matt castelo and i played together for three years so that made things easy its going to be a challenge this season of course but im looking forward to it the challenge is what makes this a good season and what gets me excited we will use that as our fuel
907275 it can be like coach tomey said we are optimistic kevin jurovich gilly jarron gilbert and myself weve been here since before coach tomey so weve seen the program when coach fitz hill was here and weve seen the progress it has made we are excited about that and we are excited to be leaders on this team we are going to do whatever we have to do for us to have a winning season
907276 it was a learning experience especially for the young players they dont know how tough it is to get through an entire season its really tough they cant really understand that until they play an entire season once they do that were going to take care of each other more and continue to practice it is imperative that we do stay healthy
907277 were put a lot of work in this off season and come august when camp starts we expect to be putting in a lot of extra time as much work in as we can we are going to go into the season confident every day in practice be optimistic and expect to do our best every game regardless of what the outcome is
907278 the scheme we have now with defensive coordinator coach keith burns coaching it is a more aggressive defense the players we have are great this is the most talented group of guys that ive been around youre not going to replace matt castelo dwight lowery or adam tafralis some of the things they brought to the game were great for us but the guys we have coming in are tremendous i cant wait to get it started
907279 its a little bit of a change but i like it being inside i can use my athleticism to my advantage
907280 it feels great honestly its the best group of guys that ive been able to work with in my four years this is the best line that we have had since i have been here

907450 ausdr cklich begr t der fahrgastverband pro bahn jedoch dass die deutsche bahn ag erstmals offiziell ank ndigt die h lfte der heute rund 180r intercity z ge durch neue intercity fahrzeuge ersetzen zu wollen die aktuelle gesch ftspolitik der db dr ngt aber den eindruck auf dass diese z ge bevorzugt im auslandsverkehr eingesetzt werden sollen anders k nnen wir nicht erkl ren dass die db bereits im dezember dieses jahres erneut inl ndische intercity verbindungen und schw cher nachgefragte ice verbindungen streichen will
907451 man muss diese ma nahmen mit der lupe in den unterlagen der db suchen
907452 oft erfahren fahrg ste erst aus dem abfahrtsplan dass ihr zug nicht mehr f hrt
907453 halle und magdeburg sind am wochenende bis zu 18 stunden lang nicht mit einem fernzug erreichbar von hannover nach emden fahren t glich nur noch drei intercity z ge nach trier vor 13 uhr nur noch einer auf linien auf denen die db nicht einmal konkurrenz durch vergleichbare regionalz ge hat wie zwischen erfurt und d sseldorf streicht die db bei jedem fahrplanwechsel ein weiteres zugpaar
907454 deshalb hat der fahrgastverband pro bahn bereits gespr che mit dem db vorstand aufgenommen die auch konstruktiv verlaufen die db muss ein konzept finden wie fernverkehrsz ge mit hundert oder hundertf nfzig reisenden noch angeboten werden k nnen bis jetzt reagiert die db nur mit zugstreichungen mit der jetzt angek ndigten bestellung von langen intercity wagenz gen ist das problem nicht zu l sen
907455 linien nach amsterdam warschau krakau prag wien graz und verona brauchen dringend moderne fahrzeuge und bringen mehr einnahmen als inlandsverbindungen
907456 ice z ge hat die db bereits systematisch aus dem inlandsverkehr abgezogen ice z ge die fr her zwischen d sseldorf und erfurt fuhren verkehren jetzt nach wien und diesel ice die f r die verbindung n rnberg dresden gebaut wurden fahren jetzt nach kopenhagen wenn ab dezember mehr intercity z ge nach amsterdam fahren verliert die universit tsstadt m nster gleichzeitig die direktverbindung nach berlin wir begr en jede verbesserung des auslandsverkehrs und die zusammenarbeit mit den bahnen der nachbarl nder aber das darf nicht zu lasten der innerdeutschen verbindungen gehen
907457 die deutsche bahn ag ist nicht dem gemeinwohl verpflichtet sondern der rendite das ist ihr auftrag seit der bahnreform 1994 und es ist der db auch nicht vorzuwerfen dass sie danach handelt
907458 an vielen stellen des bundesgebiets k mpfen st dte und regionen um den erhalt ihrer fernverkehrsverbindungen meistens ohne erfolg wenn die db ein glaubw rdiger partner der reisenden und der regionen sein will dann muss sie als erstes die angek ndigten zugstreichungen zur cknehmen und mit anderen strategien als der ausd nnung des fahrplans auf die anforderungen des marktes reagieren 100 und mehr reisende in einem zug sind etwas anderes als keine nachfrage
907459 how the heck do you lose your most important document i asked myself

907462 okay no email today if you want something go talk to that person ftf
907463 do rfa know today is the twenty anniversary of uss vincennse shooting down of an iranian pasengger plane killing two hundred civilians including 60 young children aboard the airbus those who refuse to read history will repeat the mistake and mistake will have a price to be paid when its time is due
907464 the u s has a long history of sailing into iranian waters and otherwise provoking iran
907465 remember on july 3 1988 the uss vincennes shot down an unarmed iranian passenger plane and the u s tried to cover up the incident in that context the u s version of events must be carefully examined it seems highly unlikely that iran planned to blow up u s naval ships and precipitate a major incident or even war if the u s attempts to make propaganda points based on the incident it will reflect a new truculence coming out of washington
907466 china too big to be bullied too smart to be manipulated
907467 the international situation and the political environment is becoming increasingly complicated by the day and the dark clouds of terrorism on our borders is a fact that cannot be ignored
907468 as the host nation we are faced with unprecedented pressure and a huge responsibility
907469 they even stopped going to the monasteries to spin prayer wheels and chant sutras a fact that tells us that the dalai lama is the real criminal who is destroying tibetan buddhism we must learn lessons from this issue and organise our masses to build up an impregnable fortress against the tide of encirclement to beat our enemy
907470 but we are far from final victory because the dalai lama group which was exploited by western enemy forces is making a new plan for separatism
907471 so you the leaders of work units must guard your gates and manage your people well let leaders of street committees be vigilant and keep watch on all outsiders
907472 propaganda and education are our partys greatest advantages these are the most useful weapons with which to defend ourselves against the dalai lama group so let the propaganda department work more actively to expose its plots
907473 each department should make full use of those religious people who love the motherland and love religion in order to make the administrative committees work with vigour
907474 we must clean out the monasteries and strengthen the administrative committees
907475 a wolf in monks clothes a devil with a human face
907476 how does this little country with so little talent keep its ruling party in place and run a tight ship honest and effective and make progres
907477 who are they have they ever run a country created jobs for community and given them a life we have and we know what it requires
907478 especially as the beijing olympic games draw near a range of anti china forces and hostile forces are striving by any means and redoubling efforts to engage in trouble making and sabotage
907479 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
907480 a safe olympics is also the biggest indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
907481 the more china wants to show hospitality the more it should pay attention to security issues
907482 it was not a good thing what the chinese did
907483 but this case might be caused by social conflict or some individuals who have some extreme ideas
907484 terrorists always like to turn to regions or cities where the preventive measures are weak
907485 and we all know america ever had a critical period of racism problems could you please tell us what the american gov supposed to do when facing such a situation what would it choose
907486 how come when i studied in australia new zealand i never go to probe these minorities amp their grievance against their majority white caucasian masters like what you do
907487 what will be really going backwards just imageine after the tibet riots in march if it were during the maos time i can assure you all those monasteries would already been torn down and burned
907488 to be sure a harmonious is something to strive for
907489 btw any body know anything about the terorists just busted in shanghai
907490 we have obtained information that international terrorist organisations would likely launch an attack against an olympic venue in the city during the games
907491 international terrorist forces are itching to strike with terror attacks against the beijing games and hostile domestic forces disruption and sabotage activities against the games are steadily unfolding
907492 white settlers did more atrocious things to these people than what we did to our minorities but they were never reported as such as you guys are controlling the world opinions amp narratives
907493 a side note during the cultural revolution most damages in tibet such as those targeted towards the monasteries were carried out by tibetan youth themselves not han chinese youth perhaps you should read more history about that period lol
907494 of course i passed my phd with 1st class honours beating all the white folks who only know how to root eat amp booze so to speak love to study in enemy countries because it is nice to excel in the enemies languages
907495 btw we at least enrich amp empower these poor souls amp pull them out of their pathetic ignorance amp poverty
907496 as china s propaganda machines never miss a beat in the former chinas progress i am quite happy to pick up the slack in areas of the latter civil and political rights
907497 there will be no progress on any endeavor if you dont have the freedom of criticism and debate of differing opinions
907498 never argue with an idiot they will bring you down to their level and then beat you with experience
907499 vandaag op de deurmat werkelijk zeldzaam bijzonder dit een absolute sensatie die heel veel bundels overbodig maakt we gaan jan weerzien in
907500 wars van personalistische po zie laat hij zijn publiek opveren en zorgt hij voor ongekende hilariteit in oplopend tempo mitrailleert hij zijn geautomatiseerde po zie een beschrijving per seconde van een dag uit het leven van de gemiddelde belastingbetaler razendsnel je raakt zelfs als luisteraar buiten adem
907501 wij waren verrast een oudere dichter bestijgt het podium colbertje kalend brildragende sympathieke veertiger vijftiger en begint me daar een potje te slammen wel met papier maar attenooie supergedicht over het chronologische verloop van een werkdag in perfecte beatpoetry hij ging ruim over de tijd onze jan maar ja het was n stuk jan kwam strak van de adrenaline van het podium af luid applaus en algehele verbaasde bewondering viel hem ten deel
907502 hij komt hij komt jan bais op zondag 6 april bij ons op het podium ik wil deze bundel maar snel bestellen en zit klaar bij de brievenbus
907503 die jan bais is een fascinerende dichter ik ben direct fan van jan geworden er is iets in zijn po tische systematiek die heel precies het menselijk gevoel weet uit te drukken hem het gedicht zelfmoord voor horen dragen doet bijna pijn ik kreeg het helemaal koud in andere gedichten zit telkens die beetje cynische dan weer lekker kneuterige humor van hem ingebouwd een vriend van mij wil een videoclip gaan maken van een van jans gedichten wordt vervolgd jullie hebben een geweldige dichter aan de haak geslagen gefeliciteerd
907504 ik heb mond is spruitje gisteren gekocht in vlaardingen ik stond daar naast jan op de affiche en ik het is heel lang geleden dat ik nog zo verrast was over een dichterlijk experiment uit de lage landen dit is een boek om te koesteren waar we bij diverse po zieprijzen nog van zullen horen en zijn optreden was ook fantastisch
907505 door het schrijven van gedichten probeer ik de essentie van wat ik om mij heen zie gebeuren in taal te vatten
907506 ive been to china ten times i never had problems getting a visa before im going to be entering through kazakhstan but leaving by plane dont you know that there are valid land crossings into china
907507 not as much trouble as chinese people have getting a us visa
907508 hey take a look at yourself in the mirror sheesh
907509 i dont feel angry i dont have any bitterness at the end of the day youre still a guest of someone elses country its just sobering
907510 illegal gatherings processions demonstrations and failure to comply can result in fines or legal punishment
907511 i was really looking forward to a phenomenal year and that has slowly been tempered by the visa restrictions
907512 may and june have been tough months july will also be a tough month before the olympics
907513 the four star and three star market has perhaps more than 50 of the rooms available
907514 its really a hassle and adds a lot of time and expense
907515 nothing is insurmountable but it increases the cost of business and makes people think twice before going in
907516 our interest is that things go back where they were before after olympics
907517 i was so happy and so excited after three months of so much stress
907518 do what is correct file the paperwork and get the right visa
907519 kick the illegal aliens out i had to go through the process they should too
907520 heck with it they dont want us here anyway i
907521 dont put down roots or invest in anything you cant walk away from keep your suitcase packed and your passport in your pocket and a thousand bucks in your briefcase the government could change at any second and kick us out maybe coming true at least we all feel that way now
907522 one scientist goverdhan mehta the former director of the indian institute of science in bangalore went for a routine visa interview at the consulate on feb 9 only to be questioned about whether his research could be used for chemical warfare speaking thursday from his home in bangalore he said it could not he said he remembered being told he was not being honest
907523 from the chinese perspective the issue is simple on the basis of interviews lasting less than five minutes thousands of chinese this year have found their longstanding plans for study travel or work jettisoned those denied visas include students with full scholarships to ivy league schools and grandparents wanting to see a first grandchild
907524 something about the whole procedure was demeaning the couple suggested with an air of chekhovian world weariness what has given the complaint an edge is that poland is a major supporter of the american occupation of iraq and has sent 2 400 troops there but for those who are refused the experience acquires shades of humiliation they treat you like animals complained arkadiusz dmochowski a 23 year old student who was waiting outside for his fianc e to complete her interview
907525 these perverts who couldnt get laid back home in rural america come to asia bc now they are mister exotic westerner these perverts are the same deadbeat foreigners im talking about arrogant western men who think they are gods gift
907526 we are perverts who couldnt get laid in rural america
907527 these perverts who disrespect women exploit the developing world they prance around disrespecting the culture and people
907528 and the thing about white boys are the minute you insult them they bring out some sexual insult which is what black men have levied at them in their hometowns so now they feel its their turn
907529 now i did it with you i can never fall into a chinese mans arms again
907530 you are the exact type of foreigner that give the legitimate foreigners a bad name and its safe to say i think most chinese are happy these drunken perverts who run around the entertainment districts causing trouble and noise are sent home
907531 when 500 000 americans are living and working illegally in china no visa at all illegally then come back and complain about how difficult the us process is for chinese
907532 if some mexican immigrant went to america and started blogging and talking about the
907533 chinese girls mostly go with western guys bc they want green cards and to learn english not bc your a stallion there big jun
907534 its difficult for chinese to get visas to the us so china has every right to do the same to americans
907535 im working for a huge state owned behemoth that should have no trouble getting visas
907536 while the us visa officers can often be irritating you often run into individual officers willing to make decisions go out on a limb and help applicants that seems to never be the case with chinese visa officers all of whom are afraid to stick their neck out or help anyone
907537 if some mexican immigrant went to america and started blogging and talking about the
907538 i like redneck bumper sticker usa love it or leave it
907539 all they want to do is milk the land dry of profit and give nothing back but their ersatz modernity
907540 china has had sovereignty over xinjiang for over a thousand years
907541 save your separatists propaganda for the uneducated people that you socialize with on the weekends
907542 china has had sovereignty over xinjiang sic for over a thousand years
907543 the suspects confessed they had all received training on the launching of a holy war
907544 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
907545 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
907546 the number of criminal cases dropped 12 6 percent compared with the same period last year
907547 the second phase has begun all police must continue to work hard and increase the fight against terrorism the three evil forces criminal cases drug crimes and other violent crimes so as to provide solid work for the olympic security and ensure the stability of the regional capital
907548 dichten kwam pas laat in mijn leven maar wel vanzelf zonder dat ik daar bewust naar streefde naast tekenen en schilderen als creatieve uiting voor mijn fantasie heb ik het dichten ontdekt als een inspirerend spel met taal als een unieke opwindende mogelijkheid om een eigen werkelijkheid te scheppen en om daarin te reizen behalve reizen vormt geschiedenis voor mij een voortdurende bron van inspiratie waarbij jeugdherinneringen van tijd tot tijd vragen om een nieuwe aankleding in woorden
907549 it is almost as though the tibetans are diverting their anger over their own situation towards another vulnerable minority
907550 to be honest the tibetans dont have the business savvy of the hui the tibetans have to sell their products to hui the hui have to buy from the tibetans
907551 i suppose because we are interdependent we resent each other
907552 we saw what happened on television after that i sent away my children from here i fear for their safety
907553 what is happening now is that you have all this transient population people are migrating here and there and coming into more and more day to day contact in the past they werent allowed to trespass into each others territory and you had no ethnic conflict
907554 you hear all these stories about muslims putting stuff in the soup but i think it is all about business competition and economics
907555 they think the dalai lama is their leader but how is independence possible
907556 with the country developing so fast life is good people have enough to eat they have clothes
907557 they use us as a scapegoat for their grievances against the country
907558 tungganlar xitayni k rse x yimiz bir uyghurni k rse dinimiz bir deydu
907559 huis say we wear similar shoes when they see han chinese but when they see uyghurs they say we are religious brethren
907560 tungganlar xitayni k rse x yimiz bir uyghurni k rse dinimiz bir deydu
907561 huis say we wear similar shoes when they see han chinese
907562 if han stands aside there would be a big ethnic war going on with all hell broken
907563 huis say we wear similar shoes when they see han chinese
907564 we i e hui and han chinese wear similar shoes
907565 belief among some uyghurs that huis are more obsequious toward the han and have a flip flop character
907566 also this issue of the prc and han nation is blurred by you
907567 multi ethnicity is better looked upon as foreigners ruling han rather than han and other ethnic groups all getting along harmoniously together
907568 how far back does one have to go to find a centrally governed
907569 yours is basically an official prc version of the one big hapy family tale
907570 roebuck you are actually pretty humorous for an ardent supporter of osama bin laden
907571 there were a lot of fightings between huis who are not ethnic han as this article claimed but rather arabs and persians who came alone with mongol
907572 when mongol conquered china some thousand years ago many han converted themselves to muslim to avoid racial discrimination of yuan
907573 in fact roc of kmt didnt officially recognize hui as an ethnic
907574 dont confuse prc with a han state even though prcs population is predominantly han its a multi ethnic state a legacy of qing empire
907575 a genome based study of the muslim hui community and the han population of liaoning province pr china
907576 also since northern han chinese are fully of hu bloods central asian turkic
907577 mummies that astonishing thing is without revealing the source of the mummies just by looking at dna evidence alone its easy to conclude that the sample come from a modern cosmopolitan city with diverse populations
907578 difficult to make valid comparisons of the chinese as a group with other ethnic groups
907579 toute sa vie il adore les enfants et vient en aide ceux qui sont dans le besoin organisant des galas au moulin rouge ou de la galette
907580 il avait sans cesse la main la poche raconte roland dorgel s aux petits il donnait pour sacheter des bille s des sucres dorge du roudoudou parfois des chaussures aux grands de quoi r gler l picier qui coupait le cr dit
907581 terrorists are within the country not without therefore these people were not terrorists but freedom fighters is logical
907582 frankly speaking these people live to create problem to the nature and the world its a waste of resources to have such people around these unsophisticated groups is every things we know as satan they lie they spill blood they use double standard everywhere everytime they dont give a shit saying all man are born equal and yet happily keep slave at home
907583 an ad hominem argument also known as argumentum ad hominem latin
907584 um here in the civilized west we no longer use such racist terms is that what you han call those who arent yellow or white so archaic
907585 nigga please you look like you just came out of the thrift store with yo cheap ass yo mom was a poor white trash hooker and you look straight up retarded crazy fuckin crackass think they can talk down to us like that
907586 china has sacked a number of government officials and arrested a man in connection with a set of fake photographs that local authorities had said was proof of the existence of a highly endangered tiger in october forestry officials in zhenping county in northern shaanxi province published photos of a tiger in a forest setting saying they were proof of the existence of the south china tiger a local farmer who produced the photos was paid a 20 000 yuan 3000 reward nine months later officials admitted the photos were faked state media said citing sources at a press conference held by the shaanxi province government thirteen local officials including zhu julong deputy head of the provinces forestry bureau and its top wildlife official wang wanyun were sacked xinhua said zhou zhenglong the farmer who claimed to have taken the photo using a digital camera was arrested on suspicion of fraud xinhua said after police seized a picture of a tiger which he borrowed from a farmer in another village to produce the photos the scandal has captivated local media and many chinese who have viewed the saga as symbolic of common peoples lack of trust in local authorities china has been rocked by a number of major scandals involving official endorsement of photos of rare wildlife in recent years in february the chief editor of a chinese newspaper quit after one its photographers faked a prize winning photo of endangered tibetan antelopes appearing unfazed by a passing train on the qinghai tibet railway
907587 held invalid a decision of a combatant status review tribunal
907588 affiliated with forces associated with al qaeda and the taliban
907589 no source document evidence was introduced to indicate that the detainee had actually joined etim
907590 which no doubt ranged from orphanages to terrorist organizations like al qaeda
907591 associated with the taliban in a sense that would make them enemy combatants
907592 as having reportedly occurred as being said to or reported to have happened and as things that may be true or are suspected of having taken place but in virtually every instance the documents do not say who reported or said or suspected those things because of those omissions the tribunal could not and this court cannot assess the reliability of the assertions in the documents and because of this deficiency those bare assertions cannot sustain the determination that parhat is an enemy combatant
907593 expeditiously hold a new tribunal consistent with the courts opinion
907594 multiple offers coming in on properties under 300 000 it certainly sounds great and it is true but reality is that its on bank owned properties with extremely low asking prices that is creating all of the attention and the multiple offers that you may be reading about
907595 this market has got to be one of the most confusing and frustrating for buyers
907596 whats going on my full price offer sat around for 3 weeks and the home was sold to someone else for 40k over list
907597 i can no more walk away from him than i can walk away from the black community
907598 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
907599 damit wollten sich die amerikaner bedanken dass sie in der
907600 my mom even helped me put it on the computer i wanted to put it online so she helped me put it online i have it on my myspace too but i dont like to put my name online so i put it under author unknown
907601 wie kann man so bl d sein und sich um ungelegte eier gedanken machen
907602 wir opfern die gef hle so gern wenn uns ein gro es ziel vor augen steht
907603 this project is aimed at increasing broadband coverage in the klang valley to 90 percent of the population by 2010
907604 this project will raise the quality of city halls service delivery reduce installation costs help automate and coordinate in a systematic manner the work processes improve productivity and overall propel the e government initiative
907605 corporations are selling us back our ideas innovations and visions for an exorbitant price i want them all back and i want them now
907606 no great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought
907607 but unmanageable we have taken some of the good stuff form that and included it as extra functionality in our vle
907608 die sch ne aussicht von der terrasse wird bald jemand anders genie en k nnen
907609 es ndert sich merklich was leuten beim kauf eines hauses wichtig ist
907610 when i called before in may i was concerned that my materials had been lost in the mail so i had you look for them at that time you told me that you had them in front of you
907611 oh are you mrs bees i have your materials here they havent been processed yet
907612 yeah it looks like i just reviewed them yesterday we havent processed it into a folder yet
907613 i was told they would have been reviewed and processed three weeks ago
907614 ha ha yeah that was probably wishful thinking on my part if i told you that they would be evaluated in a week
907615 well ill go ahead and i guess i can go ahead and schedule you for the screening interview now though can you can you come in monday
907616 oh well we dont have any afternoon interviews at all
907617 god im embarrassed that china gives so much praise to worthless foreigners you think american tv would ever put chinese expats on their shows
907618 so i say to my fellow chinese lets start treating foreigners how western countries treat us
907619 it stank of minority tokenism the dance itself displayed such awe and admiration of the torch it gave me a sense of an almost sexual fetishization
907620 the posts above yours reek of typical han fetishization of uyghur women
907621 nobody is allowed to watch the torch relay tomorrow unless you are being organised by your work unit i feel a lot of regret
907622 the police are coming to my house tonight to inspect it and to register everybody living there
907623 we expect so many people to come we thought it would be easier this way
907624 uyghur and tibetan have super human rights the preferential treatment of uyghur and tibetan is the abuse of the han
907625 were here to assume and resume what is already ours and what has always been ours
907626 we are definitely trying to correct a wrong that we feel has been done to us as a people
907627 as long as they comply with the permit conditions they may continue to request permits to meet
907628 the essence of sovereignty under international law is people living on their land and asserting their rights and thats what the native hawaiians are doing theyve made a lot of progress
907629 theres got to be a legal way in which to try to get these issues resolved
907630 its far easier to put the kibosh on someone than to lift it
907631 were in a period where chinas influence is expanding and theyre seeking ways to control the message outside of china just as they do inside china
907632 people who do research in the country want continuing access there is a tendency not to do anything that will threaten your ability to get access
907633 the chinese government likes to set rules in peoples minds
907634 theres a line you are not supposed to cross there are certain things you dont do or say as long as you observe these rules you wont have a problem
907635 this effect is hard to pin down and to measure because it operates deep in the privacy of individual minds where even the user himself or herself might not always be aware of it
907636 i am pretty sure that my example lurks in the minds of people in the field
907637 its not polemical we dont address human rights issues directly and we certainly didnt support a separatist cause
907638 i have seen chinese and foreign scholars who are brilliant but when they make a speech they have a different view than when they speak privately
907639 when a group of scholars studying xinjiang are all blacklisted and they can no longer go to xinjiang and can no longer attend conferences in china on any topic then learning in that field and by scholars in any field is less than it would otherwise be
907640 that is a heavy penalty and so you stop saying things you dont want to say and you stop doing research you know is sensitive
907641 if a journalist gets kicked out of china he can always go to tel aviv but not if youre an academic
907642 even students with relatively innocuous topics like the state mandated village elections come to me asking how they can avoid trouble if they take on such a topic
907643 your work always makes some chinese hostage to your behaviour and i dont want to get people in trouble
907644 theres a sort of damocles sword hanging above your head and you are aware of it all the time
907645 the way it works is if the sword falls the question is why was your neck stretched out rather than why did the sword fall
907646 if you look at it in a cold way china needs the west more than the west needs china
907647 there is a lot more bargaining power on the us side than on the chinese side
907648 millward has written on the reverse orientalism of the han towards the xinjiang oasis dwellers now known as uyghur
907649 a uyghur muslim in qianlongs court the meanings of the fragrant concubine
907650 they are afraid people might travel abroad and join some sort of plot against the olympics
907651 the crackdown is intended to prevent uighurs from telling foreign reporters and visitors the truth of their suffering
907652 the chinese communists have enslaved the uighurs politically the uighurs have lost all rights
907653 the olympic torch has never been to our city we are very proud
907654 considering that too many people will cause a lack of safety we are recommending that everyone watches on the television from home
907655 the government expects tens of thousands of people will shout encouragement on the streets who have come in groups with their work units
907656 i heard that they are going to run the torch tomorrow but i dont know any other details
907657 do not shout slogans that damage the image of the nation or of the city
907658 if foreign reporters cover a sudden incident they will be subject to site safety management instructions and should follow the advice of security personnel on the spot
907659 uighurs are still living in a culture of fear facing persecution marginalisation and assimilation that erode the very core of cultural identity religious belief and economic rights of uighurs
907660 and to borrow from you you are one of these quarter educated know it all westerner who feels they are on some holy mission to bring freedom to poor colored people you interpret any chinese person who criticizes the west or displays any defense of china as someone who is a brainwashed fascist my question to you is what made you such a flaming china hating racist sino phobe ps its normal for us chinese to master a second language quite easily where as westerners who live here for ten years probably can only muster out and it will probably take them an additional ten years for them to read these characters
907661 what does it have to do with us that is chinas olympics we dont care
907662 uighurs are living in a culture of fear facing persecution marginalisation and assimilation that erode the very core of their cultural identity religious belief and economic rights
907663 they lack the education and a general world view to understand anything other than the propoganda sic thats fed to them
907664 you dont know what the white have done to our people
907665 chinese history is not a history in modern context it is only historical material
907666 incidentally russian word for china kitay derive from khitan which russians took from mongols it became cathay in english and survives as the name of some hong kong airline
907667 but of course it is prohibited in public by chinese regime
907668 presumably after yelu dashi imposed his rule on uyghurs of kara khanid khanate western liao or kara khitan khanate under yelu dashi gave quite a bloody nose to seljuk turk where sanjar the last great hope of seljuk empire was thoroughly defeated yelu dashi was a distinguished confucian scholar well versed in chinese culture
907669 was a distinguished confucian scholar well versed in chinese culture
907670 how the heck is the chinese regime gonna ban use of
907671 when your cadres first arrived et in the 50s learning uyghur language was sort of obligatory it is not anymore and you know the reason
907672 its this nestorian christian turkic prince who prosecute his muslim subject forcing conversion into either buddhism his khitan wifes religion or christianity this was the major reason uyghurs embrace genghis khan as liberator uyghurs willingly went under the genghis khans banner
907673 rightio ill stick to hr and you stick to historical revisionism
907674 two dutch climbers were brought by our people and their colleagues down to base camp from an altitude of 7 300 metres overnight
907675 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
907676 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
907677 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
907678 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
907679 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
907680 i was terrified that the pakistani would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
907681 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
907682 meltdown the inside story of the north korean nuclear crisis
907683 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
907684 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
907685 but the combination of internal politics and media generalization created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
907686 they wanted to use this as a flaming red star cluster into the sky that the north koreans cheated abrogated the agreed framework we always told you this was a bad idea
907687 there is an irony here that the hardliners attempt to pressure the north koreans to give up the bomb in fact created circumstances where the north became a nuclear power and made the whole process of undoing their nuclear program much much harder than had they adopted a similar approach at the beginning
907688 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
907689 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
907690 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
907691 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
907692 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema
907693 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
907694 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
907695 president bush has been working with the iraqis to encourage them to work out their differences and get the provincial elections law passed
907696 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
907697 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
907698 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
907699 no rules so we could do the best and most compelling approaches
907700 clearly the most expensive case fbis ever undertaken and the most scientifically compelling case
907701 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
907702 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
907703 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
907704 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straightaway that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
907705 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
907706 los juegos de los partidos pol ticos no son democracia
907707 ya allah kau perkuatkanlah hati2 kami moga kami bisa menjadi penegak agamamu dalam dunia penuh dugaan ini ameen
907708 there are over 100 members of etim that were trained by al qaeda in afghanistan prior to the invasion of afghanistan so there is no question about the links the links are very strong
907709 there is no doubt that the biggest threat facing the olympics is terrorism
907710 we need to meet the challenges from the terrorist groups separatist groups and extremist groups
907711 we must be prepared for the possibility that al qaeda or some other terrorist group will attempt to launch a deadly terrorist attack at these olympics
907712 i think that china is a very difficult operating environment and terrorists will generally choose an area where it s less difficult to operate
907713 al qaeda has changed from the days when they actually did operations to now being more reliant on local groups doing things which are consistent with what al qaeda would like
907714 if you claim that a problematic element within your society has got links to al qaeda of course it does give you a tick in the box and get a bit more sympathy internationally for you
907715 with the formation of the shanghai five a security group formed in 1996 by china russia and central asian states now called the shanghai cooperation organisation and the ousting of the taliban from afghanistan these places were no longer viable bases for uyghur militants and my belief is that any organised uyghur armed movement ended then
907716 journalists and academics working there are placed under tight scrutiny and uyghurs in xinjiang place themselves at significant risk by talking politics to foreigners
907717 convincing the outside world that china faced a real terrorist threat was a credible defence for pursuing harsh policies against uyghur and tibetan nationalism
907718 we are currently experiencing reasonable growth in our prescription drug business in china
907719 astrazeneca started a few years ago a little bit earlier than novartis
907720 there is a type of war for capturing talent for developing talent for attracting talent
907721 this is one of the greatest challenges that the general managers in china are facing
907722 the people who lose are terrorists the people who win are freedom fighters funny how that always works out
907723 by the way al queda was working with cia in the 80s everybody knew that it is not a secret washington support uighur terrorist they even give them an office washington dc
907724 so us is going to harbor uyghurs who pose threat to china great chinese government should take note maybe its time to provide safe harbor to people who pose threat to united states but not china life is a two way street
907725 let xinjiang and rest of china be a transit point for afghan opium is a bad idea rare are the transit countries not have some kind of drug law enforcement problem
907726 it is china who needs terrorism in xinjiang more than the uighur separatists do so it can be argued that the real terrorist in xinjiang is infact the chinese communist party
907727 my doctor told me i was a happy meal away from diabetes
907728 jamen alle vil gerne sidde i lysthuset og bestiller altid dette rum
907729 when you see them up at two in the morning talking or crying or sharing gossip were right there with them
907730 id say i became like a big sister to some of them
907731 when they were having a problem i was certainly willing to provide advice i hope it was good advice
907732 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
907733 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
907734 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
907735 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
907736 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
907737 whatever the reason for the movement of the pregnant mother one must have grave concerns that the child will not be born into a better life but taken from the mother and forced into a life of exploitation which may also be quite short mr pascoe said
907738 this is an issue which goes to our own humanity he said
907739 our sympathy goes out to the family following this tragic death
907740 with school holidays in full swing we want to warn families to be aware of the dangers of tunnelling in sand
907741 wet sand as we have had today after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
907742 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
907743 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
907744 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
907745 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement
907746 we think this is coming from the bush appointed ideologues that are in there who are not apologetic about the departments stance on being anti woman anti birth control and anti abortion
907747 you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
907748 and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement
907749 absolute claims which could be at risk of breaching the trade practices act if the fairtrade certification process was not 100 per cent reliable
907750 fairtrade aims to give farmers and producers a much fairer deal and we strongly believe in that she said
907751 fairtrade does not serve the interests of the poor director of the institutes free trade unit tim wilson said
907752 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time she said
907753 miracle ii products soothe the mind body and the spirit the contents are all natural and the results are inspirational
907754 the resources stocks were the ones that were punished today its commodities prices its the oil price its rio tinto with that uncertainty about their guinea resource
907755 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now commonwealth securities economist savanth sebastian said
907756 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
907757 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight he said
907758 why do you want to learn how to do that
907759 a tunnel full of aliens who are secretly running the country
907760 the program basically gives an opportunity to those seeking an organized way to self deport
907761 provide the illegal aliens here with a right not to stay
907762 today is the worst day of my life i cant imagine that the person who destroyed a whole family got only two months she should be named and shamed
907763 i would have had your client acquitted two days ago
907764 okay so you bent me over seven times and rammed sharp stick up my ass we can still be friends
907765 so why is it that my neighborhood is the only one in my planned community where people are not allowed to hang our clothes out
907766 why are these organizations allowed to have so much power
907767 when we use the microwave or plug in a coffee maker our electricity system will function just like it does today but behind the scenes it will look and function quite differently and sic much cleaner
907768 we have to abandon the conceit that isolated personal actions are going to solve this crisis our policies have to shift
907769 this will buy us time to aggressively market the district and show potential developers that we are not only open for business but have some substantive incentives to make it worth their while to develop in south l a
907770 however a pure atkins style diet tends to cause high cholesterol and triglycerides
907771 they had no cancer and didnt suffer from other diseases while they ate only very fatty meat and almost no vegetables
907772 youre wrong and based on your own supposition not on data
907773 as far as banning the fast food place well fist she didnt ban them she put a moratorium on new ones im not sure what she thinks this will help
907774 taubes argues persuasively that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates white flour sugar easily digested starches and sugars
907775 it will help the existing fast food restaurants who are now guaranteed to operate competition free
907776 and i find my head is clearer when i dont
907777 the big problems the food we should be eating lean meats fruit and veggies whole grain breads all the healthy stuff around the edges of the supermarket is becoming prohibitively
907778 where to find the highest concentration of hot moms and alterna chicks
907779 thats what i get for calling all you people snakes the other day
907780 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission mr barltett said
907781 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
907782 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
907783 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
907784 let me be clear in no way do i think that john mccain s campaign is being racist i think they re being cynical i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
907785 i m young new to the national scene my name is barack obama i m african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia i do not have the typical biography of a presidential candidate
907786 people are still trying to get a fix on who i am where i come from
907787 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i don t like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then that s something i m open to
907788 we hope to create friendly robots that can exist side by side with people
907789 winglet will help everyone move around safely and stay active
907790 the punjab government is providing all kind of assistance to the relatives of victims for transportation of bodies from bhai jaitta civil hospital here
907791 he steve noticed the slightest traces of mortar adhering to pieces of flint in a field near st peters pit and michael and i followed up this sighting with a radar survey of the field
907792 the results were spectacular not only did they locate the building but the radar showed that it survived in very good condition and was quite large not a simple cell or room but something that resembled a small church
907793 it was probably built in the early 12th century and underwent a number of changes in ground plan
907794 one particularly exciting find is a large section of the south wall of the church which collapsed inwards probably when the building was being dismantled for building materials in the 16th century
907795 we have also found small pilgrim badges which indicates that the place was visited by pilgrims on their way to walsingham
907796 we aim to return to normal services as soon as possible
907797 i m guessing the investments will be in the region of us100 million dollars 107 million australian dollars and we will launch within 12 months
907798 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperatures and other weather conditions from these records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
907799 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
907800 global warming is a reality but our data show climate science is complex it is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening
907801 we have talked a lot about this we dont want other people to put themselves in danger to try to find him rolf is gone no matter what we do
907802 he hasn t got many other tricks left in his locker he will need to have a cabinet reshuffle and he will need to make a success of the economic relaunch he has got planned otherwise the cabinet will be under heavy pressure to act the crunch time will be late this month
907803 there has been a lamentable confusion of tactics and strategy
907804 problem is the material that we ve provided to mr judge clarke a good proportion of it belongs to the united kingdom authorities and we don t have consent to release that i don t have consent to release that the organisation doesn t have consent to release it nor does mr clarke
907805 it s nothing to do with the afp refusing to co operate with the inquiry
907806 the afp would be far better off if we could publicly put our submission out into both the community and the media but we can t and it s not within our control to do that or make that decision
907807 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesn t want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
907808 in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution

907972 i would also like to address other reasons why we believe world of warcraft will continue to grow despite increased competition
907973 there are significant barriers to entry for this genre it costs hundreds of millions of dollars to not only develop a game as robust as world of warcraft but also to create the infrastructure needed in order to support the operation of the game
907974 we have a team of over 100 developers who are continually expanding the game any massively multiplayer online game that launches today is not just competing with the content that we launched with back in 2004 they are also competing with a product and a service that has been continuously enhanced expanded and refined for almost four years now as well as our years of experience in running the game
907975 age of conan released with some initial success a couple of months ago and we did see some of our players leave to try the game however we have already seen about 40 per cent of those players return to world of warcraft and we expect even more to come back when wrath of the lich king launches later this year

908080 if this is the only toll free alternative the toll evaders from the pattullo and the port mann are going to find their way to our community over the alex fraser bridge
908081 our streets are congested as it is our community was never built for that kind of traffic north delta is becoming the doormat for everybody going home from work over the alex fraser to surrey and points beyond
908082 people in delta people who live around the alex fraser wont appreciate that
908083 when the liberal government proposed the twinning of the port mann bridge
908084 there was a promise implicit in that there would be no tolling of the pattullo bridge so that there was a toll free option offered to commuters
908085 its very disappointing to see now that translink finds itself with inadequate funding to replace this bridge and having to look at tolling it it really narrows the number of options for commuters
908086 a modest toll does not act as a big dissuasion for people to make a travel decision at least thats what all the traffic studies tell us
908087 when you do the traffic modelling what you find and the port mann is the best example is that today when people are spending 4 hours sitting on a bridge wasting time if they have the option of paying a few dollars to get across it a lot faster people will do that
908088 it would cost as much to rehabilitate the pattullo to provide three lanes for 50 years as it would to add three lanes on a new bridge that will last 100 years

908102 there is still a huge amount that will come down whether it happens next year or in 10 years it is hard to say

908106 the dark night is a certain inflowing of god into the soul which cleanses it of its ignorances and imperfections habitual natural and spiritual
908107 during the existential crisis one feels cut off from the deeper self higher power or god whatever one depends on beyond personal resources to provide strength and inspiration
908108 this sense of extreme isolation is reflected in the desolate prayer of jesus on the cross
908109 but in other cases not infrequent the personality is unable to rightly assimilate the inflow of light and energy
908110 but in the case of those who have had an inner awakening or a measure of spiritual realization the disturbances should not be considered as a mere pathological condition they have different far deeper causes as has been indicated by both plato and st john of the cross with similar analogies

908123 non ci sono dubbi sul fatto che il bayern monaco sia uno dei migliori club al mondo ricordo che quando ero bambino mio padre mi port allo stadio da luz di lisbona a vedere benfica bayern non dimenticher mai di aver visto dei giocatori incredibili in campo franz beckenbauer gerd muller sepp maier e paul breitner era veramente un gruppo super
908124 il bayern monaco ha gi disputato la supercoppa di germania ed pronto per iniziare la bundesliga loro sono gi pronti noi non ancora ci alleniamo da pochi giorni e per questo mi aspetto una gara difficile ma come ho detto prima non voglio essere campione nelle gare amichevoli voglio che sia pi difficile ora in modo che possa essere pi facile dopo

908138 andy exactly what is mesn doing for the severely affected greg
908139 hi greg i dont know why how you received a copy of andys e mail to the mes n committee about the 23 may ncodp meeting but since you did a couple of points need to be cleared up i have no comment to make on the references ascribed to me regarding either kevin short or eame
908140 in response to andys e mail you wrote exactly what is mesn doing for the severely affected
908141 this question cannot be answered directly since the severely affected is an abstract concept if one were to ask however what is mesn doing for severely affected m e sufferers the answer would be whatever within our power our severely affected members ask us to do for them
908142 what we do generally other than in response to specific requests from individuals is documented in our literature and monthly newsletter
908143 dear john as you know i meant severe me sufferers i just want to know exactly what issues mesn on your own initiative and under your own name as you stated are pursuing on behalf of severe me sufferers in norfolk i do not have access to your newsletters and information and meanwhile my wife is in utter torment best wishes greg
908144 as for the general picture we follow our constitutions aims and objectives which are to provide information and support to people with m
908145 i cant go into many specifics here because i cant remember them all and i would need to go through all our committee minutes correspondence and back issues of memo our newsletter to compile a comprehensive list
908146 off the top of my head i can refer to the talks by dr carruthers and prof hooper we sponsored in 2005 along with the dvds produced from those talks and distributed to health centres and surgeries throughout norfolk the various speakers eg betty dowsett jane colby nigel speight we have had following our agms over the years leafleting campaigns we have conducted usually in m
908147 i dont know that weve done anything specifically for the severely affected as such any more than weve done anything specifically for the mildly or moderately affected
908148 i was helpless bedridden and almost praying for death in the first few months of becoming ill
908149 if one were to ask however what is mesn doing for severely affected m
908150 there is a place beyond anger while my wife sits hunched in pain while there is nothing i can even make her to eat while she sits tormented by noise by movement in silence andrew dillon chief executive of nice through my mp norman lamb writes to me he says
908151 our guidance does not recommend cbt get for those with severe me cfs instead it recommends activity management administered by phone email or in person to be reviewed regularly and often
908152 activity management as recommended by nice is based upon the three principles of prioritising planning and pacing
908153 no matter do you know what my wifes response would be why not read it on
908154 you probably cannot imagine what it is like to be trapped in a cycle of never ending opposite
908155 where rest leads to increased dysfunction where sleep leads to a complete ceasing of your bodys ability to move and an agony of increased pain where touch noise communication even tenderness are experienced as an assault on your physical and mental processes
908156 if you want to engage with people with severe me then try imagining a world that responds completely the opposite way to your intention where exercise leads to inability and increasing disability get your sleep under control control the pain pace your energy just relax your muscles these things are nonsense
908157 nices recommendation that people with severe cfs me should be offered an individually tailored activity management programme as the core therapeutic strategy which may draw on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy 1
908158 1 when the psychiatric lobby are reported declaring that me no longer exists
908159 2 when i hear that action for me are calling for more and better trained therapists
908160 3 when i wrote to my local group me support norfolk and asked them to tell me exactly what they are doing for the severely affected and they responded
908161 i am an artist yesterday i painted my rage my eyes are tight shut my brow knotted up as if in agony my mouth wide open in a teeth bared scream
908162 there is a place beyond anger where i sit for hours and hours every day just holding my wife when i can trying to ease her physical torment
908163 what hope is there of getting proper medical tests and treatment or validation for this severely disabling multi dysfunctional neurological disease when these are the attitudes and views of the people who represent me to the world
908164 when severe me sufferers are alone and off the radar
908165 i am sorry for asking my local group what they are doing for the severely affected
908166 for where i sit faced with yet another day of my wifes pain and suffering i am not sure i have much patience anymore for that i am sorry from where i reach out these hands that long to heal i am not sure i know how to cope not that i ever did
908167 i live in the moment its best not to stand back too much for then surely after 15 solid years of never ending agony shaking every inch of my wifes ravished body i would go mad with despair
908168 if i thought about it too much but i have my faith and my anger that is why i dared to ask
908169 im sorry too for assuming that your remarks both here and in your beyond anger posting were aimed at m e support norfolk i tend to forget that we have west norfolk m e support and brame also here in this county
908170 you refer to your local support group since you are not a member of mes n despite a number of invitations to join i guess your reference is to one of the other two groups
908171 however if you really are talking about mes n can you please explain what you mean by being angry they are not involved politically
908172 especially since you are not in any way involved in what we do where on earth do you get that idea
908173 recently i wrote a couple of days ago really to my local m
908174 anyway i wrote back and said look im talking about people with severe m
908175 and i would just like to ask in this video if anybodys watching what is it like where you live what is your local organisation doing for the severely affected perhaps you could write to your organisation or if youre part of an organisation you could write to me and tell me what are you doing for people with severe m e it would be really really good to find that out really interesting and i wonder if what is happening here locally is happening up and down the country and no wonder were getting nowhere thank you
908176 too many people diagnosed with me cfs have no idea what the illness is they have no burning pains exacerbated by illness they are the ones who recover and are welll enough to run these local groups they never had me thats why exercise diet and relaxation worked for them thats why serious is an abstrat mythical term for them
908177 hi i was totally dismayed and completely disgusted by the response that greg and linda got when they contacted their local me group to find out what support they might offer for someone who is suffering from severe me
908178 on 4 july a mission statement from m e support norfolk was published on wordpress blog me agenda on 18 june the site published a note of thanks to the committee of m e support norfolk for devoting eight pages of two of its spring newsletters to raising awareness of the concerns surrounding the rsm cfs conference and for promoting two separate initiatives which had been organised in protest against this conference a response has been published by the chair to unwarranted criticism
908179 what is happening here locally is happening up and down the country
908180 as for the general picture we follow our constitutions aims and objectives which are to provide information and support to people with m
908181 i cant go into many specifics here because i cant remember them all and i would need to go through all our committee minutes correspondence and back issues of memo our newsletter to compile a comprehensive list

908217 there are many transit vehicles and cars trying to make the right turn to fourth and have to wait for the crosswalk to clear
908218 on a number of occasions ive boarded a brand new bus for this route
908219 the new buses are great but why dont the windows on the new metro buses open
908220 what we have learned with other air conditioned buses is that if people have the discretion to open windows the incoming air hot or cold confuses the temperature controls and defeats what we are trying to accomplish with either heating or cooling the bus
908221 the buses consequently end up being filled to capacity quickly with passengers standing
908222 how can metro convince drivers to give up their car commutes when they end up having to stand on crowded buses
908223 but it hardly seems fair that with ridership being up metro takes away the right capacity sized buses to pack riders in so uncomfortably
908224 what it was is it was a sock inside the shoe that appeared to contain decomposed flesh
908225 we dont know at this point whether thats animal whether its human or what it is

908227 our costs are usually about 50 percent more than conventional equipment
908228 that 50 percent youll generally see back in about five years
908229 another thing that puts a damper on it is we enjoy relatively low cost electricity
908230 its also partly a function of how they potential buyers just havent seen much of it
908231 geothermal power is a clean renewable resource with considerable potential in western washington

908247 my reaction has been one of dismay and bitter disappointment for the local communities
908248 there are villages half a mile from this site and there has been a lack of consultation
908249 waste classed as very low level radioactive includes construction waste created as facilities such as office buildings are demolished as part of the decommissioning process at the sellafield site
908250 this waste is appropriate for landfilling at facilities such as keekle head
908251 mining on the site has created a substantial void which is ideal for the disposal of waste materials
908252 our scheme would include early high quality restoration of parts of the site and after the landfilling is complete final restoration as heathland
908253 this is a first in the world this is a fully automatic spacecraft that docked with the space station totally under its own control and thats never been done before by anybody at all so from a purely technical point of view its really quite incredible

908255 im willing to bet the dollar will weaken against other currencies over the longer term so i feel no need to hedge those currencies
908256 we are happy to invest in businesses that earn their money in the euro or in companies that derive their earnings in germany or from the sterling in the uk because i dont have a feeling that those currencies are going to depreciate in a big way against the dollar

908314 wacht even voor u hem aansteekt dan steek ik er eerst zelf een op dan kunt u beter ruiken hoe de geur is
908315 those guys are talented and theyve worked pretty hard this year
908316 i honestly think bolt can run 9 6 i think asafa can run 9 6 and a healthy tyson can run 9 6
908317 probably 19 7 or lower for first place and well see after that im definitely going to run 19 its just a matter of 19 what
908318 i definitely cant consider someone who has run a 9 74 a sleeper
908319 theyve kind of said through one of their front office guys that if favre did report they would potentially trade him within the division
908320 the bears just kind of are what they are i dont see him in detroit either at least the vikings offense is what hes used to old dogs dont learn new tricks especially in three weeks
908321 hes already carried this thing out too far its kind of a joke
908322 hes hit everything pitches at every location whether its because hes from here and he gets fired up to play us i dont know but hes been very very good against us
908323 i guess i get a little fired up to play these guys
908324 its my hometown team you know everybody back home is watching
908325 it makes me feel like im 15 again with my family coming to see the games
908326 maybe hes more relaxed against these guys because he grew up here
908327 i think hes going to be very serviceable for us
908328 he pitched just like our scouts said he could almost to a t
908329 he commanded everything changed speeds well and made very few mistakes location wise he was just the guy we hoped to see
908330 there was something wrong with the horse in the belmont but i could see in the mornings since that he was the same horse
908331 i planned to go to the lead but it would have been suicidal
908332 i felt pretty cozy until the leader took off on the final turn i said to myself this wont be easy big brown had to go and get him
908333 i didnt know he had this kind of courage hes a warrior i love this horse hes so intelligent if he was a human being id want to go clubbing with him
908334 since ive been born its been a roller coaster for me
908335 i usually dont look for anything i usually try and react
908336 he threw a couple fastballs a couple change ups he left the fastball over the plate and i got the barrel to it
908337 thats where youve got to step off and say hey the only thing that matters is this next pitch and im one pitch away from getting out of it one pitch away from giving it up too but you dont want to think about those types of things
908338 we got him off his feet and that made him stronger
908339 this was a great way to end a road trip going into a big series against florida
908340 he went right at him about 450 feet worth but he did well he pitched pretty good
908341 but why didnt you hiss in order to protect yourself
908342 i sat at the table across from you and your friend i was there with my uncles

908353 it doesnt matter how much i bring to the table when youve got brian westbrook lorenzo booker and correll buckhalter back there
908354 i was expecting it would be a real good battle between the top two and jed has put himself right in the middle of the competition
908355 pretty quickly we should get able to get a better evaluation on him once hes a little more comfortable his natural ability will show up
908356 he is kind of a dark horse but he has caught the coaches eyes
908357 hes looking to make the team any way he can
908358 i was mentally prepared to go five or six innings
908359 with so many young guys they need to hear it from a player

908363 i want a fourth of my investments to go to xyz company that is looking for vc funding
908364 in very preliminary stages and that no firm decisions had been taken
908365 i said you know what it looks legit because its not some gimmick
908366 it involves actually working hard and changing the regimen all the time
908367 id be real happy if i was able to keep this type of power and consistency through the season
908368 i liked it because it really worked a lot with the explosion of the legs
908369 jumping cardio aerobic push ups pull ups jumping back and forth its crazy yoga stretch tempo its all kind of mixed into one
908370 and he was standing on a chair doing it at first
908371 hes hit them in warm ups hes hit them during our team reps
908372 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
908373 the argument got a little heated when it really started raining i had to walk away but i feel we have a great relationship because we can be brutally honest with each other
908374 it was a little stressful at times but it worked out for us
908375 we argue on a regular basis walk away and calmer heads prevail were here to win
908376 bob is the crew chief the captain of the ship and he made a courageous call
908377 im glad im doing it now as opposed to a couple days from now when we go to pittsburgh
908378 its not bad at all today was a good test to see where im at and i feel good
908379 if you have five rookies on your offense youre going to have some offensive mistakes there and its going to cost you at some point or another
908380 same thing that we ran into with special teams last year we had some great athletes on the field but one guy would make a mistake and it would look like the whole scheme was busted
908381 its a lot easier for the guys that have been out there that have been in the battles to understand the little concepts of the game even a center trying to pick out and rub a guy off
908382 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted
908383 they just see it as trendy because people talk about it
908384 unfortunately they glamorise it but theres nothing glamorous about losing your teeth and your hair and the sores
908385 we believe these trans panic and gay panic defenses need to be rejected and that local law enforcement needs to begin aggressive prosecution of all such cases as hate crimes
908386 if the judge had set a more appropriate bond or if the shelby county district attorney had been more aggressive at scheduling a trial date this man might not have been out walking the streets for two and half years and that child might still be alive
908387 i am the christ heart of god i am the will of love in action and the will of love is

908393 however a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
908394 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart

908403 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
908404 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
908405 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
908406 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement

908416 but he told me hed just have to take both cats then
908417 yeah i told him he was being ridiculous so just let me work on him for a few more days
908418 maybe you can tell him youll only give her up if he agrees to have her live at his mothers house then he wont be the one responsible for her
908419 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
908420 he really hit with a lot of uppercuts but i never felt anything

908522 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
908523 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
908524 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
908525 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement
908526 we unfortunately have a culture among many young people to drink to get drunk and many people believe the more you drink the more popular you will be
908527 but there is no way that someone as young as 15 should be consuming alcohol in these amounts and we need to get that message across
908528 in this case what police are investigating is that he has died unusually or unexpectedly after attending a party all detectives can say is hed been at a party and had been drinking
908529 in discussions with both governments i will cover matters of mutual interest including the response to the breakdown in the world trade organisation doha round of negotiations global financial uncertainty regional architecture and climate change
908530 our bilateral relations are strong and we enjoy one of the most complementary trade relationships in the world
908531 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
908532 people started pushing their way back and many women and children fell down whoever fell down was trampled upon by the surge of devotees
908533 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
908534 should environmental departments foresee serious air pollution during the olympics beijing and neighbouring areas will temporarily close more factories and pull more cars off the road
908535 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it
908536 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision
908537 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
908538 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk
908539 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era
908540 im just amazed that they didnt take any fingerprints in the cabin and they didnt do any testing at all
908541 its not as you see it on tv you spray a bit of this and theres your criminal
908542 there is nothing whatsoever to indicate they staged their disappearance
908543 that is going too far its just going too far
908544 the definition of choking is when you are in a winning position and you dont win so for a couple of weeks we have given people ammunition to make those comments
908545 on saturday night we played well but we lost the game because we didnt take the chances when we got them and pure accuracy conversion wins and loses you games
908546 the last two weeks we have kicked inaccurately and conversion accuracy is one of footballs great skills
908547 getting the ball in the first place is difficult but converting is the cream on the cake and winning and losing comes from that
908548 jeffs a leader to all the aboriginal boys at the club and also to a lot of younger guys
908549 i would like to see him stick around for a couple more years because i reckon wiz farmer is a great leader on the field and a lot of boys look up to him
908550 if ive got anything to talk about hes always there to back me up hes sort of like another brother to me
908551 i havent spoken to wiz about his future i think hes spoken to his manager but the way ive seen it i think hell be playing on next year
908552 weve got a few older players who are retiring this year and i guess its time for the young players to step up
908553 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
908554 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
908555 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
908556 we are going to be in this for the long haul
908557 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
908558 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
908559 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
908560 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response
908561 previously the licence structure hasnt tried to incorporate any degree of social harm or risk into it
908562 we think its time that it did incorporate those factors
908563 as long as its an objective analysis and is based on a reasonable assessment of risk we would be quite happy to be discussing the implications of that from a fee point of view with the government
908564 weve always said its one key part of the jigsaw to be looked at to improve and reduce anti social behaviour and violence in the cbd
908565 its contributing to reducing public order issues in the city but at this stage i think weve really got to wait for the full evaluation to be conducted

908577 la funci n que han desarrollado los voluntarios nunca se podr llegar a agradecer lo suficiente es como una paradoja quien tiene los medios que son las instituciones est n en la mayor a de loscasos totalmente al margen y sin embargo ves como gente an nima en su tiempo libre con sus propios medios dedica tanto esfuerzo a ayudarnos
908578 los que est claro es que la asociaci n est realizando una labor social muy importante
908579 en cuanto conoc la tarea no me lo pens dos veces
908580 hab a estado leyendo bastante sobre la guerra civil espa ola y cuando supe la tarea que estaba haciendo la asociaci n no me lo pens dos veces
908581 las grandes diferencias es que en esos lugares fue una intervenci n inmediata y aqu trabajamos m s de 20 a os despu s adem s all ten amos el apoyo de naciones unidas y sin embargo aqu dependemos de la buena fe de los voluntarios tenemos mucha menos infraestructura y a penas hay ayuda a nivel de las instituciones
908582 es realmente admirable ver como esta gente se entrega de lleno
908583 los recupero de forma simb lica cada vez que recuperamos los restos de alg n represaliado
908584 es muy emocionante muchas veces te tienes que separar de all porque el momento es de ellos y es un momento triste pero a la vez es alegre es recuperar a un ser querido devolverle la dignidad

908589 pas una infancia sin mi abuelo y mi familia se distanci y vivi separada por culpa de la guerra por eso cada caso cada historia y cada cuerpo que desenterramos lo siento como si fuera la historia de mi familia por eso he decidido implicarme tanto

908591 it should be based on the good judgment of the commanders if an attack is imminent against our people and our units then we can initiate actions the whole point is we will not wait for them to shoot at us if its imminent as i said we will not allow ourselves to be sitting ducks
908592 combat action we will take preventive actions or use appropriate force if necessary

908619 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now commonwealth securities economist savanth sebastian said
908620 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
908621 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight he said

908624 we do not agree with the amendments and as we have suspected the suggested amendments do not solve the difficulties faced by students in political activities
908625 the language used does not give students any concrete freedom we can see that the decisive power still very much lies in the hands of the university administration and the minister
908626 may become members of any society and organisation in or outside malaysia
908627 political parties any unlawful organisation and any organisation which the minister has specified in writing to vice chancellors as unsuitable to the interests and well being of the students or the university
908628 although some of the amendments open the door for greater student freedom the limitations set are against human rights
908629 we have not acted rashly we have the capability to think intellectually and thus we are submitting this suggestion paper at least we have not organised demonstrations
908630 the amendments still have a lot of restrictions with an ambiguous section 15

908687 tired of the usual chicken dinners the manchester republican committee is planning to arm supporters next month with uzis m 16 rifles and other automatic weapons for a day of target practice at a pelham firing range
908688 the citizens of manchester have lived through a deadly spike in violent crime the past year and a half despite the campaign promises of mayor frank guinta to lower crime rates
908689 that the mayors political party would seek to glorify the use of machine guns for political gain is unconscionable
908690 that same cold mix of political calculation and ideological certainty is evident when conservatives balk at gun controls reversing liberal policies and playing to a core constituency are more compelling than the now serialized stories of shootings and senseless death instead the discussion turns on the freedom of the individual to own something private citizens dont need and society cant reasonably afford as is surprisingly often the case with a government led by an unusually cerebral prime minister its an emotional argument about symbols that tilt to partisan advantage and away from sound public policy
908691 in the war of symbols guns reign supreme in america meaning owning a gun says more about your politics than how you use it the symbolic meaning of owning a gun is to reclaim political power demonize minorities distort the issue of crime in america express contempt for women gaining access to power and distract americans from the real issues of democracy

908712 i think we know that whatever were experiencing now is part of a long passage each new dynasty replaced the buildings that had been constructed by the last one
908713 architects are trained to be perfect men in the pursuit of absolute truth theyre taught that their ideas should be made concrete in the form of a building that lasts forever but thats selfish
908714 architecture schools have become too vocational and focus too much on professional and skill based training and not enough on leadership the education should be a lot more philosophical

908764 his offensive scheme is a big issue playing in the shotgun 1 2 3 and out its totally different getting under center he is going to have to adjust to the pro style attack he won a lot of games and you have to respect that but he didnt have to read defenses thats a problem
908765 arm strength is a big time question mark his release point needs to be fixed
908766 i think brennans production is a function of his system like a lot of texas tech qbs for example and his body isnt built to last in the nfl
908767 hes got a smallish frame he needs more size and physical strength as a passer he has a quick release but his accuracy is inconsistent this is a major issue because of his technical flaws low release point footwork he tends to spray the football too much his ball sails and dives at times he needs to refine his mechanics his overall arm strength is average brennan can make the intermediate throws but id question whether he really has the drive to put the football between defenders at the nfl level
908768 the senior bowl exposed him as having a marginal nfl type arm especially in inclement weather wind rain etc his pass happy system that worked in college wont translate to the nfl teams cant spread the field and go five wide consistently against better athletes youll see that things happen a lot quicker this was witnessed in the bowl game hawaii had against georgia where brennan really struggled in spurts in the end brennan lacks the size arm and accuracy to project as a starter in the nfl i see him as a second day fourth fifth round pick who can develop in time into a solid backup anything more than that in this opinion is doubtful
908769 has the skill and ability to play at the next level needs to improve and work on mechanics such as his delivery and foot work we like his production arm strength accurate deep ball

908797 it wont be on just hearsay well watch a lot of tape on the players that have played over the year and try and weed through which ones will stay and go
908798 there arent too many players that have put a huge cross against their name in the last few weeks
908799 they are either maintaining their standing or treading water if you like or they are just bobbing up a little bit higher we still look forward to them proving themselves one way or another
908800 we still look forward to them proving it one way or the other
908801 right at the start of the year i knew how many were out of contract and how many were borderline it could be between three that you have to and 10 you can pick and choose from which is a quarter of the list if you like
908802 i can guarantee that players individually ring me up so thats a nice thing talking about their futures and what they see in the future of port adelaide
908803 our recruiting people are not only being certain on the lower draft picks but they are also concerned and concentrating on who might come through as an uncontracted player as well
908804 weve got lots of flexibility with the cap and we look forward to the best player available coming here and making an impact straight away
908805 we are certainly not going to restrict who we play and who we dont play but we want to make sure we just dont load up with a whole lot of young blokes that cant be very very competitive like they were yesterday

908867 weve seen job ads fall for three consecutive months which points to further softness in the labour market in coming months

908878 i have spoken with a member of paula wriedts family this afternoon and i need to inform the public of recent events
908879 paula was taken to the royal hobart hospital by ambulance a short while ago as the result of an undisclosed medical emergency
908880 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission
908881 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation
908882 it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
908883 she needs to focus on getting well with the support of her family and friends
908884 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
908885 in the interim i will be undertaking her portfolio roles
908886 i have offered paulas family my personal support and that of the government
908887 i will respect their right to make a decision on further comments regarding her condition
908888 i would appeal to the media to show appropriate restraint
908889 my thoughts and those of all government mps are very much with paula love and betrayal
908890 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
908891 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
908892 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
908893 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
908894 we warned folk to only deal with authorised ticket suppliers
908895 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
908896 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
908897 there may be tickets on ebay that are delivered but i think it is a great risk that would be my message

908907 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
908908 one dutch was rescued by helicopter from k2 this morning while an italian is still at an altitude of 7 200 metres
908909 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
908910 the three mountaineers who survived are suffering from severe frostbite
908911 they are badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
908912 the rope collapsed and the climbers started falling in various directions some fell in neighbouring china some in pakistan
908913 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain climber fredrik straeng told the swedish news agency tt explaining how he feared for his life when a pakistani fell on top of him
908914 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
908915 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people
908916 im just amazed that they didnt take any fingerprints in the cabin and they didnt do any testing at all
908917 its not as you see it on tv you spray a bit of this and theres your criminal

908940 americans are only voting for the chance to vote for a black president
908941 once they get to the general election i think theyll find a 73 year old white republican is just about the kind of change theyre ready for
908942 i think about that line a lot actually its a little scary
908943 and its about race and politics am i black enough how black do you need to be
908944 its called primarily colored and it deals with the politics of authenticity
908945 not as funny as kennedy hes a little stiffer to me
908946 politicians i dont trust their sense of humor these days i always feel somebody gave them a joke you know im not saying that didnt happen back then but kennedy certainly was quick
908947 ive seen obama be quick in certain situations ive seen mccain the same way too hillary clinton i think has an underappreciated sense of humor ive seen her be very funny in off the cuff situations
908948 i think im coming in to being able to get away with how ive been for a long time
908949 when i did stand up when i was in my 20s and i had this approach it always worked in stand up but it didnt translate well to television
908950 so now im very happy that im old enough to have my sense of humor come across
908951 were living in extraordinary times right now too you know and to have a candidate like mr obama and the fact that the daily show is going to be at the conventions you know its just huge i just feel so fortunate to be able to do it
908952 when hally does things wrong we generally normally cop it sweet
908953 at the moment theres a barry hall fixation by the people in the media which is becoming a little bit unpleasant
908954 its getting a little bit tedious a little bit boring a little bit offensive in some ways
908955 everything that hallys involved in tends to come under scrutiny
908956 the media really focus on certain players and certain incidents and dont focus on other players
908957 there are a lot of players getting away with a lot worse things than what barry hall did on the weekend
908958 incidents like you saw with hally on the weekend probably happen 10 times a game
908959 it was a head high tackle incidental contact and gilbee obviously felt a knock to the head
908960 it was a reasonably simple incident it was an innocuous thing
908961 when you look at it you laugh its laughable its becoming a little bit farcical
908962 we just expect hally to be treated like every other player
908963 youve got to win games of footy you dont want to finish fourth out of some sort of miracle of the draw or other teams not being able to win

908980 im concerned but im not smart enough to know whether its a long term injury or not
908981 id be concerned because he wasnt able to play today
908982 i was basically icing it all day its just uncomfortable my right ankle felt like this the other day so hopefully i can bounce back as quick as i did the other time its part of the game it stinks
908983 thats what makes the big inning right there i was feeling good the whole game i dont know what happened in the seventh
908984 a punch out would have been great but youre looking for a ground ball in that situation with the infield in if he hits it right at somebody were probably still playing

908992 they are heavily equipped but small very flexible very fast very light we are not paying for tons of steel we are paying for firepower later theyre fast patrol boats but quite well equipped even later i am satisfied now we just need good exercises to train and practice of course theres always something that could be better but in something this size we cant have 10 surface to surface missiles and 20 surface to air missiles there will always be limitations we are quite happy with what we have right now

908994 the navy now fears those testing grounds could be irreparably compromised with a regulation approved this week by california air regulators state officials have ordered cargo ships to use cleaner burning but more expensive fuel within 24 nautical miles of the coast something the military fears could entice them to cut through its training ground at issue is the sea lane used by cargo ships entering and exiting the ports of los angeles and long beach the lane now runs along the coast from los angeles to northwest of santa barbara a 183 mile voyage that takes ships between the coast and the eastern boundary of the navys testing range with the new air regulation shipping companies looking to save money by burning less of the cleaner fuel could take a more direct path between the ports and international waters that would put them on course for the navys training ground

909043 the police action was prompted by the australians revelations this month about the charitys connection to interpal a humanitarian network proscribed by australia and the us
909044 executive director mohammed taha alsalami said last night he was shocked that his organisation had failed to pull from its website a fundraising appeal that links its charity work to interpal its a shock that its still there it shouldnt have been there in the first place this whole matter is very sensitive now we have to abide by the law and theres no question about that if there was any wrongdoing it should appear

909057 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
909058 the visual part of things took off by itself because immediately after i completed my studies i joined art athina a contemporary art fair and things took their own course
909059 but i prefer cinema as a language because i have a lot more time as well as imagery to narrate things in a more complex fashion
909060 i was interested in working on a simple and sparse story however i think that it also includes other dimensions and levels that open other doors it addresses anger oppression lack of communication loneliness
909061 the films title could well have been ping pong because all these things have to do with the protagonists the films objective is for it to rest on still lifes as in visual art at points where the details count
909062 it was very difficult to make progress with such a script but ultimately things worked very well from the onset the cast realized that it was faced with a challenge in a style of filmmaking that transcends both commercial and pseudo artistic ways
909063 another crucial thing is that actors need to be creative rather than just executers of roles the difficulty here was that a certain acting form needed to be followed because everything in the film is kind of symbolic not exactly as it seems
909064 he can play with very fine nuances and project them to the viewers the character he plays goes through a transition which the audience needs to search for to realize
909065 as for constantine giannaris who plays the role of a manager in three or four scenes he is the most appropriate person for the role his contribution gives me strength especially because he believes that i have a distinctive writing style
909066 the fire is continuing while being generally brought under control

909068 the need for a valuable public commodity like water cannot be used as a form of blackmail or method to exercise pressure on the state and local communities
909069 the areas ghetto like character has resulted in a massive decline in leasing rates so that chinese companies are now the only ones interested in leasing
909070 the sole line of defense in order to avoid the full ghettoization of those areas is the greek owned companies that are present there at the moment their removal will effectively open the gateway for the usurpation of the whole area
909071 this is why the studies for town planning and zoning interventions should not only aim at helping the area to improve but also offer incentives for companies active in this area to stay here

909074 the years of the 28th olympiad of the modern games
909075 we showed to ourselves first that we could achieve great aims if we displayed dedication concentration and persistence we proved also to the astonished international community that the stereotype of undisciplined and unreliable greeks was just a stereotype in other words shallow and silly
909076 we did not play well in this game and we were very nervous but it does not matter with this team i am never afraid of losing
909077 an average of 170 to 180 babies die in this hospital annually
909078 if 27 babies die in three days and 47 in a month they just cannot explain this as normal no matter how many risky cases they handle
909079 moreover if everything is normal why did they decide to stop admitting women for premature births
909080 two or three women are made to wait on the same stretcher before giving birth and sometimes three newborn babies are put in the same incubator
909081 we are ecstatic at this win which is the first for us we believe we have achieved something remarkable as this race is extremely competitive
909082 such incidents are an insult to the culture that our country taught and continues to teach and harm its image overseas
909083 and as we talk about greeces image abroad it is logical that these isolated incidents sadden us even more
909084 in athens we went straight to a nightclub kept by a one legged maltese who gave us cocktails made out of odd drugs and a spirit of his own distilling later the prima ballerina of the cabaret came out and sat at our table and warned us on no account to touch the cocktails it was too late
909085 why oh why do the wrong people travel when the right people stay at home
909086 rich people of all ages tend to take more though not necessarily longer vacations
909087 this season we have many russians a lot of bulgarians all of them with more money to spend than the germans or the brits in past years we had to teach our staff some russian

909152 im thrilled to have won this rally and im especially pleased with the way we won it
909153 from start to finish the scrap reminded me of the thrilling clashes we had last year with marcus gr nholm it was a very close run thing throughout and we were never able to relax
909154 it was really big tension and big stress all the time flat out everywhere at the start of the stages you knew that you couldnt make any mistakes it was really difficult
909155 it is difficult to remember all the wins ive had during my career in the wrc but this one for sure is one of the best of them i won in sweden in 2004 to become the only non scandinavian winner there but it was not the same kind of fight here there was a big fight and that gives you the most satisfaction

909160 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
909161 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
909162 thank you sioux city i said it wrong ive been in iowa for too long im sorry
909163 i believe that normalization of relations with cuba would help the oppressed and poverty stricken cuban people while setting the stage for a more democratic government once castro inevitably leaves the scene
909164 john mccain needs to explain why continuing to do exactly what george bush has done will somehow produce a different result
909165 with reasonable men i will reason with humane men i will plead but to tyrants i will give no quarter nor waste arguments where they will certainly be lost
909166 the fear factor really has to be removed from cuban political discourse and that one of the most dramatic ways to begin this process would be by freeing political prisoners and for the cuban regime to make clear that it has enough confidence in itself and enough confidence in the cuban people that it can begin a dialogue without using the secret police and the security services as a moderator of political discourse
909167 i will not vote for barack obama i will not stay home i will go to the polls and proudly write on my ballot hillary clinton i want the dnc to count my vote as a protest vote i want them to know i am tired of being a second class citizen in my own country this isnt about barack obama or john mccain this isnt about iraq or iran this is about a war a war for our voice our dignity and our selves i hope you will join me
909168 we are especially excited and proud to have mary katharine ham join the washington examiner because she among the most respected young stars of online journalism and is also well known to cable television and talk radio audiences through her regular appearances on the oreilly factor on fox news
909169 her hiring demonstrates again our commitment to building a great news and information company that excels in three channels including newspapers online and video
909170 in washington some people say the presidential primary in south dakota doesnt much matter that your voice doesnt really count
909171 but you know what tuesday we can show em we can pick a president after all just because south dakota comes last in the primaries doesnt mean we shouldnt be heard loud and clear and we can pick the candidate wholl stand up for us hillary clinton

909178 pulex irritans appears to have spread with humans around the world during the post glacial period there is evidence of its presence at viking settlements in dublin and york
909179 law enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
909180 the drug networks are highly fluid adapting effectively to law enforcement interventions
909181 the illegal status of drugs is likely to have contained their availability and use to some extent drug laws do not appear to have direct effects on the prevalence of drug use tougher enforcement measures have not necessarily deterred use
909182 in the past too much emphasis has been placed on lower level street deals what we are trying to deal with are the major importers
909183 there is some evidence that enforcement activity can affect drug prices
909184 there is evidence of the uk wholesale price being greater than that in continental markets
909185 we do not think that there is much of a loophole in practice partly because the scope of the complete defence of self defence is so wide and partly because of the way that the courts have over the years extended the application of the partial defence of provocation our analysis of cases from 2005 did not reveal any where a murder conviction appeared to have resulted inappropriately as a result of the absence of such a partial defence

909192 over the last few years a lot of people have said hip hop has sold out that its full of advertorials but i take a different point of view if 50 cent mentions gucci you know its a global metaphor for success
909193 how do you keep an edge a crispness a relevance
909194 offences of most serious violence against the person will tend to provide a more reliable measure of trends than overall violence recorded by the police as they are more immune to changes in reporting and recording
909195 bbc one i was struck by the extraordinary change in his accent when he talked to his parents
909196 not that a slightly off london accent isnt a regional accent because it is
909197 but it reads slightly more generically than a scottish accent does
909198 matthew hoggard was annoyed to hear that pattinson talked with an aussie twang i know hoggy has not been in the england dressing room for a while but has he forgotten how tim ambrose talks or kevin pietersen on the basis that it is where you are brought up that counts england have assimilated south africans allan lamb smith pietersen zimbabweans graeme hick australians ambrose the hollioake brothers geraint jones and any number of west indians gladstone small ellcock roland butcher over past decades that is not a roll call of shame but a list of which to be proud

909200 during dvorak 8 at the proms on friday i think there was applause between each movement and then again last night there was applause after at least one movement of tchaikovsky 6 this makes me cringe it destroys mood but it is happening much more often than it used to im sure is it ignorance or just a new trend
909201 just in the middle of the first allegro there was a passage i was sure would please all the listeners went into raptures over it applauded heartily but as when i wrote it i was quite aware of its effect i introduced it once more towards the end and it was applauded all over again
909202 mandatory regulation and labelling could be on the cards for the alcohol industry
909203 the drinks industry is not adhering to its own voluntary standards and new evidence suggesting that alcohol is a far wider cause of damage to peoples health than previously suspected
909204 in many places alcohol is being sold and marketed irresponsibly
909205 over the next few months we will work intensively with industry representatives and other interested groups to breathe new life into the system if necessary we will introduce legislation to make the new standards mandatory
909206 alcohol can play an important and positive role in british society
909207 we are not just limiting our description of inequality by gender or race but we are also looking at this extremely important issue of class
909208 focusing on the impact of social class on the lives of poorer families
909209 the growth of vertical inequality of income wealth and power is shaking public confidence in the fairness of the distribution of the rewards of economic success
909210 we will not only focus on the inequalities that emerge from the horizontal divisions of our society between men and women between disabled and non disabled people the disadvantages faced by lesbian gay and bisexual people or inequality based on age ethnicity or religion and belief
909211 we also intend to address the vertical gaps those between richest and poorest

909213 the uk rainfall total for june was appreciably above average but in contrast to may southern britain was relatively dry whilst very unsettled conditions afflicted northern areas from mid month especially terminating some notable dry spells

909226 this is a huge growth and acceptance from the tour players we have given them a few new tools this year and they have continued to trust us for aids that give them the feedback they need to maintain and improve their high level of performance
909227 ive been on the tours for 14 years ive seen several aids come and go the eyeline products continue to address what the pros are working on
909228 putting is the most critical part of a tour players game so trusting an aid is serious business
909229 the tours have taken our products around the globe the wgc bridgestone invitational this week has players from all over the world many of the players bring their teachers they will see eyeline products in use and will take them home it is quite amazing
909230 but it is more important that we are keeping our promise to the players who trust us to be there for them each week if we counted all the players from all the years nearly every tour player would be on our list that is not a stat we focus on we are much more concerned if we are giving them tools that help them improve if we do this then our customers will have access to the best equipment on the planet that gets me excited
909231 the tour is a great source of ideas and testing our customers like to hear stories of how a tour player is using the same aid they practice with tour players are working on the same fundamentals as the amateur occasionally a player will tell me they bought a product online or in a store because they needed it for practice during an off week that is always satisfying
909232 i am truly honored to be recognized by my fellow professionals for this award

909252 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
909253 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
909254 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
909255 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
909256 that device had a real potential to put that family in jeopardy
909257 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments
909258 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
909259 zimbabweans are looking at the current talks with cautious optimism they are very weary of the likely outcome from these negotiations as you are aware in 1987 there were negotiations between the zanu pf and zapu zimbabwe african peoples union and the negotiations came up with a unity agreement that basically failed to address the core issues basically the agreement led to the annihilation of the opposition in matabeleland
909260 zimbabweans are quite weary that for the mdc to go and negotiate with the zanu pf such a scenario like the previous talks might come out of those negotiations the second thing is that zimbabweans are quite cognizant that whatever negotiations take place their will or their decision in march 29 is non negotiable which means that the decision that they made that the mdc is the government they would want to be in place needs to be respected in any negotiation process
909261 the fact that the sadc southern african development community and the au african union are monitoring the peace process does not give zimbabweans confidence based on the fact that the two bodies have had their credibility eroded to a large extent the aus acceptance of robert mugabe to go to the au summit after the african union and pan african parliament and sadc had all declared that the election in june were not an expression of the free will of the people of zimbabwe was an indictment on the au it was a sign that the au body is complicit with mugabe in terms of subverting the will of the people of zimbabwe
909262 so there is some hesitance on the part of zimbabweans to say there is no guarantee that the au will protect their vote more importantly that it was exacerbated by the resolutions that came out advocating for a government of national unity
909263 there are two routes leading to the temple and the barricades put up to streamline human traffic broke down and in the melee everything went haywire

909284 hoe verhoudt het secularisme zich in de praktijk en als ideaal ten opzichte van de islam
909285 seculier betekent dat de overheid geen invloed mogen uitoefenen op de maatschappij

909287 het is noodzakelijk voor een moslim om een heerser te gehoorzamen zolang hij niet wordt opgedragen een zonde te begaan als hem op wordt opgedragen een zonde te begaan dan is er geen gehoor en gehoorzaamheid

909414 4th and dauphin 21st and cecil b moore 22nd and lehigh 27th and master 32nd and huntingdon 27th and clearfield 12th and york
909415 theres lots of gunfire in this neck of the woods
909416 we try to grab kids young and get them into baseball because otherwise theyre spending the summer standing on the corner doing nothing and they get caught up in somebody elses web
909417 if i could get 10 cats like him if i could get me 10 aarons id have no worries man aaron is god centered he has no ego he knows its not about him its about the kids
909418 its about knowing that if these kids are here playing baseball and we are here for them and we can see them theyre not out running in the streets risking getting caught in a crossfire
909419 strike him out baby and i got a shrimp for you
909420 where do you find unbiased objective news especially information on the presidential candidates and their views
909421 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
909422 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
909423 is not about producing more oil its really about producing more profits for big oil
909424 i would oppose drilling off the jersey shore or anywhere else that would pose a danger to the jersey shore
909425 there are hundreds of millions of acres available for drilling on shore in the united states and lots of acreage offshore in the western gulf
909426 we should be drilling there now to help relieve the pain for people driving their cars and paying so much at the pump
909427 i havent seen any information to date to lead me to conclude that the overwhelming cause of the high gas prices is anything other than high demand and flat supply
909428 i will have an open mind on the issue of adjusting the tax treatment for oil companies
909429 i think its definitely a time of change the players in four years are going to look a lot different than the players that have been around for the last 30 or 40
909430 i think its a great time of opportunity for people who want to be involved
909431 they may not have terrific name recognition today but they have credibility and connections within the political system and it wont take much for them to really break through
909432 coalition building seems like the default way to do things nowadays rather than the exception to the rule
909433 the fact that a number of city council people seem to be ready to go will just breathe more life into that momentum for change
909434 my feeling was you can trim it down a little bit so we are down to 10
909435 all we are trying to do is get it at the right size
909436 the kind of events the mayor attends and any threats over the course of the last few months our mayor is not one that likes a lot of tight security anyway
909437 dont do to another person what is disdainful to you
909438 in the beginning how to survive your engagement and build a great marriage

909442 in the beginning how to survive your engagement and build a great marriage
909443 thats not true change in a friendship doesnt necessarily signify its end
909444 your married friends just arent there for you any more they cant even return a phone call
909445 whether you let it whisper away gracefully or whether it dies in some sort of conflagration your married friends just arent there for you any more they cant even return a phone call
909446 is it true that lia and michael got engaged last night
909447 you know i am sorry i really wanted to tell you myself but time just got away from me
909448 you know er i tried to call you last night
909449 you know i had so many people to call my parents my rabbi
909450 i really didnt think youd call me before your parents
909451 why should you go when youll just sit there being miserable
909452 my fiance doesnt want me to ever talk to you again so this is goodbye
909453 the lives best lived are those that are dynamic always moving steadily forward always progressing and growing
909454 i need friends who are in the same place in their life as me spending time with the marrieds is killing my social life
909455 i didnt tell you sooner because i didnt want you to put doubts into me
909456 any time a so called friend is rude cuts you off and lies to you its time to cut your losses and move on you owe it to yourself not to be with people who treat you so poorly
909457 ill be your friend when i need you but not when i dont
909458 super special first in my heart first place friend at the head of the line of all my other friends
909459 its an extremely important position and one that can catapult a person into higher office
909460 except for the case of the d a mike nifong who prosecuted the duke lacrosse players its almost impossible to screw up as a prosecutor
909461 ive improved my visibility and on top of my good work as an assistant d a as inspector general i investigated corruption fraud and waste and educated the public on how they can get involved

909469 i feel horrible thats the thing i dont think people realize is how remorseful i am and how in five or six seconds five or six years has come crashing down thats the consequences of my actions but i wont let it be the last thing people remember me by as far as a player and as a person i lost my cool
909470 i am not going to run and hide but i am not going to allow this moment the paragraph or this chapter to define my book of life in the end

909472 you know when we were co stars i always told abhishek a world tour is something he must experience in fact for one of my world tours i had even asked my organisers to ask him to come onboard hed say not yet not yet and who would have thought when hes finally ready for his first world tour wed go together as husband and wife
909473 its a wonderful experience we have danced together on screen and also performed together but weve never been on a concert tour together even the audiences all over now respond to us as a couple they keep showering us with blessings and good wishes she said
909474 if theres a bottom line in this research its that delaying action carries a significant cost
909475 minor adjustments here or there aint going to cut it
909476 will occur once every 30 years or once every 40 years but were still designing as if they occur every 100 years
909477 the climate is more vulnerable than we thought were seeing changes faster than we expected to see them
909478 historically when we looked at the climate change challenge we asked how much it was going to cost to cut carbon emissions totaled the expenses and threw up our hands at the expense so we didnt do anything
909479 people in the boat community are usually very helpful they wave to each other and stop and help people this is not the norm people taking off like that

909485 the survey results show just how big a problem lack of sleep can be for some people and the havoc it can wreak on our personal lives
909486 the news reports are completely false and baseless there are no such plans
909487 newcastle united owner mike ashley is in talks with anil ambani the sixth richest man in the world and head of reliance communications indias biggest telecom company
909488 you can get a much lower rate below 8 percent of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on
909489 as things stand perhaps to look at a rate of inflation of 8 9 percent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
909490 i dont like this city with so much noise and pollution the roads are bad and the parks dirty i dont like the ragpickers and the vendors who shout at the top of their voice and the slum in the corner of my neighbourhood is so downmarket
909491 staying among a closed social group increases the sense of social segregation children staying in a community built with the same socio economic class tend to become comfortable with people similar to them and less tolerant of the world outside their closed gates
909492 that is the reason we advocate the inclusion of more socio economic classes in schools so that children have better social interaction and tolerance
909493 in such localities children have less interaction with the outside world which is in stark contrast with their gated abodes it is just a matter of lack of social interaction at a wider level
909494 these townships offer an escape from the pollution and traffic of overcrowded metros but eventually they also shut out the bleaker realities of other part of india which is not so pollution free not so secure and also includes slums
909495 we will invest 100 million in the next 12 months to launch six regional channels under the star brand in india
909496 we are unveiling the dow jones india titans a 30 stock index tracking the stock market performance of prominent indian companies
909497 it will be licensed to financial institutions as the basis of investment products such as exchange traded funds
909498 we have seen a re weighting of risk around the world but the world itself is being economically re rated and so we need an index that allows investors to take advantage of these changes
909499 the survey results show just how big a problem lack of sleep can be for some people and the havoc it can wreak on our personal lives

909532 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
909533 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
909534 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
909535 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
909536 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
909537 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
909538 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
909539 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
909540 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
909541 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
909542 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
909543 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt

909575 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
909576 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
909577 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
909578 we are going to be in this for the long haul
909579 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
909580 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
909581 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
909582 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response
909583 so far the turnout is high and there are no reports of any violence from anywhere in the country we have deployed over 20 000 policemen to prevent any violence
909584 there is a huge turnout of female voters because of the peaceful atmosphere
909585 thousands of voters gathered at the booths well before the voting began there is enthusiasm as these are the first polls in years and we havent had any reports of any untoward incidents
909586 it will send a positive signal to everyone that the country is heading towards free and fair polls in the third week of december this year

909588 we got quite a few complaints that some candidates have used black money to buy votes were investigating the allegations
909589 ive made the decision today to resign because i believe its in the best interests of the liberal party
909590 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of parliament and to the liberal party to make sure that we have every opportunity to win government
909591 i have formed a view a very strong view that we have a far better chance of election victory if theres a change
909592 theres no doubt that those issues have made it difficult for us as a political party to obtain the clear air that we need
909593 do those issues mean that i am uncapable or unfit to lead the state of western australia i dont think so
909594 however i have an obligation to the liberal party to do everything i can to rid them of this rotten government
909595 troy has worked hard as leader in difficult circumstances and has put the liberal party in a strong position to contest the state election

909671 following the recent end of telstras negotiations with the unions
909672 we believe that the best approach for us is to explore an employee collective agreement eca for those wholesale people who are employed on the current ea or an australian workplace agreement awa that has passed its expiry date
909673 the company started discussions with the unions with a view to negotiating a new enterprise agreement back in may the discussions went on for several months they went nowhere
909674 now were inviting them employees to sit down and talk to us about other issues that they would like to see dealt with in a collective agreement
909675 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflect the failure of the state to understand this complex problem it is alarming that the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
909676 this report underestimates the true numbers because it only includes those accepted by councils as a priority many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted those who ask for help are not always accepted as a priority and dont make any lists this is a largely hidden problem which these numbers only touch upon
909677 councils have to take more responsibility for these vulnerable people yes we need more houses but the government has to be more creative with the private sector if we are ever going to meet housing needs
909678 it has been virtually impossible for councils to build new homes because they cant borrow money on the open market
909679 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy our recent housing bill and the creation of the homes and communities agency will help to deliver council homes more quickly and will make it easier for councils to build their own social housing to meet the needs

909693 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it
909694 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision
909695 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
909696 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk
909697 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era
909698 we unfortunately have a culture among many young people to drink to get drunk and many people believe the more you drink the more popular you will be

909767 in terms of revocation policy would you object if i installed a driver on your system with a known bug that exposed k mode to unprivileged u mode code
909768 what is required is for microsoft to allow end users to explicitly sign their own drivers executables etc and be able to configure their own machines to trust their own signature
909769 would you object if i decided to install a driver on my own system with full knowledge of the consequences

909771 im uncomfortable with the idea of cas becoming the software police
909772 instead think of kernel mode code signing as default admin policy for the kernel that the admin can change if he wants to in analogy with my car im glad that my car has airbags that deploy by default i could disable them if i wanted but i generally choose not to i suspect that the large majority of users also feel similarly about default policy on a system i dont think that kernel mode code signing changes the admin god model in any fundamental way
909773 the security team at microsoft is investigating adding the revoked key to the kernel mode code signing revocation list as an additional defense in depth measure the kernel mode revocation mechanism requires a system reboot in order for the new revocation list to take effect which is consistent with other microsoft updates which require and subsequently trigger a reboot

909819 i hate it when people make it secondary to some political agenda or other
909820 if britain was a muslim country then that perspective would be reflected in politics through public opinion but its not and the two should be kept separate
909821 theres a natural tendency for the government to choose a group that says things it likes to hear and for groups to tailor their message to the government rather than represent opinion in the community but that means that groups which dont are pushed out when the point is to pull people in to engage with them
909822 i think theres little doubt that the 42 days legislation will convince many moderate muslims people who are our side that the government is basically against them it fits into the extremist narrative
909823 theres no doubt that muslims believe that 42 days is targeting at them as a group
909824 yet as well you have the most unlikely people stepping forward people from mi5 the police david davis theyre not just supporting us as muslims but supporting muslims as british citizens thats very comforting

909847 why in other words do people cheat in situations where there is little to gain one good grade a slight edge in a game and so much to lose this irrationality may be the rule rather than the exception when it comes to cheating according to a group of scholars who have turned their attention to the mysteries of the cheating mind cheating is often thought of as something that is done after cold calculation but the new research has found people are prone to cheat even when it is not in their best interest instead of carefully weighing the costs and benefits of breaking the rules people can be heavily swayed by peer pressure their mood their image of themselves sometimes people even cheat out of a sense of fairness
909848 clenbuterol has found popularity in bodybuilding and other sports where lean mass is desired athletes generally take a 20 mcg dose 3 times a day for 2 days then go off it for 2 days they repeat this cycle for 6 8 weeks the most prominant short term toxic effects athletes experience is heart palpatations insomnia and muscle cramping the long term side effect would include destruction of the adrenergic receptors permanant impairment of thyroid activity making the athlete unable to regulate his her metabolism and be intolerable to cold temperatures death the amount used by athletes are far less than what livestock are fed and still less than the residual clenbuterol found in meat from animals that were fed clenbuterol

909853 hardy has never tested positive before her swims at world champs are not in question people are acting like this negates anything she has ever done or will do i disagree
909854 more damaging however would be her lack of contributions in relay duty
909855 it is inconsistent with chemical metabolism as ive said before improbable not impossible for her to have had the drug in her body on the 4th but not on the 6th read submitted by swimmd
909856 don catlin former director of the olympic testing lab at the university of california at los angeles said any amount of clenbuterol in a urine sample is illegal he said it was possible for ms hardy to have a positive test between two negative tests because the drug has a half life of 35 to 40 hours and users can time dosages to the tests and hope the drug will no longer be in their system

909931 i was drawn to the subject by the universal graffiti impulse and the classic corny notion of freight train blues escape
909932 bill daniels homegrown epic is as kinetic and raggedly beautiful as the trains he hopped to make it using the search for the origin of a near mythical example of railroad graffiti as a point of departure bill made a film about freedom as literal passage across the land corporations brand things to say they own them but there are ways in which humans have marked things to say they cant be owned
909933 who is bozo texino is a great american movie and its greatness is tied up very closely with its american ness with this brilliant experimental documentary self styled hobo film maker daniel places himself firmly in the bootprints of jack london jack kerouac walt whitman woody guthrie a fine long tradition of american artists who look for their inspiration to the marginal the underclass the vagabond and the outcast nominally a chronicle survey history of boxcar graffiti a tradition as old as the railroad itself and the men who create it who is bozo texino soon transcends its narrow subject matter to become a gloriously rough edged elegy for an america which is being swept away before our eyes daniels film manages a near perfect union of radical form and radical content and it does so in consistently accessible style at first youre intrigued by the stunning monochrome images captured by his self effacing sensitively handled camera s by the startling kineticism of his fluent editing style by the sheer range of voices music and sound effects we hear as he tracks down a series of grizzled hobos and wisdom dispensing graffiti markers then you realize that just as these men have always instinctively rejected authority and convention daniel has likewise embraced the unorthodox in his style of filmmaking indeed in less than an hour daniel manages to say more about life art america and the simple joy of filmmaking than most directors manage in decades
909934 i am not going to hold back any enthusiasm it is the best movie i

909941 undeniably low maternal vitamin d affects the way the brain develops
909942 over the past four years weve been able to show that low vitamin d intake in animals during pregnancy results in offspring with brain abnormalities similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia
909943 the danes are only able to give us 1 6 microlitres of plasma so weve had to come up with a method of determining the vitamin d levels in that tiny amount of blood
909944 in collaboration with alun jones at the institute of molecular bioscience weve developed a way to easily measure low levels of vitamin d using mass spectrometry
909945 if we establish the link in this huge patient cohort we will be able to show that having low maternal vitamin d does not necessarily mean a child is going to develop schizophrenia but if a child has a particularly vulnerable genome the low maternal vitamin d may be the environmental trigger
909946 its the combination of gene and environment which triggers the disease
909947 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
909948 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
909949 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
909950 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
909951 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
909952 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
909953 we believe that the travel industry has an obligation to improve the quantity and quality of the malaria advice it provides and for independent travellers malaria advice should be provided by the airline for example on the ticket itself
909954 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
909955 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
909956 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
909957 you know a science experiment has arrived when a rap song extolling its virtues just hit
