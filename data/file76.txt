760000 he was covering a lot more ground than i was
760001 our emphasis was to get him as technically correct as possible and that took us over two seasons
760002 last year we concentrated on correcting his turn running making him more efficient around the curve i felt that i could significantly improve his 200m he was leaning inside on the turn and was unbalanced we got him to lean forward and that contributed to him developing a good first hundred
760003 if he gets stronger his stride frequency will improve and when we achieve that in perhaps the next two years he is going to run even faster
760004 when you break the world record people start saying stuff but it doesnt matter to me
760005 when you know youre clean it doesnt really bother you i know i am working hard so i have to assume they other athletes are working hard also
760006 i see asafa all the time so i know hes good he trains hard and works hard so i know hes clean and is doing the hard work every day we know there are athletes out there who work hard for what they want
760007 ive been running good since i was young the record is no surprise to me and other people i just run clean and try to do my best i try to lead by example
760008 you have to have 100 per cent faith in the taper
760009 i think a lot of other countries traditionally do too much training in the days before competition stopping goes against the grain doesnt it your big moments approaching yet youre doing less work and you dont know how youre going
760010 but the tapers been proven to work scientifically and its worked for me in the past even though i still have doubts two weeks out i have all these panicky thoughts oh gosh im not going to get there its not going to happen
760011 you just have to tell yourself relax theres no reason why this shouldnt work you have to buy completely into it because amazing things happen if i have two days rest i can go half a second faster than i was in training and half a second on the track is massive
760012 between the time i began to taper and the start of the championships there was an absolutely phenomenal change in my performance
760013 i probably only hit the speeds i hit at competition in manchester on two days in the entire year perhaps only on one day in a non olympic year
760014 when you come into a taper youre not damaging your muscles as much suddenly theyre recovering at a much faster rate and then finally on those last couple of days your body just has a chance to go whoah here we go but literally up until those last two days of rest you have no idea youre going to be going that fast you just have to believe its going to happen
760015 you can go into the race knowing that you were the fastest in the time trial but that doesnt mean youre going to beat your opponent far from it one tiny mistake and you might lose
760016 if i look over the wrong shoulder in my first round one stupid decision like that could mean it would be all over for me i could be the fastest rider and make one little wrong decision that would cost me everything theres no chance for a second attempt
760017 i was looking across at her and she couldnt make eye contact with me
760018 i was trying to put over the image of someone who felt totally in control and relaxed
760019 when i finished fourth at the 2004 world championships before the olympics i felt that i hadnt progressed
760020 i felt i didnt want to be doing something that i wasnt improving at i didnt want to do something at which i was only mediocre at the time being fourth in the world really frustrated me i felt i was wasting my time
760021 i hadnt anticipated the intensity of the situation in every aspect and as a consequence i under performed
760022 afterwards i just cried and cried i kept asking myself what am i doing why am i doing this i was extremely close to quitting
760023 when i met him i knew i needed somebody to help me
760024 ive told him this is my situation if you cant handle it im sorry because my priority at the moment is the bike over you thats because its only a short part of my life it may sound heartless but thats the reality of my situation
760025 i believe ive got the best guy available in the world working with me
760026 when i started track racing i did not know what i was doing
760027 jans taught me all sorts of tactics like forcing me to look only over my right shoulder and not to look forward until i commit thats a hard thing to do he actually said one day as he was riding behind me on the track you must look at me all the time if you look forward ill crash you it worked
760028 maybe im just vain but i really enjoy keeping my body in good condition
760029 coming from a sports background i know what i should and should not be eating but i dont ever deny myself cake or chocolate because i know ill burn off the calories because i work so hard
760030 if i feel like eating fish and chips i have fish and chips though obviously i wouldnt do it a day before a big training session its a great situation to be in how many females are lucky enough to be in my position where they can eat what they want and stay in the shape they want
760031 its a very fast track its steeper than manchester from a sprinters point of view its really fast because you can pick up a lot of speed coming down from the top of the track
760032 its virtually impossible to overtake on the bends but you have such a long straight that a lot can happen over that distance the finishing line is a long way down the straight much further down than manchester so your timing is really crucial if youre at the front you really have to hold on and accelerate towards the line there are a lot more opportunities to overtake in the straight than on most tracks
760033 a lot of the competitors at the world cup were struggling particularly in the endurance races
760034 when i got up after i fell one half of my body was covered in black because the track was so dirty you always get dust on a track no matter how much you clean it but it looked as though somebody had been rubbing it with charcoal when i slid along the track on my side i was completely black
760035 dont worry dear i put it away when i was straightening up thats what mothers are for
760036 a successful school does not hypertrophy it sows its seeds elsewhere
760037 that was because i couldnt stay on him he bucked me off three times in the first week
760038 natagora went far too fast for our leader but i got a good position anyway
760039 mine was looking about a bit in the final furlong but that is normal on a straight course and why i changed my whip
760040 she was able to follow the pace without being too keen
760041 she is an exceptional filly with a lot of speed
760042 we changed the game plan around and the guys executed that exceptionally well everybody involved in new zealand rugby the board the all blacks and the public wanted a big performance
760043 the secondhand car market dwarfs the market for new cars with around three vehicles sold for every one sold new each year rebranding existing cars could therefore have a bigger effect than increasing the differential for new cars
760044 ema has been a real success we will build on this and from next month every young person on ema will get financial support if they go on to university
760045 under labour there is really only one relationship which matters the relationship between the individual and the state
760046 the legacy that amir khan left us was that most of our clubs in great britain were suddenly filled up with asian boxers or any other boxer because they wanted to emulate amir khan
760047 and of course the funding agencies were very very willing then to give us money because they saw the potential
760048 a multitude of small policies and worthy initiatives that are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll
760049 if all our friends spend their time saying the leader is busted we should have a leadership election we should have all this that is the space that could be used to put labours case across
760050 tactically it was thought clever to define by reference to tb i e this was not the era of spin we are going to be honest the style would change etc
760051 the consequence was twofold we dissed our own record instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own 10 years a fatal mistake we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
760052 we took the benefit of the anti tb feeling but ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda
760053 the labour party is clearly split down the middle we have a government in chaos at a time when britain faces serious challenges we cant go on like this for another 18 months we need a general election sooner rather than later
760054 say what you like about the prime minister he at least managed to get the brazilians to accept a nama coefficient that will result in brussels accepting an 80 cut in europes most trade distorting farm subsidies
760055 it is obvious that a failure to address such concerns will reduce the opportunities for governments to pursue policies that permit societies to benefit from globalisation
760056 the interesting debate is affordability and does tfl have the money to do what it wants to do
760057 to stand still requires a huge amount of effort there is not sufficient robustness in the system to leave it alone it is still very fragile
760058 would have implications for our funding that would make it more difficult
760059 i would like to think that we can help through our ability to do project work in terms of value for money and certainty that the job will get done
760060 there were about 30 car loads of my family and friends who came to see me theyve got england flags all over the place it was crazy
760061 they had to give me my chance to qualify i felt
760062 i boxed the no1 cuban i beat him i boxed the no1 russian the european champion beat him i had to get my chance to be there and when i got it i took it
760063 given a fair wind and a bit of luck every one of the team could do as well as frankie
760064 billy joe is the youngest member of our team but in age terms he is very very mature hes a tough lad wed first identified him as a 2012 athlete and he still is were right on course for that the difference is that he may well be defending his gold medal in 2012
760065 we are true romany gypsies that is what we are if you go two three generations back to your great great grandfather hes most probably seen our people with the horse drawn wagons selling the old wooden pegs and things like that thats what the majority of people in this day and age dont understand
760066 and you cant tar all gypsies or travellers with the same brush i just need to get out there and prove to everybody that were not all the same
760067 i would love it to be that i could get young kids off the street and into the gym help them out i would love to think that i could do that
760068 its completely down to him if he decides he wants to take the boxing route he can and i will be supporting him all the way same as my dad did for me
760069 the secondhand car market dwarfs the market for new cars with around three vehicles sold for every one sold new each year rebranding existing cars could therefore have a bigger effect than increasing the differential for new cars
760070 the removal of a 30 stone male in advanced stage of decomposition
760071 there is nothing worse that having to deal with a decomposed body
760072 the psychological trauma that any human being goes through can have not only a significant impact on their working life but also within their family life
760073 the fairest mechanism of reward is to abolish the bonuses and special priority payments and have fairer national pay across the board
760074 we think the present system works well because it allows forces to reward unpleasant demanding or important work
760075 i think that it is very dangerous for the government to get involved in funding documentaries that deal with politically controversial topics such as this one on police community support officers
760076 it may be that there is sometimes a need for the government to make information films on other less controversial issues but it is crucial that these are clearly labelled as government backed projects
760077 documentaries of this nature play an important role in informing the public openly and transparently about the work of the police and uk border agency the home office does not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and they adhere to ofcoms strict guidelines on this kind of programme
760078 public information films used to state clearly at the beginning exactly what they were and i think if ministers are going to fund documentaries they must take a similar approach
760079 they think it will make a bad impression on foreigners
760080 but theres no point complaining because the authorities decided to do it i just hope it will come down afterwards
760081 whats the point in staying no one can even see my shop anymore
760082 look at how sanitised the g8 summits are its clear that certain individuals are not welcome but also that those involved are not supposed to see certain parts of their environment
760083 a lot of migrant workers are really second class citizens theres no room for them in shiny new beijing
760084 sake already has a very rich and full flavour and aroma so its best drunk with very simple food you dont need anything too robust
760085 personally i like drinking sake with italian antipasto or other mediterranean food
760086 she was very happy to see nice people she was ecstatic
760087 the interesting debate is affordability and does tfl have the money to do what it wants to do
760088 to stand still requires a huge amount of effort there is not sufficient robustness in the system to leave it alone it is still very fragile
760089 would have implications for our funding that would make it more difficult
760090 i would like to think that we can help through our ability to do project work in terms of value for money and certainty that the job will get done
760091 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to worship at the hilltop shrine
760092 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
760093 a lot of people were confined in a small area
760094 the core cause of the devaluation of human life in india is extreme population and limited resources managing such huge number of devotees will always be a risk as we cannot make thousands of worship places completely safe given our country is poor
760095 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to worship at the hilltop shrine
760096 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
760097 a lot of people were confined in a small area

760108 an initiative of those on the staff of the prime minister who take care of berlusconis image
760109 that breast and that nipple ended up right in the shots the news bulletins used for coverage of the press conferences
760110 i truly hope the decision to carry out this absurd crazy pathetic comic and useless retouching has been carried out without berlusconis knowledge all the more so if the idea was to do him a favour by not associating in the public mind a boob with someone who is how to say susceptible to female charm
760111 i dont deal with telephone intercepts with gossip with nonsense
760112 zapatero spains prime minister has formed a government that is too pink something that we cannot do in italy because there is a prevalence of men in politics and it isnt easy to find women who are qualified he will have problems leading them
760113 people will vote for la santanche because she is a beautiful babe
760114 ladies i have a mission for you on election day cook sweet and exquisite things please bring them to the polling station to be examined the boldest can try making a tart the most skilful profiteroles
760115 the left has no taste not even when it comes to women as for our women candidates being more beautiful i say that because in parliament they have no competition
760116 the best thing would be for you to find a millionaire
760117 i am obliged to remind you of a rule in the forza italia group the jus primae noctis
760118 if north american churches do not accept the need for a moratoria on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
760119 we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches
760120 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
760121 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
760122 it sends the wrong message that gays and lesbians are still strangers at the gate its not going to change anything on the ground
760123 magnificent in letting the world know about ronald reagans america
760124 expeditions had been waiting at base camp for up to two months for good weather
760125 they had all started together in one line k 2 is more dangerous than everest due to the loose rocks and avalanches
760126 these are big mountains and are dangerous at any time they take their toll every year mountaineering is a calculated risk
760127 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
760128 i paid a eulogy to catherine who i have known since she was a young girl in a welsh school
760129 i paid tribute to her personality her good life and of course such a talented person and respected by all who knew her we also sang a hymn which catherine would have sang at ysgol gyfun ystalyfera her school which talks about turning night into day
760130 the first 48 hours of any homicide investigation are critical
760131 weve passed that now were in for the long haul
760132 they are devastated everyone is two fine young people have been killed for no reason at all
760133 people ask if we alter the flavour of our sake to suit the american palate we do not we are just selling them sake that we believe is the best around
760134 whereas europe is traditionally wine country the us is not traditionally anything
760135 americans like their wine but its less established so the country is more open to new trends europeans taste sake and say yes its good and clearly a quality product but the next drink they have is wine
760136 but this too is slowly changing there is more potential in the uk and europe as europeans surely have a more refined palate than north americans
760137 young people who come here to drink my sake say they didnt realise it could be so good they thought it was an old mans drink
760138 the japanese are very concerned about what foreigners think of their country so if we have more success in the us market then japanese consumers may give it another try
760139 sake is finally coming into its own as a connoisseur beverage overseas so i do not think the novelty will wear off
760140 say what you like about the prime minister he at least managed to get the brazilians to accept a nama coefficient that will result in brussels accepting an 80 cut in europes most trade distorting farm subsidies
760141 it is obvious that a failure to address such concerns will reduce the opportunities for governments to pursue policies that permit societies to benefit from globalisation

760146 it sends the wrong message that gays and lesbians are still strangers at the gate its not going to change anything on the ground
760147 nigerian listeners are very sophisticated and they dont want any trash an album has to be really world standard before they will put out their money to buy it so you have to do your best work in the best studio
760148 a multitude of small policies and worthy initiatives that are more suited to a sunday afternoon stroll
760149 if all our friends spend their time saying the leader is busted we should have a leadership election we should have all this that is the space that could be used to put labours case across

760156 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist
760157 i think they are cynical their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
760158 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
760159 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
760160 what we democrats cant afford to do even as we support senator obama is try to build one america on the cheap
760161 people should not tell themselves i voted across the racial divide i have no obligations to do something in my community or around the world
760162 an initiative of those on the staff of the prime minister who take care of berlusconis image

760176 the department for culture media and sport agreement that governs the help scheme urgently has to be reviewed
760177 the help scheme should not open the floodgates for marketing practices and advertising of additional products or services to older and disabled consumers which can leave them stressed and confused
760178 it is inappropriate for the scheme to select as standard such a confusing commercial deal when it is geared to encourage vulnerable customers to opt for a potentially confusing or costly installation
760179 the dshs must never act as a trojan horse for pay tv services to be promoted to vulnerable groups
760180 we have made sure that what people get for their 40 is clearly set out in the options pack as well as what is extra and what is taken away after two months and that they are under no obligation to subscribe
760181 we are concerned that the sky deal does not meet the usability requirements that had been agreed with government and that were applied rigorously to other products
760182 we understand that sky are being allowed to offset product energy inefficiencies by providing energy efficient light bulbs to customers this makes a mockery of the governments own policy on the energy efficiency of electronic devices
760183 we call on the government to stop and think again the whole aim of this programme is to ease the transition for vulnerable groups not to make it more complex or costly
760184 sky is committed to making the help scheme a success in the border region
760185 can you give me some information about the arse midget
760186 far more wonderful and far more moving than any religious story of creation
760187 as i not only work on voiceovers but am also an actor i do of course act the role hopefully with the same ardour the same vocal expression every little breath and sigh
760188 i have not noticed any cultural differences in spooks although in german the mod is the verteidigungsministerium and that can lead to challenging situations during synchronisation
760189 coronation street was the first back in the 1970s when someone won a spot the ball contest and a gang headed off to spain
760190 but the form really picked up when eastenders sent angie and den to venice in 1988 for angie to reveal she wasnt really about to die
760191 broad appears to have it all sidebottom will presumably return for pattinson but a risk could be taken on jones if england really are to rediscover the cutting edge flintoff was supposed to bring
760192 it puts me in mind of old fashioned public school headteachers or army colonels speaking to their minions
760193 tony blair or sir bobby charlton at first mention thereafter mr blair sir bobby etc
760194 if people not normally given honorifics such as footballers are charged with criminal offences they are given back their titles for the duration of the case
760195 use just surname after first mention except in leader columns
760196 use common sense in a story where two people have the same name such as a court case about a husband and wife or brothers it may be necessary to use mr and mrs or ms or forenames
760197 theres an egalitarian aspect to this it treats everyone the same
760198 weve considered different rules for people who are not in the public eye
760199 honorifics can sound pompous and old fashioned but there are a small number of occasions when surnames have jarred with people
760200 if a teenager is killed for example you would expect to see his or her first name as always writers and subeditors are encouraged to use their judgment
760201 more likely than not that labour will have a new leader by the end of the year
760202 who has delivered a joined up message of hope for labour and its frustrated supporters
760203 exactly like the invisible staff who work in the toilet
760204 i cannot vouchsafe beyond peradventure that the information with which i am about to present you is truly authentic but here at least is the essence of what i believe i averred at the time
760205 then out spake brave horatius the captain of the gate
760206 that was obviously a theory at the time and its not for me to discount it but where is the evidence
760207 but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
760208 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality and knox hes a bit of me
760209 what have you got to go on why do you read it that way
760210 reading charles darwins the descent of man forces one to face an unpleasant truth that if everything he said in his more famous origin of species is true then it quite logically follows that human beings ought to ensure that the fit breed with abandon and that the unfit are weeded out
760211 what is their best evidence for a god their reply was a shameless exercise in longwinded vacuity could they possibly simply answer the question without babbling about the trinity and other such nonsense that even they admit they dont understand
760212 nor is there any evidence for or against evolution or creationism
760213 why do you take theists to task over the evidence for god
760214 what is their best evidence for a god their reply was a shameless exercise in longwinded vacuity could they possibly simply answer the question without babbling about the trinity and other such nonsense that even they admit they dont understand
760215 the belief that there is no god or denial that god or gods exist
760216 there is very good evidence for mutation and natural selection so youre boned on both meanings that you infer
760217 but can you link these phenomena to the emergence of highly organized structures processes or systems
760218 a person who believes that the human mind cannot know whether there is a god or an ultimate cause or anything beyond material phenomena
760219 it doesnt seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals and all the different planets and all these atoms with all their motions and so on all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that god can watch human beings struggle for good and evil which is the view that religion has the stage is too big for the drama
760220 blah de blah hate theists blah blah no direct answers blah blah sycophants will always agree
760221 you dont know any more about the subject than they do

760667 only by truly listening to the stories of soldiers whove come home can we appreciate the realities of war and what we can do to help
760668 all is lost in iraq will flock to your blog you feed them the poisonous fruit they crave
760669 bilal hussein belonged to a team of associated press photographers who received the professions highest award the pulitzer prize for their coverage of fighting in the iraqi city of fallujah in 2005 one year ago today he was seized by u s forces in iraq he has been held in continuous custody since that time
760670 u s officials indicated they lacked solid evidence on seven of the allegations and could not reveal the evidence they did have on the other two allegations because it was classified
760671 from my own examination of the case and discussions with u s representatives i was convinced that bilal hussein was seized and has been held in captivity for the last year for one reason the pentagon was embarrassed by the photographs he took of the fighting in al anbar province they contradicted the message the pentagon was putting out about the nature and scope of fighting in al anbar and senior figures in the bush administration were particularly galled that the ap won the pulitzer prize for its photographic coverage of the war the pentagon wanted to send a message to the entire press community in iraq cross us and we can just lock you up and we dont need reasons this is justice in the style of the bush administration
760672 i was kicked off my embed when a new unit i was to go out with suffered its first casualties
760673 i was locked in a room for hours and then told i was no longer welcome with unit
760674 its interesting how this is the only war since film arrived on the battlefield where it is considered
760675 4 the media employee agrees to a participate in the embedding process and to follow the direction and orders of the government related to such participation the media employee further agrees to follow government regulations the media employee acknowledges that failure to follow any direction order regulation or ground rule may result in the termination of the media employees participation in the embedding process
760676 8 the media organization and the media employee understand and agree that the government may terminate the embedding process at any time and for any reason as the government determines appropriate in its sole discretion
760677 clarke didnt deny that live coverage could possibly lead to american viewers seeing american soldiers die in battle
760678 thats why the president and others are trying so hard to exhaust every possibility so that armed conflict is a last resort
760679 such open coverage is only possible because media representatives and defense officials have spent countless hours drawing up media
760680 the assistant secretary refused to allow lauer to categorize such broad coverage as propaganda on the contrary she noted openness is the u s militarys way of countering iraqi propaganda
760681 douglas who hasnt the courage to post his full name but expresses admiration of me for posting mine condemns me for ad hominem attacks
760682 he overlooks my comment that when 68 of people oppose this war the concept of representative government has effectively been abbrogated
760683 further in contrast to you douglas my words are closely scrutinized as i live in u s militarily occupied okinawa where i share this island with 50 000 pawns in this misguided ill conceived genocide conceived by a evil coterie of liars and deceivers who have never served
760684 in contrast to you i know these guys i interact with them on a daily basis and they know my views quite clearly
760685 so my pro war porn afficionado who is it who walks the walk where the real battles are being raged and who is it hiding behind his glorified typewriter
760686 it may come as a surprise to you that many of these servicemen feel totally betrayed by the endless screwing theyve received at the hands of the chickenhawk republicans it also may surprise you to know how many are refusing the blood money offered for re enlistments and defying stop loss orders and it certainly will probably come as a shock to you when mccain and the whole republican hierarchy is resoundedly defeated soon
760687 all the while you live in a crude world of delusion that allows your sick mind to equate opposition to war with pornography that in itself speaks volumes about what a small minded little blood luster you really are
760688 mr aleshnick im sorry youre so full or anger and rage
760689 people like douglas like to report only what is favorable to them
760690 if we all constantly drive as if we were strapped to the front of the car like aztec sacrifices so wed be the first thing hit there would be a helluva lot less accidents
760691 that he hopes to see you again so he can smash your camera into your face
760692 we need to see the chicanery of those who would bring down the country that provides the greatest freedom to man ever known
760693 by the way last i checked there wasnt any combat action on okinawa
760694 aside from that i notice from your link that the cuban revolution was apparently a good thing
760695 my parents are shocked at what zoriah and i have experienced after posting zoriahs blog diary about the attack
760696 why are people in our united states military allowed to express hate or make violent threats against their own citizens without anyone stepping in to stop them
760697 when al qaeda attacked the world trade center and photojournalists documented americans dead and dying did we vilify the journalists how many members of the police force firefighters and military threatened journalists and tried to ruin their reputations because they had their cameras out and documented american deaths
760698 you are as j nachtway alex majoli alexandra boulat brave reportage good good job
760699 it is a eye opener to view your work it brings strong emotions when doing so your work reflects an other side of the world around us and beyond its a honour to be your contact and i will use it to find inspiration for myself thanks for sharing these pictures with us

760756 if brands are built over years why are they measured over quarters
760757 liveops is in essence adwords for people the platform is able to measure and manage each individual agent in real time and route calls based upon the performance of each agent and that routing doesnt simply rely upon data about the agent it also relies upon information about the call coming in if a call to the liveops service is to sell a ginsu knife the agent with the best track record of selling and up selling will get the call if on the other hand it is a call concerning front line product support a different agent may have the best record of quick and effective resolution of support matters

760761 an essential part of growing up adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
760762 the research shows that children need to experience challenging play in order to develop important life skills and to better manage risk and challenge in their daily lives
760763 however opportunities for children to take such risks are limited this is due to our risk adverse culture and an increase in health and safety constraints it is clear that we need to address the current cotton wool culture and to provide children with more opportunities for adventurous play
760764 whilst the impact of any call on the proposed nuclear indemnity could be very high there is only an extremely small possibility of the indemnity ever being used there is no commercially available insurance
760765 this technology is a potential asset in the fight against gun crime by notifying police as soon as a shot is fired it could save invaluable time in reaching a crime scene
760766 american police have mostly used this for area protection and to accompany visiting dignitaries
760767 part of its use is as a deterrent when criminals know they can be heard and found they are more likely to think twice before using firearms twenty nine different police forces wouldnt put their faith in technology that didnt work

760773 it is nonsense to suggest that tb tony blair is anything other than supportive of what gb gordon brown and the government are doing tb continues to give gb and the governments agenda his full support

760780 the costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production
760781 the price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production there will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive
760782 in this context it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process the concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers
760783 there is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly if just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non organic production we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies
760784 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers
760785 it is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and british produce people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade

760999 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
761000 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
761001 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
761002 if the united states ignores its legal obligations in this case it will be tough to argue that other countries should respect the rights of us citizens
761003 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
761004 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
761005 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
761006 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
761007 this is a time to especially if youre farther west assess where you are with your hurricane plan
761008 we are pleased with the completion of our credit facilities renewal and the continuing confidence in our company demonstrated by the banking community
761009 ninety percent of all banks that were part of the original conduit participated in the renewal the liquidity provided by these facilities will enable us to support our dealers and their retail customers
761010 i would like to thank our investors who have continued to support us through the renewal and i would like to acknowledge the skilled leadership of citi jpmorgan and the royal bank of scotland who led the syndication of the loan facilities and partnered with us to manage such a large transaction
761011 getting this world class financing done in this market is a validation of chrysler financial and chrysler their management and their strategic plans
761012 the depth and breadth of participation in this transaction was impressive particularly in the current market environment
761013 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
761014 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
761015 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
761016 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
761017 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
761018 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
761019 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

761034 astronomers were puzzled by the fact that the most extensively studied models of these disks couldnt quite be reconciled with some of the observations in particular with the fact that these disks did not appear as blue as they should be
761035 our understanding of the physical processes in the disk is still rather poor but now at least we are confident of the overall picture
761036 in the near future our new method may pioneer the way to address these questions

761079 taxpayers are paying more for two wars than they are for welfare
761080 the reason that taxpayer slavery affects every us citizen in a negative way is that just like when somebody steals from a store the prices must be raised in order to cover the losses
761081 run with the 13th amendment argument and lose the silly mudsling blanket hate for democrats it doesn t help
761082 while in the army i was probably living the most socialized way possible you don t pay for food shelter medical dental and they even issue you underwear you won t have to spend a dime of your paycheck to survive if you did not want to transportation anywhere you have to be is provided do you agree that the military should operate this way
761083 as one whose primary commitment is presumably to christ not the republicans im surprised that you make this comment all democrats like it like that even the christian ones even the former republicans
761084 how many more people would be saved today if they had no secular government to go to for help so they went to a church
761085 if a political party gains membership or support by welfare assisstance how does this differ to church membership increasing due to welfare assisstance being given by the churches
761086 i thought that people would or should be saved by the word of the lord alone

761093 why does it matter its the newsgroup concept mixed and reused
761094 exchanged views on the common challenges facing the two countries in terms of dealing with terrorism and militancy
761095 the prime minister and the president decided that their respective foreign ministers will meet to prepare grounds for a framework for close and constructive engagement between the two countries to build confidence and develop a common strategy at the political military and intelligence levels in collaboration with their coalition partners and nato isaf
761096 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
761097 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
761098 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

761109 what can be learned from karl marx everything about work and wealth in capitalism
761110 in etwa dasselbe vertreten wird wie schon decker auf deutsch
761111 no que es bien chafa y se bloquea la pantalla etc
761112 hegel ist nicht zu tadeln weil er das wesen des modernen staates schildert wie es ist sondern weil er das was ist f r das wesen des staats ausgibt
761113 volk das ist folgt man der praktisch verbindlichen festlegung moderner gesetzgeber nichts weiter als die gesamtheit der bewohner eines landes die die zust ndige staatsmacht zu ihren angeh rigen erkl rt diese bilden ungeachtet ihrer nat rlichen wie gesellschaftlichen unterschiede und gegens tze ein politisches kollektiv indem sie derselben staatsgewalt untergeordnet sind
761114 gesetzlichen l ge der konstitutionellen staaten da der staat das interesse des volks oder da das volk das staatsinteresse ist
761115 dass der staat die grundlagen ihrer interessen als lohnarbeiter kapitalisten exklusiv gegen andere gleichartige gemeinschaften durchsetzt ist das gemeinsame interesse der volksangeh rigen
761116 w hrend dieselbe l ge als regierungsgewalt etc entweder sich sofort aufl sen oder in eine wahrheit verwandeln m sste
761117 niemals wird aber die nation und die berechtigung ihrer interessen in frage gestellt
761118 und die zustimmung zu diesem zirkus ist auch nicht gleichbedeutend mit der beteiligung an staatszwecken oder gar ihrer setzung
761119 wie man bei wahlen sehr gut sieht wird periodisch ber das personal abgestimmt damit das dann
761120 die den widerspruch staat volk zu einer seite aufl sen will
761121 gesetzliche l ge der konstitutionellen staaten da der staat das interesse des volks oder da das volk das staatsinteresse ist
761122 aus dem unterschied zwischen macher und gefolgschaft resultiert jedenfalls kein gegensatz
761123 w hrend dieselbe l ge als regierungsgewalt etc entweder sich sofort aufl sen oder in eine wahrheit verwandeln m sste
761124 da schau her ein wille der unter gewaltandrohung zustande kommt soll der grund f r ein programm seiner eigenen sanktionierung sein
761125 dabei spricht marx eigentlich verst ndliches deutsch die tour von staatsm nnern
761126 auf die frage was herrschaft ist kommt auch prompt die antwort aus dem sozialkundebuch
761127 wenn ihr diese ansicht mit allen politikern teilt wei ich gar nicht warum ihr noch rumkritisiert dann ist doch alles bestens alle haben im kapitalismus genau das was sie wollen
761128 sagt auch keiner aber das bed rfnis nach einer sychellenreise und der staatliche eigentumsvorbehalt sind ein gegensatz
761129 der staat wei von seinem gegensatz zum volk und richtet sich mit entsprechenden gewaltmitteln darauf ein
761130 es bestreitet doch niemand die leistungs und opferbereitschaft n tzlicher idioten
761131 so ein unsinn als wenn ich oder irgendwer die demokratische staasr son nicht von der einer milit rdiktatur unterscheiden k nnte
761132 aber die schlussfolgerung dass obrigkeit ein werk ihrer untergeordneten w re bleibt im ausgangspunkt widerspr chlich
761133 gesetzliche l ge der konstitutionellen staaten da der staat das interesse des volks oder da das volk das staatsinteresse ist
761134 blo weil der staat mich als teil des volkes will ist das nicht die wahrheit der sache
761135 ihrem eigentlichen systemkritischen willen auf die spr nge helfen ist weltfremd
761136 als h tte er seine gewaltmittel um sein volk knechten zu k nnen das gefangenenlager l sst gr en
761137 das volk wird nicht dazu gezwungen volk zu sein das ist schon ihre eigene willensleistung
761138 wann wurde denn je herrschaftspersonal vom volk beauftragt es in den krieg zu schicken
761139 da schau her ein wille der unter gewaltandrohung zustande kommt soll der grund f r ein programm seiner eigenen sanktionierung sein
761140 ein satz zuvor h ltst du den staat noch f r ein gefangenenlager das seinen h ftlingen mit gewalt den willen zum staat einbleut

761156 the recent opening of the lhasa qinghai railway connecting tibet to china has led to economic development and an improvement of living standards
761157 during the misnamed great proletarian cultural revolution that began in the mid 1960s in which mao mobilized millions of student youth to buttress his position in an intra bureaucratic factional feud mao subjected the tibetans to fierce great han chauvinism tibetan language and native dress were proscribed much of what had been at the core of tibetan culture was simply smashed up and destroyed although with the beneficial side effect of driving monks into actual labor
761158 the truth is that because of poor transportation and the huge distances involved only a limited number of han red guards actually reached tibet
761159 surely these actions are evidence that once they realized they could control their own fate the tibetan peasantry in an unequivocally liberating gesture cast off the spectre of the afterlife that had hung over them for so long and forcefully asserted that they would rather be men in this life than souls in the next

761205 is china capitalist socialist i dont know i have no idea
761206 we insist that china remains a workers state since the 1949 revolution albeit bureaucratically deformed by stalinist parasitism and mismanagement
761207 so we stand for the unconditional military defense of china against imperialist attack and internal counterrevolution interruptions from chair the latest evidence of which can be seen in these counterrevolutionary riots in tibet we think theres only two ways forward two ways for china either its going to be integrated into the capitalist world economy as subservient as in the pre revolution days as colonials of the imperialists loud interruptions or there is going to be a proletarian political revolution to oust the stalinist bureaucracy

761221 somebodys eventually got to take on this monster mind boggler and one of the three men lined up to run for governor next year will clearly have to come up with a solution or spend four years trying
761222 dissidenz hier geht einiges aber schon noch ziemlich durcheinander aber vielleicht solltest du z b nochmal in den mew nachschlagen wie lohnarbeit und kapital zusammenh ngen
761223 die antideutsche szene wenn es diese berhaupt noch gibt wird sich spalten das ist richtig aufgabe der antideutscher kritik ist es aber die b rgerliche gesellschaft zu sch tzen und wo sie noch nicht existiert sie einzufordern der b rgerliche individualismus stellt bis dato das einzige wirksame gegengift gegen den kollektivismus dar die mittel zur durchsetzung fehlen nat rlich in aller regel daf r gibt es den n tigen pragmatismus antideutsch ist also was der b rgerlichen republik n tzt der nat rliche freund des antideutschen kommunisten ist also nicht die linke sondern der klassische liberalismus wem das nicht passt der kann sich ja in die antikapitalistische volksgemeinschaft eingliedern
761224 der nat rliche freund des antideutschen kommunisten ist also nicht die linke sondern der klassische liberalismus
761225 wenn man den zweck hat eine auf bed rfnisbefriedigung ausgerichtete planwirtschaft hinzustellen dann arbeitet man eben auf den hin und nicht auf einen kapitalismus
761226 woher wei t du denn so genau da du morgen auch noch auf das z hlen darfst was dir jetzt als n tzliche bedingungen erscheint
761227 phantasie geh rt zur entscheidung zur anpassung offensichtlich unbedingt dazu
761228 du wirst doch nie im leben mal die preisform durchnehmen oder sagen was ein wechselkurs zwischen deutschland und der t rkei ist was ein waffenexport ist das willst du doch gar nicht wissen
761229 we should resume normal operations by the end of september
761230 modifications were initiated on the hawk engines because of sufficient multiple instances of low pressure turbine blade loss in flight
761231 the next jet graduation is scheduled for the end of september and the school might be able to make it close to that mark
761232 those dates are a little bit flexible because theyre dependent on weather and aircraft availability
761233 then imagine opening the door and being jabbed in the chest by his index finger facebook user it should on facebook this sort of moronic behavior happens all of the time and for some reason because its happening on line its deemed socially appropriate today a friend sent me the
761234 everyone loves food and no wonder we are a nation of food lovers
761235 our interest isnt limited to the practical requirements of nutrition either
761236 r esearchers must also be concerned about the replicability its repeatability with the same results
761237 they cant write because they havent read anything all they do is watch tv
761238 television is something students know that they feel confident about that they are sure they can talk about with authority
761239 the goal of this book is to make writing teachers more aware of and responsive to the ways that television is already influencing their students writing and to show teachers how to draw upon certain critical discursive abilities their students possess but that have generally been dismissed and ignored
761240 too often student views are conspicuously absent from work that addresses issues of mass popular culture and student writing for me it was politically important in this project to let students have their say rather than simply treating them as ill informed dupes of dominant ideological forces
761241 in the field of composition we have an ethical obligation to practice and teach the communicative forms that are in the center of our culture as well as the valuable forms that exist on the margins
761242 daniel parejo has been loaned to queens park rangers for one year
761243 the youth team midfielder will therefore play in the football league championship next season where he will continue progressing and honing his skills
761244 what we as editors value is the bringing together of the ethnographic with a focus on literacy as a social practice and multimodality with its emphasis on the variety of communicative practices in other words we see identity and social practice in the materiality of texts
761245 jeweils unten auf der seite der einzelnen sendtermine steht wo der vortrag der dialog archiviert ist ver ffentlicht also ffentlich zug nglich gemacht wird er allerdings erst nachdem ich ihn gesendet habe
761246 wenn ein urteil ber seine werke eben nicht nur der eigenen glaubensgewi heit ber die erz hlk nste der club autorit ten abgelauscht werden will
761247 wie der gsp die kunstideologie kritisiert also kunst sei die stellung zu ihr z b trifft denke ich mal bei dir auf zustimmung oder
761248 kunst ist das verh ltnis das man zu einem objekt der kunst einnimmt
761249 woher willst du denn wissen dass kafka immer das gleiche zeug geschrieben hat wie in
761250 auch ein vortrag enth lt material nur mal so m glicherweise reichts mir sogar aus
761251 du h k mit deinem identit tsstiftenden nicknamen mit freier endsilbe hast noch nicht einmal meine veralberung deiner selbstnamensgebung bemerkt als ich dich der l cherlichkeit die noch nicht einmal zum lachen sei zieh weil du den epilog offensichsichtlich schon deshalb gar nicht wahrgenommen hast weil ihm das etikett er sei von der mg bzw dem gsp selbst fehlt
761252 diskutiert wird ja nur was und wie und wozu ist der allein relevante und kritikable streitpunkt
761253 warum sollte eine kommunistisch inspirierte agitprop gruppe einen begriff der kunst haben au er um dir einen gefallen zu tun
761254 er h tte meines erachtens seiner pflicht als moderator gen gen und krim amp libelle aus eben genanntem grunde schon l ngst des platzes verweisen m ssen
761255 da leider die linken in westeuropa er hat das 1984 gesagt sich eher gedanken zur metaphysik machen als ber die profitrate
761256 lies doch mal ein buch von der mg ber den profit
761257 weil sie sich als linke konkurrenzposition in irgend einem interessenkampf auffassen
761258 weitere diskussion um den ber hmten alten kunst k nstler artikel der mg werde ich auch nicht mitmachen den kenne ich nicht mal das verbuche ich unter intellektuellen luxus
761259 z b hier das h tte dir auch schon mein freund google sagen k nnen
761260 warum die mgler den jetzigen gsplern nicht ihre ganzen sch tze mit auf deren weg gegeben haben warum der eine haufen selbst jetzt h ufig nichts vom anderen wei da verwundert mich auch mal um mal ich hatte auch mal buchst blich jahre zu tun bis ich auch nur den referenten einer veranstaltung identifiziert hatte
761261 nein der gsp hat nicht nur einen falschen artikel geschrieben ich habe schon mindesten drei artikel kritisiert die sind aber leider beim einstampfen des mdf forums verlorengegangen dann habe ich es aufgegeben gegen windm hlen zu argumentieren au erdem hatte ich keine lust mehr dazu hinter deren borniertheit hinterzuargumentieren schlie lich bin ich nicht der theoretische abfallbeseitiger des gsp
761262 wiewohl die dignit t des werks immer und grunds tzlich f r sich selbst spricht
761263 auch habe ich wenig zeit brig f r die w rdigung der dignit t von kafka amp werk ich achte lieber darauf was er inhaltliches zu sagen hatte
761264 diskussion ist n mlich nichts anderes als eine paraphrase f r die standpunkt und auch ichbezogenheit des meinungsaustausches meinungsabtausch
761265 wie er meint meint seine betonte l ssigkeit im methodischen zugang auf das ihm inhaltlich noch gar nicht vertraute nichtsdestoweniger und dem stand seiner arbeit zum trotze dem erweckten anschein nach umgangsm ig schon halb gefressene thema demonstrieren zu m ssen
761266 er h tte meines erachtens seiner pflicht als moderator gen gen und krim amp libelle aus eben genanntem grunde schon l ngst des platzes verweisen m ssen
761267 beide mi brauchen diesen thread soweit sie sich nicht auf kafka beziehen um per trittbrettfahrerschaft wieder einmal ihre mg gsp schelte i s kunst und stalinismus und berhaupt loszuwerden
761268 bitte schlie lich gehts um kafka und der geh rt zur kunst und schlie lich hat mich helden karl gefragt
761269 ach daher weht der wind und warum nochmal h tte er das tun sollen weil ich einen richtigen kunstbegriff habe und der gsp einen falschen oder weil du meinst offene rechnung begleichen zu m ssen weil du als multiple id hier schon mal geflogen bist
761270 in kunstfragen hat der gsp eh keine ahnung bei diskussionen zu kunstthemen wird mir regelm ig mit demonstrativem desinteresse begegnet da wird so getan als sei kunst f r kommunisten generell der befassung unw rdig kaum kramt aber einer uralten mist vom eigenen haufen aus sind alle ganz scharf drauf
761271 vortreffliche pers nlichkeiten die sich hier um unverwechselbarkeit bem hen bringen es im besten fall zu einem l cherlichen effekt ber den keiner lacht sie subsumieren sich selbst nach strich und faden unter ihre hohe aufgabe
761272 diskussion ist n mlich nichts anderes als eine paraphrase f r die standpunkt und auch ichbezogenheit des meinungsaustausches meinungsabtausch
761273 zun chst m chte ich festhalten da ich keine offene rechnung mit krim zu begleichen habe vielmehr mich seine ein und auslassungen soweit ich sie mitbekomme f r gew hnlich herzlich wenig interessieren
761274 wie ich berhaupt tunlichst vermeiden m chte mit ihm auch nur irgendwelche ber hrungsfl chen zu haben
761275 beide mi brauchen diesen thread soweit sie sich nicht auf kafka beziehen um per trittbrettfahrerschaft wieder einmal ihre mg gsp schelte i s kunst und stalinismus und berhaupt loszuwerden
761276 ein forum ein blog hat spielregeln diese spielregeln m ssen eingehalten werden um einen rationalen disput berhaupt zu erm glichen und einiger ma en stringent und diszipliniert f hren zu k nnen wer sich an eine regel nicht h lt der fliegt f r das stattfindende spiel eben raus
761277 soll das jetzt so weitergehen bis auch noch der letzte die lust verliert
761278 da hier nicht allzuviel diskutiert wird was ja offensichtlich ist liegt sicherlich zuletzt an clara
761279 f llt eigentlich noch jemand auf dass wenn hier diskutiert wird praktisch keine inhaltliche diskussion mehr stattfindet
761280 krim f llt eigentlich dir nicht auch auf da es f r eine provokation immer zwei braucht h ufig sogar nur einen den provozierten
761281 eine abschlie ende urteilsbildung ber einen autor sollte tunlichst ber originallekt re stattfinden ber sekundarliteratur wie einen vortrag ist eine urteilsbildung bestenfalls unvollst ndig du beurteilst nicht die originalen gedanken des autors sondern eine rezeption aus zweiter hand
761282 also eine diskussion ber kafka ist unvorstellbarer luxus aber die diskussion ber die vorabver ffentlichung eines kafkavortrags nicht
761283 terga caput tangunt colla intercepta videntur spina viret venter pars maxima corporis albet limosoque novae saliunt in gurgite ranae
761284 eine gesellschaft in der die leute ihre beziehungen wissenschaftlich regeln
761285 sie behaupten alles im namen der wiederherstellung gesch digter interessen zu tun
761286 beharrt man darauf dass irgendein interesse z b urlaub auf den seychellen zu gehen h tte dann macht man nie und nimmer eine revolution
761287 betreibt eben mit einem falschen argument etwas ganz anderes als er vorgibt zu betreiben
761288 ihr bestreitet dass im kapitalismus und kommunismus verschiedene interessen existieren
761289 das lohninteresse wird von euch nicht zur ckgewiesen sondern als berechtigtes arbeiterinteresse zun chst einmal anerkannt
761290 ihr macht ihnen ein angebot wie dessen realisierung am besten vorankommen k nnte

761293 brians strong performance lays the groundwork for an impressive statewide finance effort and a successful campaign
761294 so all problems with vista are due to third parties foolish at least and what about launching a new only 18 months after releasing the product needless to say microsoft claims vista is perfect and users love it but a vocal minority
761295 let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone
761296 claiming that people who have problems with vista are idiots and people who couldnt make it work wont bring any good to the cause
761297 classic undocked is a challenging thing given the architecture of the galileo ide frankly id like to drop it but i know that would cause a major meltdown
761298 i have my criticisms of your political tendency but in terms of substance rc is miles ahead of most of the garbage on the anglophone left which is why its such a shame that the translations are so substandard its a discourtesy to your potential audience
761299 american gsplers are learning to write like their german role models
761300 the allegation of some sort of logical inconsistencies in argumentation
761301 i swear they must have a cadre school where they all learn to write like that
761302 dass die kritik von m glichst vielen aufgenommen wird hat ganz unabh ngig von sprachhindernissen eine h here aussicht auf erfolg wenn diejenigen welche sie verbreiten alles inhaltlich durchdrungen und bernommen haben bevor sie es mit anderen teilen
761303 eine feige arrogante ignorante art und weise eines kommunisten einfach nicht w rdig
761304 gesetzliche bestimmung wo alles klar ist sobald jemandem der versto dagegen nachgewiesen
761305 aber praktisch sind deine ausf hrungen wohl auch nicht gemeint
761306 es ist bezeichnend f r die diskussion in eurer forenwelt da zielsicher nach 5 beitr gen der gegenstand komplett gewechselt wird
761307 brian s statewide support is impressive he s getting help from people across the entire commonwealth because democrats realize he has a strong record and the best chance to win in november of 2009
761308 brian s strong performance lays the groundwork for an impressive statewide finance effort and a successful campaign
761309 i am humbled and encouraged by this support and the generosity of my friends both new and old
761310 it has been a pleasure to get to know virginians in every corner of our commonwealth citizens who truly care about the direction of our state the response has been amazing
761311 to survive ive taken the first job that comes along but that usually doesnt pay enough for me to be able to keep up with my bills
761312 going to college just may be the best thing for me to do right now if i dont find a job soon
761313 one of our goals at bryant and stratton is to provide students and the community at large with opportunities to explore different career paths
761314 an event like this allows us to build relationships between the community and employers and help graduates find jobs locally
761315 we are looking for motivated people who bring pride and passion to the job
761316 even if you start at an entry level position if you have these qualities and are committed to the job we will promote you
761317 its a very competitive market right now because many people who once held middle management positions have been let go and they are competing for the same jobs as i am at a reduced salary to them
761318 banks are going under or being taken over by other companies its a very cutthroat business right now
761319 its been really difficulty trying to find a job through the traditional temporary agencies
761320 im hoping to find something that will be somewhat of a perfect fit here at this event
761321 for high school graduates who are not sure if college is for them we offer an alternative choice recruitment numbers are definitely up
761322 learning is a lifelong process whether its on the job or in the classroom its all important
761323 ein durcheinander der werte wenn berhaupt noch welche da sind
761324 i want to be the next president of the united states
761325 its not the turkish people we greeks dislike its their government
761326 this isnt working time to start over lets start by having a tea party
761327 i cant care about what our government does all over the world i have to trust that they know what theyre doing
761328 the first overarching big problem is to make the good person we must have better human beings or else it is quite possible that we may all be wiped out and even if not wiped out certainly live in tension and anxiety as a a species
761329 the hind legs of the tiger are longer than the forelegs
761330 the state of being confined to a space from which it is difficult or impossible to escape the same used in a figurative sense like for example female captivity as allegorically portrayed in the gilded cage
761331 keeping wild non domesticated animals in menageries zoos aquaria marine mammal parks for various reasons
761332 hey whats up my name is carlos im portugeese and brazilian im 16 i love my life but its gonna get better i want to be dj someday i hang with the family and my true homies play basketball and go out to the movies and partyharder then a rock star only sumdayz wen i have my days off of work im just a laid back guy looking for some cool new friends so if anyone wants to talk just say wat it doo doo
761333 the nice thing about a zoo is that you can put your arms around it he says from san francisco chronicle
761334 at the news conference zoological society chairman nick podell lavishly praised the
761335 the very public tragedy overshadows decades of problems and the troubles of the current zoo administration
761336 it would appear that his management style which downplays the value of staff and the welfare of animals remains in place
761337 the boys especially the older one were roaring at them he was taunting them
761338 they were trying to get that lions attention the lion was bristling so i just said come on lets get out of here because my kids were disturbed by it
761339 as a result of this investigation police believe that the tiger may have been taunted agitated by its eventual victims
761340 this factor contributed to the tiger escaping from its enclosure and attacking its victims
761341 when they got down they heard a noise in the bushes and the tiger was jumping out of the bushes on him paul dhaliwal
761342 in the meantime i cant get out of my head the parents of those youngsters and how they brought them up is it so difficult to teach your child some basic rules for life
761343 theyre untouchable knowing most people will be intimidated by their lack of respect and willingness to be confrontationa l unfortunately for this boy tigers dont know that
761344 hey lady we dont want to fight with a pregnant woman
761345 why not if youll taunt a innocent boy who cant defend himself why not a pregannt woman
761346 instead they will hire a lawyer go on talk shows and become famous is that screwed up or what
761347 my parents divorced when i was eight and my father never made any attempt to stay in contact with me he died of a heart attack when i was 19 it seems a shame and something i feel some small guilt over though intellectually i know very well that it was his responsibility being the adult to be a father to me not mine to be a child to him

761353 homogene gruppen zusammengefasst werden die h her niederwertig sind und gegeneinander k mpfen
761354 sie enstammt aus der bewusstseinsm igen verarbeitung der gesellschaftlichen bewegung und nicht aus der objektiven wirklichkeit
761355 weltbilder und die objektive wirklichkeit sind begriffe die beide defizit r sind
761356 die vorstellung es g be die wirklichkeit auf der einen die weltbilder auf der anderen ist selbst ein weltbild
761357 die wirklichkeit auf der einen und die weltbilder auf der anderen seite
761358 warum benutzt du also einen begriff der angeblich defizit r ist
761359 die vorstellung es g be die wirklichkeit auf der einen die weltbilder auf der anderen ist selbst ein weltbild
761360 die wirklichkeit auf der einen und die weltbilder auf der anderen seite
761361 aber wenn hier das thema auf den tisch soll meinetwegen meinst du das jetzt an dieser sozialwissenschaftlich berlegten differenz an die wendy und lysis ankn pfen also kulturalismus und biolog rassismus oder ganz allgemein
761362 wenn es eine objektiven standpunkt in der naiv unkritischen version die hier st ndig pr sentiert wird g be
761363 dann k nnte der eindruck dass die welt nicht objektiv aber nicht aufkommen das w re dann l ge o
761364 woher nimmst du dann deine sicherheit dass man sich in der beschreibung der welt so unsicher sein muss
761365 es gibt darauf zielte meine bemerkungen jedenfalls verschiedene begriffe und vorstellungen davon was
761366 es gibt objektivit t im klassischen sinne dass hier ein subjekt steht dem ein objekt als gegenstand der erkenntnis gegen bersteht nicht
761367 und weil es der letzte stand meiner einsichten ist sicherheit habe ich aus keinem anderen grund als dem letztgenannten
761368 dass wir hier das objekt haben und da ein subjekt dass das objekt immer besser bestimmen kann
761369 das w re wohl nur so wenn cds und herzklappen die einzig m gliche richtung menschlichen fortschritts bedeuten w rden auch der buschmann dessen vorstellungen ohne eurozentrisch klingen zu wollen f r mich eher wie gequirlter mist erscheinen bekommt ja mit diesen einiges gebacken
761370 das hei t nicht dass alles nur beschreibunb ist sondern das ein begriff immer die erfahrung von etwas im kontext von urteilen begriffen und vorstellungen auf die man zur ckgreifen muss ist
761371 entwickeln sich meine einsichten nicht am objekt sondern durch das was ber die welt zu sagen mir sinnvoll erscheint
761372 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
761373 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
761374 the security situation has deteriorated and there is very limited access for united nations and partner agencies to provide humanitarian support
761375 we have had to build the capacity of our local partners local ngos who work on the ground and live within communities in insecure areas because even our somali national staff have no access to many areas now
761376 some of these organisations are doing amazing work continuing to provide awareness and other services amid shelling and insecurity
761377 we run the woman to woman hiv aids programme using 24 facilitators to sensitise women about hiv
761378 we hold assemblies where women talk about hiv related issues we counsel people living with hiv refer people for vct and go house to house doing education
761379 its dangerous we have to keep a very low profile in order to avoid being harassed by the militias
761380 we dont go to the frontline the areas where the tfg transitional federal government the ethiopian troops and the insurgents are fighting
761381 we are also careful about what time we carry out activities
761382 in the morning before the khat a mild stimulant widely chewed in the horn of africa arrives in the market the militias are alert and can harass our staff about what they are doing and whether they have the authority to do it but in the afternoon when most of them have gone to chew the khat we can move around more freely
761383 recent shelling in beletweyne 330km north of the capital mogadishu displaced some of our facilitators and peer educators so their work had to stop
761384 they just put me into a job network but the job network was not helpful it is a possibility people from african backgrounds are not given a chance
761385 filimkan oo ay si wada jir ah usoo saareen nfb iyo instinct films waa mid soo jiidan doono qalbigaaga filimkna wuxuu soo bandhigayaa sheekada nargis jibril iyo labadeeda gabdhood oo la kala yiraahdo asha iyo sagal waxuuna u soo bandhigayaa si sheeko iyo riwaayad isku dhafan oo ka duwan sida filmada kale loo soo bandhigo
761386 blessed are those who are red sox fans for they shall be will be considered champions
761387 the current environment of conflict displacement and insecurity in southern and central somalia has a seriously negative impact on childrens and young peoples long term psychosocial welfare and healthy development
761388 of further concern are the recruitment of children and their participation in the conflict which have also resulted in children becoming suspects and targets in the conflict
761389 unicef with the support of its partners is carrying out an advocacy campaign against child recruitment and is working with communities through child protection networks throughout southern and central somalia to monitor and report on violations against children
761390 unicef calls on all parties involved in the conflict to respect international humanitarian law safeguard the rights of children prioritize their welfare and safety and seek solutions to increase humanitarian access
761391 i had all sorts of people coming up to me and saying they wanted to better understand somali culture and history
761392 i wanted to write a book which was easy to understand by kids grown ups intellectuals and a book appealing to all members of society so it was not an easy task
761393 i had such diverse letters from all kinds of respected people it was amazing and gratifying at the same time
761394 i paid every single penny of the costs and publication of this book and i did not receive any help from anyone we printed 1 000 copies and hardly any remain
761395 if their control of guns is at best weak or nonexistent then the agreements will not be a solid foundation for a peacekeeping operation
761396 how can you say no when you are the last resort
761397 favourable to the spanish initiative within the framework of an exercise that is at a minimum european if not international
761398 the ethiopian forces ousted the uic but have been bogged down since then fighting an iraq style insurgency by somali islamist and clan militias
761399 the ars shall through a solemn public statement cease and condemn all acts of armed violence in somalia and disassociate itself from any armed groups or individuals that do not adhere to the terms of this agreement
761400 the alliance for the restoration of peace and counter terrorism
761401 the whole purpose was to divide the ars and strengthen the enemy of our nation unfortunately some of our members were trapped by those who wanted to deepen the division
761402 the so called agreement in djibouti only legitimized ethiopian occupation of somalia and the continued destruction of lives and property
761403 whatever tfg gets they have been promised to get equal share
761404 there were two main factions that opposed the djibouti agreement which has seen none of its main provisions implemented for whatever reason it also added another faction into the deadly equation of the somali question
761405 on issues relating to the political cooperation between the parties and concerns over justice and reconciliation
761406 to authorize and deploy an international stabilization force from countries that are friends of somalia excluding neighboring states
761407 the establishment of a united nations peacekeeping operation in somalia should be based on a viable political agreement between the parties and the stabilization of the situation on the ground
761408 without a demonstrated commitment to peace by the somali parties it will be extremely difficult to generate a credible stabilization force to relieve the ethiopian forces in mogadishu
761409 no past or present foreign forces brought us peace and stability but we made semblance of stability which no foreign forces could ever bring no matter how strong the foreign troops
761410 they foreign forces were here with thousands of troops in 1992 but they left us as hopeless as ever they will do the same if they come again just like the ethiopian troops who are killing raping robbing everything in their path
761411 in the event of the collapse of the djibouti agreement and that is inevitable somalia will sink deep into the abyss of chaos lawlessness and perpetual violence if all foreign forces do not withdraw and allow the local people to come up with their own indigenous solutions like they did before in mogadishu puntland and somaliland
761412 tell them to leave us alone we have suffered so much that we can now find our way out like we did before
761413 and every one of them is a killer if you kill enough people you are called a warlord and you get invited to conferences meanwhile i was elected by thousands of votes in a free election but the international community does not consider us a country they should be rewarding democracy not killing
761414 olha me este gajo que com uma queda quase que me limpava
761415 its a cycle of madness because each generation is doomed to repeat because no generation is equipped from the previous generation that is how i came to forgive my parents because i took at look at the parents they grew up with and so on and realized that all parents are trying to do the best they can with what they got given i know a lot of fathers are trying to find their way in the dark
761416 one could argue that religion has killed any thought that other ways of rearing children might actually work
761417 football is a prime example but now that we are forbidden from expressing the testosterone fuelled aggression
761418 a tv series i saw recently defined bravery as a guy who wakes in the morning looks at his wife and kids and does not run away that is the root of our fear we all want to run away no one likes responsibility
761419 you think a guy holding a gun is tough guy no the guy who gets up early everyday and goes to work then comes home to his family thats the real tough guy
761420 what would l be doing what did i miss out on
761421 because you dont think anything with which you disagree merits any discussion on anyones part or mulling over on
761422 in greece i used to grab all my friends hug them kiss them slap them etc here in california if i did that to my friends they woud be worried that i was trying to hit on them and when i hug my own stepfather his face turns red yet hes guy in a milllion hed do anything for me anything to help anybody
761423 look mom we are not going to cry at a sad movie sorry it would be embarrassing
761424 but they have to live and work in the world outside our family and guys dont go to the movies and cry in that world valid emotion or not
761425 and there is the overcompensation factor making up for a barely there father who had his own issues with this messy emotional business
761426 should i open the door for a date a female colleague who now might even be my boss there was also should i pay for this meal or will she be offended should i let her pay if she offers and risk looking cheap
761427 our understanding of what equality of the sexes means needs to broaden
761428 its not personal dammit stop planting deer food and they wont come
761429 tim ill have to let you go weve got another deer emergency
761430 shes not dead shes probably just resting and im fairly certain there is no fawn
761431 i may not have been raised on a farm but im

761433 well have to approach very quietly or we might scare it
761434 listen if that doe died after giving birth she probably was too old or too sick to survive it that might mean she wasnt able to feed this little thing either and thats not good if animal services cant get any milk into her she wont make it

761546 look i didnt know look i think that you guys should take a step back and look at this look dod has made a decision theyve decided to stop this program
761547 scant credible evidence that iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al qaeda
761548 saddams regime is intensely secular and is wary of islamic revolutionary movements moreover baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control
761549 in desperation saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al qaeda
761550 sporadic wary contacts with al qaeda since the mid 1990s rather than a relationship with al qaeda that has developed over time
761551 if iraq regimes sic continues to defy us and the world we will move deliberately yet decisively to hold iraq to account
761552 with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons our own options to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies then the attacks of september 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors
761553 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on that terrible morning 19 evil men the shock troops of a hateful ideology gave america and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions they imagined in the words of one terrorist that september the 11th would be the beginning of the end of america by seeking to turn our cities into killing fields terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nations resolve and force our retreat from the world they have failed
761554 now were in a new and unprecedented war against violent islamic extremists this is an ideological conflict we face against murderers and killers who try to impose their will these are the people that attacked us on september the 11th and killed nearly 3 000 people the stakes are high and once again we have had to change our strategic thinking the major battleground in this war is iraq
761555 we know that iraq and al qaeda have had high level contacts that go back a decade some al qaeda leaders who fled afghanistan went to iraq these include one very senior al qaeda leader who received medical treatment in baghdad this year and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks weve learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases
761556 w e we need to think about saddam hussein using al qaeda to do his dirty work to not leave fingerprints behind
761557 evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of al qaeda secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own
761558 w hat i want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between iraq and the al qaeda terrorist network a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network
761559 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on t he liberation of iraq removed an ally of al qaeda
761560 statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that iraq and al
761561 the intelligence community did not confirm that muhammad atta met an iraqi intelligence officer in prague in 2001 as the vice president repeatedly claimed
761562 a substantial amount of iraqs chemical warfare agents precursors munitions and production equipment were destroyed between 1991 and 1998 as a result of operation desert storm and unscom actions t here is no reliable information on whether iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or whether iraq has or will establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities
761563 t he notion of a saddam hussein with his great oil wealth with his inventory that he already has of biological and chemical weapons is i think a frightening proposition for anybody who thinks about it
761564 in defiance of the united nations iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons and is rebuilding the facilities used to make more of those weapons
761565 all the world has now seen the footage of an iraqi mirage aircraft with a fuel tank modified to spray biological agents over wide areas iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on unmanned aerial vehicles with ranges far beyond what is permitted by the security council a uav launched from a vessel off the american coast could reach hundreds of miles inland
761566 the iraqi report also failed to deal with issues which have arisen since 1998 including attempts to acquire uranium and the means to enrich it
761567 the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
761568 we do know that there have been shipments going into iraq of aluminum tubes that really are only suited to high quality aluminum tools sic that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs centrifuge programs
761569 our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production
761570 h e has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries even after inspections resumed by now just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion there is controversy about what these tubes are for most us experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium
761571 statements by the president and vice president prior to the october 2002 national intelligence estimate regarding iraqs chemical weapons production capability and activities did not reflect the intelligence communitys uncertainties as to whether such production was ongoing
761572 the secretary of defenses statement that the iraqi government operated underground wmd facilities that were not vulnerable to conventional airstrikes because they were underground and deeply buried was not substantiated by available intelligence information
761573 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
761574 states such as these iraq iran and north korea and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world
761575 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction he is amassing them to use against our friends our enemies and against us
761576 the history the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion saddam husseins regime is a grave and gathering danger to suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence to assume this regimes good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble and this is a risk we must not take
761577 n o terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of saddam hussein and iraq
761578 on its present course the iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency it has developed weapons of mass death
761579 but the president also believes that this problem has to be dealt with and if the united nations wont deal with it then the united states with other likeminded nations may have to deal with it we would prefer not to go that route but the danger is so great with respect to saddam hussein having weapons of mass destruction and perhaps even terrorists getting hold of such weapons that it is time for the international community to act and if it doesnt act the president is prepared to act with likeminded nations
761580 today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent threat posed by iraq a dictator who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or possess those weapons we will not permit saddam hussein to blackmail and or terrorize nations which love freedom
761581 but the risk of doing nothing the risk of the security of this country being jeopardized at the hands of a madman with weapons of mass destruction far exceeds the risk of any action we may be forced to take
761582 statements by the president and the vice president indicating that saddam hussein was prepared to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against the united states were contradicted by available intelligence information
761583 authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of 2002
761584 whereas iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations
761585 whereas members of al qaeda an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the united states its citizens and interests including the attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 are known to be in iraq
761586 one question for you both do you believe that there is a link between saddam hussein a direct link and the men who attacked on september the 11th
761587 i could find no evidence of links between iraq and al qaeda the documentation and interviews indicated that al qaeda regarded saddam a secular leader as an infidel
761588 weve been looking at this hard for more than a year and you know what we just dont think its there
761589 nothing in this joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the war powers resolution
761590 dudes there is pre mixed jack and coke in the vending machine
761591 not anymore the nuns bought it all once they found out
761592 to show maximum restraint and refrain from any threat or use of force against each other and to avoid provocative military activities
761593 we have a right to take our land to do anything possible to take back our territories
761594 i dont envisage at this stage any use of military force to do that
761595 based on this evidence its time to ramp up funding from all sources not to slow down or go on to other things were on the path toward victory here lets invest more
761596 a six fold increase in financing for hiv programs in low and middle income countries from 2001 2007 is beginning to bear fruit as gains in lowering the number of aids deaths and preventing new infections are apparent in many countries
761597 progress remains uneven however and the epidemics future is still uncertain underscoring the need for intensified action to move towards universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support
761598 there are still five new infections for every two people who are newly added on treatment so clearly were not pushing back the epidemic enough

761764 we are seeing this incredibly unique cross pollinization of innovation
761765 weve had a lot of hand wringing around fragmentation in the past
761766 how do you create applications for mobile and embedded linux how do you to go to market with linux systems how are they received by the eco system how do isvs actually make money with apps and how do operators roll out new services and deploy apps to support their business models

761809 the figures show that organizations havent nailed down the e mail channel
761810 e mail protection is catching on as a technology that manages information as the industry moves away from protect and defense to becoming more aware how information flows around the organization
761811 these figures do not surprise me on the whole employees are not sending stuff out maliciously but through carelessness or lack of forethought
761812 education can help to some extent but many employees are using communications tools all day every day and mistakes will happen so having checks in place makes sense affordability of available technology to tackle the problem is also a problem as most businesses are unable to invest in the high end on premise data leak prevention dlp products that large business can
761813 it is not that they have not wanted to clamp down on leaks
761814 they have been aware for some time but it is more the fact that there wasnt the technology to do so e mail protection is a consolidation of several technologies
761815 people have been wanting it and now vendors are selling solutions most of which are data leak protection products focused on leaks and not the environment in which leaks occur
761816 there are a lot of integration issues to consider namely integration with encryption policies different classification of data etc
761817 a data leak solution needs to fit into wider risk management solution
761818 they should look at what they are trying to protect how long they need to protect their data for who uses that data etc
761819 the security industry is oriented around keeping customers in a constant state of fear

761861 s lo que las ltimas que est bamos discutiendo salieron el 31 de julio algunas son org nicas otras no una de ellas muy importante la nueva ley de las fuerzas armadas hay que aplicarla la reserva nacional pasa a ser milicia nacional bolivariana el ej rcito ahora pasa a llamarse por ley ej rcito nacional bolivariano aviaci n militar bolivariana marina de guerra bolivariana y guardia nacional bolivariana pero adem s hay un cambio de concepto no solo cambio de nombre es un cambio de esquema en la estructura de la fuerza armada

761866 i love eating at french meadow bakery where else could i get a grilled cheese roasted pepper and dijon mustard sandwich on man bread lets eat here all the time
761867 i didnt even see it until we were right up on it
761868 i had like half a second it was just just enough time to realize what was going to happen
761869 but it blew behind us so we must have done something right
761870 ds you aint eod you have no idea what to do if it is an efp take a picture look for a trigger guy run
761871 the fob rules say you should be at least 100 feet from the tent and in a designated smoking area these tents catch fire real easy
761872 sir there are very few times when i would tell you to go fuck yourself this is one of these times
761873 sir whats the actually velocity of a tank tread as it hits the ground
761874 its the same as the velocity of the wire deploying from a wire guided missile zero the trees will not ruin their day but you will
761875 i dont know where the quarterback friendly came from but he better throw completions
761876 it is our responsibility as coaches to find out what these players do best and put them in situations to their advantage
761877 make sure the team you are playing knows they better bring their lunch because we are going to come after you on every play
761878 sometimes playing quarterback you want a guy to make business decisions and not get caught up emotionally and trying too hard and forcing things
761879 and he john parker wilson seems to have developed a real maturity in that area which i think could affect his play in that area in a positive way
761880 this is a great kid somebody who cares about the state of alabama somebody who really cares about alabama football
761881 and a guy who is doing everything he can to help us win games
761882 i think technically he has improved and i think his decision making and judgment has improved
761883 and hopefully we can continue to make the big plays and minimize the not so good plays that we have especially when it comes to turning the ball over which is still one of the most critical statistics to winning
761884 yeah i know this one here i picked him up for dui two weeks ago hes a belligerent little prick
761885 he didnt stay here this summer and didnt workout but we had several other players that didnt do that but we just felt like these are the guys we needed to invite to camp so we just made a decision to move on

761894 he convocado a esta conferencia de prensa en calidad de presidenta de la comisi n nacional de garant as de mi partido para hacer uso de su conocimiento y el de sus militantes mi posici n sobre lo acontecido hasta la fecha y la decisi n que he tomado al respecto
761895 por todos es conocido que en el proceso electoral interno se cometieron irregularidades graves que afectaron el proceso electoral deslegitim ndolo ante los ojos de los militantes y de la sociedad
761896 de manera personal y con el apoyo de mi equipo analice minuciosamente el caso de estas dos tipos de casillas y llegu a la convicci n jur dica de que lo nico procedente es decretar su anulaci n ya que en todos los casos carece de los documentos que soportan y acreditan la legal instalaci n de las casillas y la debida recepci n del voto de los militantes
761897 por una parte dos comisionados tienden a convalidar la votaci n consignada incluso en actas ap crifas otra que es la que yo represento reitera que del an lisis exhaustivo de la documentaci n referente a cada una de estas casillas se carece de legalidad y por lo tanto procede su anulaci n
761898 que s lo dieron como resultado una apreciaci n rid cula de la actuaci n de la comisi n nacional de garant as pero lo m s grave es que acabaron por hacerla c mplice del fraude
761899 nunca se trat de una confrontaci n de visiones jur dicas ya que no se preocuparon por convencer de sus acuerdos o de vencer las posiciones contrarias por la fuerza de sus argumentos optaron por eludir la responsabilidad evitaron dar la cara al debate optaron por asumir una acci n pol tica de mayor a sin oportunidad para una discusi n
761900 renuncio a la presidencia de la comisi n nacional de garant as del prd porque las resoluciones que est n suscribiendo los comisionados renato sales heredia y dolores de los ngeles nazares validan actas ap crifas as como actas con votaci n at pica con lo que se contabilizan votos que fueron fabricados ilegalmente premiando el fraude e instaurando la impunidad ante estos hechos vergonzosos
761901 renuncio a la comisi n nacional de garant as porque al dar validez a las actas de casillas no instaladas y con votaci n at pica se convalidan las elecciones de los estados de oaxaca veracruz y chiapas contabilizando votos fabricados ilegalmente propiciando entre la militancia de estos estados un clima de confrontaciones interminable no existe en la comisi n una mayor a responsable sino un bando que act a como una fracci n en cuyo proceder priva la parcialidad
761902 no horse had ever gone undefeated won 15 in a row won the hambo it would have been really tough to get beat here i know theyre all going to get beat but i really wanted this one
761903 its nice to accomplish this weve won one hambo its in the history books
761904 i started in buffalo and i was basically starving to death racing a four claimer and not thinking about the hambletonian
761905 when i first came down to new york i saw prakas i was racing at roosevelt and came over to see him win the 1985 hambletonian
761906 i only sold half of dewey because i wanted to be back in the hambo
761907 if you sell all your good ones you cant be back in this is what its all about
761908 i probably would have rather come from behind but after i looked around i thought if im going to get beat i might as well get beat on the front end and then you have no excuses
761909 id seen everyone was in the holes so i figured we could back them off the fractions which were pretty fast really
761910 i had a big hold on him i didnt think i was going that much an opening quarter in 26 4 seconds
761911 i think he crazed had enough clearance but that was my point
761912 youre trying to use other horses as blockers and get more of a break thats the one thing about this place i won 11 races in a row here with dewey this is such a tough track you have to be an unbelievable horse to win so many youre coming down the lane youre trying to save as much horse as you can for the rest of the mile
761913 i think 26 4 was a pretty quick first quarter
761914 he tim tetrick driving crazed never had to use his horse and he still didnt get by his horse raced really well hes a good horse and id love to own him but my horse put him away i think if i was in the two hole i would have blown right by him my horse is actually better out of a hole i was definitely worried in the stretch
761915 i didnt want to get beat falling asleep in the hambletonian i knew crazed has a good brush i was backing into him on the last turn trying to keep him trapped in a little bit about a quarter of a way down the lane i asked dewey to go hes just a tough horse and he when he gets to that point he wants to fight i dont know what the win was by but i knew i won
761916 i used him too early if i had sat in he would have won and i would have been able to pick my post instead of getting the 10 i told dan driver daniel dube to sit in with him hes going to give you one wicked quarter he will pass horses he made up eight in the lane at yonkers to finish second in the yonkers trot hes just a good little horse who races tough every week
761917 in his fifth start here i had to hit him twice
761918 i put him in a bad spot in the final of the new jersey sire stakes he came home from about eighth and in the last 10 feet he had to get up and i gave him a couple of shots and i knew hed respond this was the second time he ever felt the stick
761919 i think he has a shot of beating 1 50 out west in either kentucky or duquoin especially if someone cuts some of the fractions for him because hes definitely better from behind
761920 im not going to dodge any bullets to keep him unbeaten
761921 nbc was out at the farm and for four hours i rode him swam him he jogged and he just stood there
761922 thats just his best quality hes just got such a good disposition
761923 probably up until thursday i must have had 50 calls a day guys want to see dewey and film him
761924 people are very nice but after a while you do get tired of it i said i cant imagine what an nfl quarterback before the super bowl goes through
761925 i made history no horse ever went undefeated won 15 in a row won the hambletonian it would have been really tough to get beat here i know theyre all going to get beat but i really wanted this one
761926 hes got his own apartment he can walk in and out of a half acre paddock any time he wants i might even get up and ride him a bit its a great feeling hes a special horse you ride him and he just enjoys it most sunday mornings i get up at 6 30 or 7 and take him for a ride its fun we put him in a paddock with a pond and he takes a dip here and there

761942 one thing that kenny sansom kept on saying on the live audio was that he thought we need an out and out striker
761943 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16 at that age you can improve he looked strong enough and not phased by the big games the quality is there i dont look too much at his age more at what he is doing on the pitch and right now what he is doing is good
761944 he felt that people had questioned his commitment and the best answer to that is to give your all on the pitch play well show that you are ready to fight for your shirt fight for your team and be efficient he showed that and he is a man of character you know how it is if you score goals people quickly forget the frustration you have to show things with performances in our job
761945 just how long can we keep saying he is too young
761946 just because he made a mistake does not mean that is what he is

761958 het gaat om een uiterst zeldzame en mooi bewaarde klokkenoven die uniek is voor ons land
761959 we hebben extra archeologen ingezet om in deze belangrijke kerk de rijkdom van aldeneik en maaseik bekend te maken
761960 we hebben zeven maanden gespeurd in het verleden van deze kerk pas deze week vonden we de mooiste vondst deze klokkenoven uit de twaalfde eeuw is echt in bijzonder goede staat leem en brons zijn mooi afgetekend in rood en zwarte kleuren in de ondergrond ook de vuurkanalen zijn in goede staat de oven werd aangelegd vlak onder de toren en een klok had 1 500 graden nodig om het brons te gieten de klok werd onder te toren gegoten en manueel naar boven getild het was een zware klok waarmee dus niet gesjouwd werd waar de klok nu is weten we niet in tongeren zijn klokkenovens ontdekt uit de elfde eeuw maar deze zijn niet zo mooi bewaard gebleven als deze in aldeneik
761961 de oven kan onmogelijk opgegraven worden omdat hij zou verpulveren
761962 we zullen nagaan of we een ruimte kunnen maken in de grond waarbij deze vondst zichtbaar blijft van boven uit hoe we dit kunnen realiseren moet nog besproken worden maar we doen ons best

762171 dubai some foreign media have the habit of taking up trivial issues and blowing them up which raises the question of objectivity said a senior official

762177 the u s open was a pretty fun meet because the atmosphere is a lot more relaxed than it was at the olympic trials so i felt less pressure on every swim and could just relax and not worry so much about making mistakes in my races
762178 it was still a fast meet with plenty of people to race so i think it was almost an ideal situation
762179 overall i was happy with how i swam especially with the 400 and the 800 and it was good for me to make finals and to work on swimming fast in the morning and trying to improve at night mostly this meet made me really excited to get back to northwestern in september and start getting ready for big tens and ncaas
762180 hollie im trying to lose weight not gain weight why would i eat fat if i wan to lose fat
762181 creamy sauces buttered vegetables and ice cream taste good for a reason its not that your body is trying to torment you by making unhealthy foods seem delectable instead your body is using your taste buds to signal what you need
762182 starving yourself is counterproductive since it signals the body to hold onto fats when you eat sufficient quantities of the right kinds of fats youll notice that you can for hours without eating and without experiencing food cravings because your body is satisfied and your blood sugar is stable nutritional satisfaction signals your body that food is abundant so it releases fat stores this is the key to weight loss

762210 mr le huy was held in the airport detention facility in dubai and later the al wathba prison where he shared a cell with radio 1 dj grooverider who was convicted to four years in jail for carrying a small amount of cannabis on february 19
762211 a very small percentage of them were guilty of trying to bring something across but by and large they were innocent
762212 most others werent serious criminals but one was a paedophile which was particularly nasty we had a 15 year old and a 17 year old put in the prison as well and they werent kept separate from him we took care of them but one night he kicked down the door of another guys cell it was pretty disturbing
762213 there was a hepatitis and hiv scare at the detention centre
762214 you get tested when you arrive and there were three men found positive but it took the guards to sort out who they were and move them
762215 there was also some drugging one guy came in he was screaming all day and all night and kept everyone up he would just lie in the middle of his urine and faeces they put him in solitary but he got better and said he had been injected by guards
762216 another guy came in with the same thing we fed him food and water through the bars but he didnt improve
762217 the bathrooms were absolutely filthy the toilets were overflowing there was a salmonella outbreak but the prison denied it was happening
762218 mr le huy is now supporting the campaigns to free others he met there and hopes pressure will build on the country to change its legal system

762262 right now we know hes out this week maybe longer well have to wait and see where hes at
762263 right now theyre not here whatever time they miss is valuable time because theyre rookies the good part about it is that there are other guys who are going to have to play when those guys come back theyre going to be asked to play mentally they have to stay into it thats the hard part when youre not practicing and youre missing all of those reps as a player you need those reps but thats not going to stop us from doing what were trying to do you cant do anything about it right now it happens it happens all across the league you cant feel sorry for yourself or your football team

762265 if you watched practice today the players were off the field generally when we practice the players are behind the coaches on the field basically we told them to get everybody off the field and just let em play football and coach em on the boundaries like wed do during a game situation they dont need a coach in the huddle with them telling them what to do they are going to have to do it in a game that way now some guys have to step up and be leaders

762279 the defendant and his friend were walking past the group and they received racist abuse
762280 he was clearly incensed by what had happened and the racist abuse they had received
762281 the defendant was approached by several members of the group
762282 the defendant produced a knife he had with him and stabbed christopher linden a number of times and slashed him across the chin
762283 i carry a knife they attacked me so i stabbed him
762284 why cant i use my knife if i am being assaulted
762285 because of his upbringing surrounded by multiple nationalities and religions he has never suffered racial abuse before
762286 this is the first time he has received racist abuse
762287 he took the knife out in a moment of stupidity
762288 normally as you know the court would be looking at an immediate custodial sentence for offences of this type
762289 but this is a highly unusual case and i can take a different course
762290 muslims destroyed the buddhist monasteries and either executed or drove out the buddhist monks there was no one left to take up the religion from 1192 to the present day buddhism ceased to be an organized religion in india
762291 he is a man of previous good character he fully accepts his behaviour was unacceptable and he is very remorseful
762292 what most worries us about this offence is your attitude to that young girl and how it affected her
762293 for it is written that a son of arabia would awaken a fearsome eagle the wrath of the eagle would be felt throughout the lands of allah and lo while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced for the wrath of the eagle cleansed the lands of allah and there was peace

762298 its true that the materials you in fact had were so inferior so third rate that they would not themselves have made a viable bomb but the fault was with the quality of materials and not in the concept
762299 if you had developed this concept into a working bomb there would have been great potential for destruction injury and death
762300 there was an attack from outside the asylum centre by people who dont live here chechens 40 to 50 men armed with steel bars and other weapons

762318 nature has endowed the great white shark with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
762319 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle

762323 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
762324 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
762325 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field

762328 keith got out to ask whats going on when this man jumped out of the car and hit him with a knife
762329 its hard to take in really you go down to do a peaceful bit of shopping and this sort of thing happens it was over something trivial

762349 not all affected people will meet the official definition of unemployed many will simply exit the labour force
762350 the other 96 are living through the highest inflation in two decades and they will demand compensation

762372 it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in
762373 according to morris this verse describes a spherical earth the hebrew word is hwg i believe that this refers to the circular horizon that vaults itself over the earth to form a dome

762410 because the authorities fear it could spark race riots council bosses in bradford west yorks have ditched the event over concerns it could upset the asian community many of them muslim
762411 the announcement was met with anger and disbelief and in a bid to pour oil over troubled waters an alternate date of july 1 was proposed now this second choice has also been pulled
762412 they told us they were going to hold it on july 1 instead but they have cancelled that
762413 i thought they would cancel it they just held it out as an olive branch to try and shut us up the reality is the support for the event had gone because the sponsors lost interest
762414 now anyone who reads theopinionator or any of the many other
762415 two schoolboys were given detention after refusing to kneel down and pray to allah during a religious education lesson parents were outraged that the two boys from year seven 11 to 12 year olds were punished for not wanting to take part in the practical demonstration of how allah is worshipped they said forcing their children to take part in the exercise at alsager high school near stoke on trent which included wearing muslim headgear was a breach of their human rights
762416 but if muslims were asked to go to church on sunday and take holy communion there would be war
762417 i understand that they have to learn about other religions i can live with that but it is taking it a step too far to be punished because they wouldnt join in muslim prayer
762418 making them pray to allah who isnt who they worship is wrong and what got me is that they were told they were being disrespectful
762419 i dont want this to look as if i have a problem with the school because i am generally very happy with it
762420 i am absolutely furious my daughter was made to take part in it and i dont find it acceptable
762421 i havent got a problem with them teaching my child other religions and a small amount of information doesnt do any harm
762422 but not only did they have to pray the teacher had gone into the class and made them watch a short film and then said we are now going out to pray to allah
762423 then two boys got detention and all the other children missed their refreshment break because of the teacher
762424 not only was it forced upon them my daughter was told off for not doing it right
762425 theyd never done it before and they were supposed to do it in another language
762426 my child has been forced to pray to allah in a school lesson
762427 its absolutely disgusting theres no other way of putting it
762428 my daughter and a lot of other mothers are furious about their children being made to kneel on the floor and pray to islam if they didnt do it they were given detention
762429 i am not racist ive been friendly with an indian for 30 years ive also been to a muslim wedding where it was explained to me that alcohol would not be served and i respected that
762430 but if muslims were asked to go to church on sunday and take holy communion there would be war
762431 its difficult to know at the moment whether this was part of the curriculum or not i am not an re teacher i am an english teacher
762432 at the moment it is our enterprise week and many of our members of staff are away
762433 the particular member of staff you need to speak to isnt around i think that it is a shame that so many parents have got in touch with the press before coming to me
762434 i have spoken to the teacher and she has articulately given me her version of events but that is all i can give you at the moment
762435 the headteacher david black contacted this authority immediately complaints were received
762436 enquiries are being made into the circumstances as a matter of urgency and all parents will be informed accordingly
762437 educating children in the beliefs of different faith is part of the diversity curriculum on the basis that knowledge is essential to understanding
762438 fight those who believe not allah nor the last day
762439 take neither the jews nor the christians for your friends
762440 the unbelievers are the worst beasts in the eyes of allah
762441 as far as i am concerned everyone should be treated equally in the face of the law and we cannot have people of different religious groups laying the law down i hope the police will go about their business as they would do normally
762442 will the government participate sooner than the general populace or later
762443 doctors and job centre workers are breaching confidentiality rules and passing on vital information to families allowing them to trace and punish asian women who are attempting to escape coerced marriages and
762444 shahien taj director of the cardiff based womens group the henna foundation said
762445 we have to be careful with the police especially the asian ones we dont visit the station where certain asian officers are on because some of them are perpetrators and one of them on the record said he would not arrest someone who used force on his wife
762446 gps will tell fathers their daughter has seen them and is on the pill that can get a girl killed public sector employees will pass on to a family member an individuals national insurance number knowing it can be used to trace their new whereabouts around the country
762447 there is collusion by certain public servants and people in a position of authority such as doctors which supports these offences it means many victims dont have the faith or the trust to be able to report their situation
762448 recently i had a case in birmingham of a woman who said she cant trust the police because nine times she had run away and nine times the police returned her to her family where she got abused fortunately acpo are now addressing this kind of problem openly and trying to do something about it
762449 we have to be careful with the police especially the asian ones we dont visit the station where certain asian officers are on because some of them are perpetrators and one of them on the record said he would not arrest someone who used force on his wife
762450 i would never have believed that a mother could hold down her pregnant daughter while her brother strangled her because she was carrying the child of a man she should not have been seeing
762451 we have too many areas where people dont believe this is an issue for them but we are seeing situations across the country where victims who are at extreme risk are being moved to another part of the country away from their home towns by their families
762452 a house a horse and a woman are evil omen a mat in a house is better than a barren women
762453 a black dog is satan a black dog or a donkey or a woman cancels a prayer
762454 beat your wives if they commit sinful acts women are captives of their husbands
762455 a woman is a property a righteous woman is the best property
762456 also pick and choose on the dog issue predominately muslim egypt uses police sniffer dogs at their cairo airport presumably without booties recently one of these dogs sniffed out snakes and reptiles being illegally smuggled out of the country by guess who
762457 we are trying to ensure that police forces are aware of sensitivities that people can have with the dogs to make sure they are not going against any religious or cultural element within peoples homes it is being addressed and forces are working towards doing it
762458 in islamic law the dog is not regarded as impure only its saliva is most islamic schools of law agree on that if security measures require to send a dog into a house then it has to be done i think acpo needs to consult better and more widely
762459 i know in the muslim community there is a hang up against dogs but this is cultural also we know the british like dogs we muslims should do our bit to change our attitudes
762460 the police are in effect being overly sensitive to potential criminals and not being sensitive enough to the public at large who need to be protected these sort of things have a counter productive effect because they cause huge friction between different communities
762461 either a dog an ass a pig a jew a magian and a woman cuts off a prayer
762462 women slaves and camels are the same you must seek allahs refuge from all these
762463 a black dog is satan a black dog or a donkey or a woman cancels a prayer
762464 an ass a woman and a black dog annuls a prayer

762473 in a world of talkers mack is a thinker and doer he doesnt say much unless you ask him directly which most folks have learned not to do when he does speak you wonder if he isnt some sort of alien who sees the landscape of human ideas and experiences differently than everybody else the thing is he usually makes uncomfortable sense in a world where most folks would rather just hear what they are used to hearing which is often not much of anything those who know him generally like him well enough providing he keeps his thoughts mostly to himself and when he does talk it isnt that they stop liking him rather they are not quite so satisfied with themselves mack once told me that he used to speak his mind more freely in his younger years but he admitted that most of such talk was a survival mechanism to cover his hurts he often ended up spewing his pain on everyone around him he says that he had a way of pointing out peoples faults and humiliating them while maintaining his own sense of false power and control not too endearing

762498 so we have rising crime and a perception that the police do not police the streets any more people feel like the police are locked in their offices and not out engaging with their diverse and empowered communities what can we do
762499 i know well pull any old bunch of twats off the street put them in a uniform that looks like a policeman but not actually waste any time training them as coppers plus since they wont actually have any power we dont need to be fussy about the people we get for the job
762500 but wont the public eventually rumble this as a con
762501 the incumbent government can use the taxpayers money to fund propaganda to sell their message to the electorate
762502 it allows the government to have more air time and get its message across to people
762503 the angels showed tonight why they have the best record in baseball liz ball strike ratio was not what it needs to be he was pitching behind a lot leadoff walks and two out walks have a way of catching up to you in a hurry
762504 for a long time our pitching has been driving this whole machine and in the last two games we havent been as crisp on the mound but offensively we picked them up so thats a good sign
762505 ive had an opportunity to think about it well see what happens i dont know what my options are at this time well see right now hes scheduled to pitch on wednesday if that changes ill let you know
762506 it comes with the territory every year its a part of the game and guys have to deal with it as best as they can thats more in andys area you can let yourself get carried away with it if you allow your mind to wander focus on what you have to do and dont worry about things you cant control
762507 you have to consider every possibility just from the standpoint of doing something to keep the morale of your team from going bonkers
762508 the last thing in the world im going to do is accept it and the last thing i want the players to do is accept it i hope people are upset about it i wish someone would light a fire under somebody and say enough is enough sometimes you have to do something to give yourself a shot in the arm its not okay what we will do about is stay tuned if it aint working we have to do something we dont have anything to lose by trying something different im not saying thats going to happen tomorrow or next week but i think it has to be considered
762509 we blew ourselves out of the water we didnt play well and its a direct reflection of what the era of the starting pitchers is and thats telling like it is we want to play better we need to pitch better

762522 the amount of data we have access to keeps growing by leaps and bounds every year and the bigger it gets the harder it is to sift through
762523 dashboards allow us to present data in visual fashion that makes it more intuitive and useful so our people can find what interests them then drill down into the data to find out more
762524 we help companies understand what metrics to look at what data they need to collect and how to make it visual
762525 with our dashboards you never see more than three of four things at once because the average person cant assimilate more data than that at one time
762526 people can always take it further by clicking on the icons in some cases going 25 to 50 layers of information deep
762527 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
762528 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

762545 im not interested in thinking as hard about this as you are
762546 i find on balance it is more likely that the wife has fabricated the sexual abuse allegations
762547 i wish id had more time to resolve things with her
762548 well id have to see evidence these kinds of shows are fun but they arent exactly scientific
762549 some facts that youd have no way of knowing some kind of controlled trial that could be confirmed by multiple observers with no interest in the outcome
762550 what if i put myself in a closed room and my wife in another room and we both came up with facts about the deceased time of death place of death what the weather was like cause of death
762551 sounds interesting but i wouldnt take your word for it id have to have independent corroboration maybe you could convince james randi
762552 he doesnt even have the money hes offering the its just bonds and paper
762553 i think he but thats kind of beside the point no one has ever claimed it but ok it wouldnt have to be james randi any skeptic or credible scientist would do
762554 im so sorry youve been ruined by your mother shes turned you into a jaded materialist
762555 this has nothing to do with her frankly i think youre fucking victimizing vulnerable people by claiming to speak to their dead relatives pardon my french
762556 they might very well believe you but that still doesnt make it real
762557 sean you need to open your mind you just dont understand
762558 i understand perfectly what you are doing youre entertainers why dont you let it go at that
762559 were a lot more than entertainers we work on the level of the spirit
762560 you have no proof of that no ones ever provided any convincing proof of the spirit world i know all about how is done and mediums have been making these claims for centuries its the oldest bag of tricks there is your drawings are undoubtedly vague enough that people latch on to them and thats an easy sell when people are so desperate to talk to their loved ones
762561 no for the second time when your brain ceases to function your personality disappears forever there is no afterlife
762562 im afraid thats exactly what you are and dont sell it short youre brains a pretty amazing thing of course its not perfect its got you convinced youre talking to dead people

762567 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

762600 we should start considering our sojourn to earth as a loan
762601 technological measures and regulations may be important but equally important is support for education ecological training and ethics a consciousness of the commonality of all living beings and an emphasis on shared responsibility
762602 whether global climate changes occur in natural cycles or not to what degree we humans contribute to them what threats stem from them and what can be done to prevent them
762603 return again and again to the roots of human existence and consider our prospects in centuries to come we must analyze everything open mindedly soberly unideologically and unobsessively and project our knowledge into practical policies
762604 is it necessary to know that to the last percentage point though
762605 maybe it is no longer a matter of simply promoting energy saving technologies but chiefly of introducing ecologically clean technologies of diversifying resources and of not relying on just one invention as a panacea
762606 n ature is issuing warnings that we must not only stop the debt from growing but start to pay it back

762609 the co2 record lags the temperature increase by another 300 years

762611 i ndividuals and groups support government regulation of energy use either because they are concerned about the negative effects of oil gas and other fossil fuels on the environment or about the impact of demand for these fuels on national security
762612 m any ways to make the supply of energy sources more reliable in order to promote national security conflict with the goal of reducing pollution from the use of energy in the economy
762613 p olicies that meet both these concerns are feasible and clearly would have greater political support than the many approaches that advance one of these goals at the expense of the other
762614 p rospects for political consensus on energy policies are dim for the many approaches that further one of these causes at the expense of the other
762615 many ways to make the supply of energy sources more reliable in order to promote national security conflict with the goal of reducing pollution from the use of energy in the economy
762616 f ortunately various governmental policies contribute to both environmental and national security goals
762617 p olicies that meet both these concerns about the environment and national security are feasible and clearly would have greater political support than the many approaches that advance one of these goals at the expense of the other

762633 i want to give her the opportunity to do what she wants to do if its good for her if its wrestling so be it
762634 a lot of coaches think having girls in our sport hurts our sport but i couldnt disagree more
762635 how can a sport like wrestling that fights for media attention that fights for sponsorship that fights for attendance that fights for everything how can inviting another half of the population into our sport hurt it
762636 instead of us being a program that had to add womens wrestling down the road why dont we be one that is a trendsetter and forerunner and let everybody else try to catch up to us

762670 among obese adults long term weight loss and prevention of weight regain have been less than desired
762671 this clarifies the amount of physical activity that should be targeted for achieving and sustaining this magnitude of weight loss but also demonstrates the difficulty of sustaining this level of physical activity
762672 research is needed to improve long term compliance with this targeted level of physical activity moreover continued contact with the intervention staff and the ability to sustain recommended eating behaviors also may be important contributing factors to maintaining a significant weight loss that exceeds 10 percent of initial body weight which suggests that physical activity does not function independently of these other behaviors

762707 this new online resource is an excellent way for people to find out more about nhs pregnancy and birth services and to see what local maternity services can offer them
762708 all you need to do is type in your postcode and choose which units to compare and you can make up your mind on what services you would like to discuss using with your midwife based on the best and most up to date information and data
762709 the lack of a comprehensive nhs online maternity guide has become marked in recent years just at the time that people are demanding more and more online information we havent had a reliable place to direct people to
762710 i will definitely use this planner as back up to care and will print out the key sections for expectant parents without internet access
762711 i think that a product such as this is vital especially for first time mothers like myself who dont really know what to expect this product guides you through step by step giving safe reliable information which is important as other than your doctor and midwife these days people expect to be able to look up everything they need to know on the internet

762719 obviously gma is not empowered to give up any part of our country to any group only the filipino people can do that in their sovereign capacity and only via amending the constitution
762720 gma being a highly unpopular president does not have the social capital to convince filipinos to cede their territory even for something as laudable as peace in mindanao so when the inevitable occurs and the government fails to deliver its promise to the milf the rebels will have a clear casus belli or a justification for acts of war

762757 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
762758 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

762761 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
762762 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
762763 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
762764 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
762765 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
762766 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
762767 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
762768 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

762781 i would have voted for a ron paul kucinich ticket without hesitation regardless of which of them led the slate

762797 it will be painstaking slow and very meticulous we will be starting from scratch
762798 we will take the investigation apart and put it back together we will take statements apart word for word look at witness statements and those interviewed there have to be people with information there are people with information we will try and squeeze them
762799 i dont think that prices will return to the record level nor will they fall below 100 per barrel
762800 geopolitical and supply issues are beginning to return to the forefront of traders minds
762801 further supply strains came with the news that the large bp refining plant in texas was to shutdown in the face of technical issues
762802 but the decline does not necessarily mean a return to oil at prices between 85 and 100 per barrel in the near term as the bears would have it
762803 sends an ominous signal to would be bears that maybe the projections of 80 100 are not quite ready to be met just yet
762804 with irish inflation running consistently ahead of our european colleagues for years it was always going to be difficult to secure a moderate pay deal
762805 the absence of any anti inflationary strategy by the government only exacerbated this problem what we are witnessing now is the unravelling of another key element of economic policy on foot of several years of soft option politics from brian cowen as minister for finance
762806 it remains to be seen what can be retrieved in the immediate future from this process

762810 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially by women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings

762815 that was at 12 33pm i know because just a minute before id made a call from my mobile to check how much credit i had left
762816 i know i have done wrong in the past and if i could go back in time and change that i would
762817 ive missed out on so much i should have been getting on with my life who knows what i could have done and achieved
762818 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps i wont follow women anymore i know its wrong

762855 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
762856 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
762857 the climb in oil and other raw material prices over recent months has driven costs up significantly although firms are having some success in passing these costs on profit margins are under pressure
762858 exports are helping to limit the slowdown in the manufacturing sector boosted particularly by sterlings weakness against the euro however the near term outlook for manufacturing still looks tough as the economy enters a precarious phase
762859 say what you like about the prime minister he at least managed to get the brazilians to accept a nama coefficient that will result in brussels accepting an 80 cut in europes most trade distorting farm subsidies
762860 it is obvious that a failure to address such concerns will reduce the opportunities for governments to pursue policies that permit societies to benefit from globalisation
762861 sake already has a very rich and full flavour and aroma so its best drunk with very simple food you dont need anything too robust
762862 personally i like drinking sake with italian antipasto or other mediterranean food
762863 people ask if we alter the flavour of our sake to suit the american palate we do not we are just selling them sake that we believe is the best around
762864 whereas europe is traditionally wine country the us is not traditionally anything
762865 americans like their wine but its less established so the country is more open to new trends europeans taste sake and say yes its good and clearly a quality product but the next drink they have is wine
762866 but this too is slowly changing there is more potential in the uk and europe as europeans surely have a more refined palate than north americans
762867 young people who come here to drink my sake say they didnt realise it could be so good they thought it was an old mans drink
762868 the japanese are very concerned about what foreigners think of their country so if we have more success in the us market then japanese consumers may give it another try
762869 sake is finally coming into its own as a connoisseur beverage overseas so i do not think the novelty will wear off
762870 with uncertain economic times ahead londons tourism industry could be facing its toughest conditions for some years
762871 the department for culture media and sport agreement that governs the help scheme urgently has to be reviewed
762872 the help scheme should not open the floodgates for marketing practices and advertising of additional products or services to older and disabled consumers which can leave them stressed and confused
762873 it is inappropriate for the scheme to select as standard such a confusing commercial deal when it is geared to encourage vulnerable customers to opt for a potentially confusing or costly installation
762874 the dshs must never act as a trojan horse for pay tv services to be promoted to vulnerable groups
762875 we have made sure that what people get for their 40 is clearly set out in the options pack as well as what is extra and what is taken away after two months and that they are under no obligation to subscribe
762876 we are concerned that the sky deal does not meet the usability requirements that had been agreed with government and that were applied rigorously to other products
762877 we understand that sky are being allowed to offset product energy inefficiencies by providing energy efficient light bulbs to customers this makes a mockery of the governments own policy on the energy efficiency of electronic devices
762878 we call on the government to stop and think again the whole aim of this programme is to ease the transition for vulnerable groups not to make it more complex or costly
762879 sky is committed to making the help scheme a success in the border region

762888 my appreciation of the numbers was quite hopeless given my age and my level of experience in the city i wouldnt have thought that i would be so out of touch with reality
762889 it sounds an awful thing to say but i know people i went to school with and ive no idea how they survive on the incomes they have
762890 the goose that lays the golden egg is the people who come to london to make wealth
762891 a reflection of the success of policies here making the city one of the pre eminent financial centres of the world
762892 i dont think we should sit here and say london should be guilty for being successful
762893 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
762894 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
762895 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
762896 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
762897 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do
762898 i do enjoy the fact i can have nice holidays and dont think twice about buying particular items
762899 im sick of this because with 100 000 in manchester you are well off 100 000 is a not a wealthy person down here
762900 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
762901 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
762902 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all
762903 all kinds of bullshit crap which doesnt help the people
762904 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
762905 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
762906 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
762907 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
762908 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
762909 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
762910 lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job
762911 nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that theyre required to do
762912 labour did a bit of that with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions the big debate is about how effectively all that money raising has been applied most people would say not all of it was well applied
762913 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
762914 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
762915 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
762916 say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending
762917 i want to talk about what charity can do for us
762918 what do you do now youve got all the toys
762919 youve already got all the houses yachts cars and jets you can use so what comes next is charity
762920 i get invited to places id never have seen otherwise
762921 if we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity we have a shot at having a really strong impact to be able to transform the lives of children

763000 je ne suis pas s re de bien comprendre cest chez vous software
763001 oui cest bien le probl me leurs fichus r sultats mangent mes b n fices sur le reste tu comprends
763002 pas encore jai lu votre parcours sur internet vous dirigez swen games depuis que le fondateur de swen corp ron swen la s par e pour la coter en bourse en vous pla ant sa t te cest bien a
763003 oui c tait en 2002 je lavais bien aid le vieux je visais sa place il la donn e mon rival charles mais il a t chic avec moi
763004 et games software cest le r sultat de la fusion de vos activit s de logiciels avec le rachat de votre concurrent indien tata software
763005 ecoute je ne vois pas o tu veux en venir tu ne vas pas me faire la le on jen ai plein ce placard des rapports daudit et des meilleurs mckinsey csc peat marwick horemis
763006 tout ce que je constate cest que ce nest pas un probl me
763007 ben oui games software cest le r sultat de vos choix depuis cinq ans personne ne vous a forc r aliser autre chose que vos d sirs l dedans ca mange comme vous dites vos b n fices dailleurs pas vraiment vous mais ce nest pas un probl me
763008 un probl me pour moi cest un cart inexpliqu entre deux situations bien r elles par exemple vous descendez au parking vous montez dans votre audi ce propos vous avez vu la nouvelle r8 a conviendrait pas mieux votre standing
763009 donc vous montez dans votre a8 vous appuyez sur le bouton rouge du d marreur rien ne se passe
763010 oui jai peut tre laiss la clef sans contact dans une autre veste a marrive
763011 non non pour que ce soit un probl me il faut que laudi d c t dans la m me situation la cl dans lhabitacle le r servoir rempli de la m me fa on la batterie tout aussi charg e d marre au quart de tour et la v tre rien
763012 tu veux dire que le probl me cest de trouver la diff rence entre les deux audi qui fait que lune d marre lautre pas alors quelles paraissent quivalentes
763013 oui cest a un probl me nest pas un simple cart entre vos souhaits et la r alit cest un cart entre deux r alit s si vous pr f rez cest quand vous n gligez un aspect de la r alit et que cela carte le cours des v nements dune autre r alit que vous auriez pr f r e
763014 ah mais ma filiale games software elle fait des d ficits dans un m tier o dautres font du b n fice cest a mon probl me
763015 tout ce que je vois moi cest que games software fait comme vous vous tes arrang depuis cinq ans pour quelle fasse nimporte quelle autre entreprise plac e sous le m me leadership depuis cinq ans et les professionnels de tata n taient pas des perdreaux de lann e ferait aujourdhui les m mes pertes donc votre audi d marre pas mais apr s les transformations que vous avez r alis es dessus nimporte quelle audi refuserait aussi de d marrer cest pas un probl me
763016 cest peut tre votre fa on de vous distinguer du grand ron swen ou votre incapacit que vous ne voulez pas admettre r ussir dans ce nouveau m tier dans tous les cas cest un cart entre la r alit et certains de vos d sirs et sans doute pas tous vos d sirs software est le produit de vos efforts ca nengage que vous et si vous ne savez pas comment r sorber cette faille entre vous et vous les meilleurs consultants du monde ny pourront rien

763032 ah ne dramatise pas veux tu patrick je nai pas eu le choix pour m riter ma confiance il faut obtenir les r sultats que je veux
763033 je vois et le jour o les r sultats ne sont plus l la confiance sen va l o vous me bluffez cest comment vous faites pour obtenir des r sultats sans liens de confiance
763034 attends sophie tu ne mauras pas comme a un peu de r sultats un peu de confiance et hop apr s a davantage de r sultats davantage de confiance tu vois
763035 je vois surtout que votre confiance cest comme ma tirelire si je travaille bien mes parents me donnent un peu dargent a se remplit si je travaille mal a se vide parce que moi jai des frais cest fou ce que tout est cher de nos jours
763036 ca oui tu las dit sophie tiens par exemple lautre jour je voulais racheter un petit concurrent tough plug jai mis 100 millions sur la table et bien pour 100 millions de nos jours tu nas plus rien sophie plus rien
763037 ceci dit si vous avez un million en trop vous g nez pas moi jai deux ou trois id es
763038 pour a fais moi confiance je men occupe moi des millions en trop apr s ce que je laisse aux imp ts il ny a jamais rien de trop mais revenons nos moutons quelque chose te chiffonne
763039 oui quelque chose me fait peur dans ce que vous mexpliquez mais cest sans doute que moi je ne suis pas un grand patron
763040 tu en as trop dit ou pas assez sophie accouche
763041 je veux bien essayer mais prenez dabord un chocolat a fera passer
763042 toi cest diff rent je taime bien enfin jaime la fa on dont tu me prends par surprise avec tes remarques de gamine cest vrai que je commence te faire confiance

763044 ah mais non ce serait pas humain a je taime bien mais cest toi que jappr cie si demain tu me fais perdre comme tu dis mon temps je te le dirai on trouvera bien une solution pour continuer tous les deux
763045 vous dites que vous maimez bien mais que vous savez de moi en vrai de vrai
763046 bon daccord sophie un point pour toi je taime bien je te fais confiance mais a se base sur ce que jimagine de toi et qui me plait bien cest peut tre une histoire que je me raconte dailleurs je ne cherche pas trop en savoir je pr f re ce que jai imagin tant pis si ta r alit est diff rente
763047 des r alit s vous savez il y en a autant que de regards votre regard sur moi est positif cest r ciproque a nous permet de travailler ensemble mieux que chacun de son c t voil tout
763048 ce que tu me dis sophie cest que cest mon regard bienveillant sur toi fond sur pas grand chose et surtout sur mon histoire moi qui cr e cette confiance entre nous qui nous permet dobtenir des r sultats
763049 oui face moi vous avez suffisamment confiance en vous pour me faire confiance et cela nous apporte des r sultats que ni vous ni moi navions pr vu dobtenir ensemble
763050 regardez les choses en face patrick vous ne lui avez jamais fait vraiment confiance pas plus qu vos autres soi disant collaborateurs porte cl s jusqu pr sent a ne vous a jamais manqu vous obtenez vos fameux r sultats sans prendre un tel risque
763051 tu y vas fort sophie mais si tu veux dire que je nai jamais eu avec patrick ou ses semblables un lien tr s fort oui tu sais moi je pr f re ne pas m langer les sentiments et les affaires
763052 tu veux dire que mon intelligence a ne suffit pas cr er un lien tr s fort entre moi et lautre cest a
763053 ca peut suffire tant que tout est facile mais si a se g te je crois que cest ce que vous et lautre ressentez tout au fond de vous qui va vous permettre davancer ensemble et que faites vous de votre face cach e
763054 faites pas le na f je veux dire que comme tout le monde vous avez des c t s de vous que vous naimez pas voir en face et que vous aimez donc encore moins voir chez lautre cest a qui vous fait peur dans la possibilit de travailler plus en confiance avec vos collaborateurs
763055 el mentaire vous tes de chair et dos vous tes pour une part cupide comme tout le monde plus vous pr tendez le contraire plus a se voit jai appris a pendant les r cr ations si vous ne regardez pas en face votre propre cupidit et votre fa on de composer avec comment voulez vous g rer celles plus ou moins grandes de chacun de vos collaborateurs
763056 si je comprends bien dapr s toi cest avec des relations plus fortes et plus intimes que je pourrais obtenir plus de r sultats la t te de swen games alors quaujourdhui je fais linverse je reste bonne distance de chacun et si a va mal je coupe et je remplace
763057 vous tes en train de saisir que faire confiance lautre quon connait si peu cest dabord se faire confiance soi m me
763058 le gros inconv nient dans ton histoire cest que si je nobtiens pas les r sultats en tablissant de tels liens avec mes hommes a va me faire souffrir un maximum

763114 the possibility of being held liable for injuries their products cause creates an invaluable incentive for manufacturers to make their products as safe as they can to revise labels as soon as they become aware that they are inadequate and to remove unsafe products from the market
763115 by eliminating this possibility the supreme court decision removed a significant layer of consumer protection which makes passage of the medical device safety act of 2008 so essential

763122 osteonecrosis of the jaw continues to be reported as a suspected adverse drug reaction associated with bisphosphonates and the number of reports appear to be increasing particularly for the most potent bisphosphonates
763123 the weight of evidence from randomised control trials and large observational studies with appropriate control groups does not support an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw in persons treated with bisphosphonates for osteoporosis this implies that there is either no increased risk or if there is it is likely very small
763124 as with everything we do risk should be put in perspective the risk of developing the condition would seem to be much less than the lifetime risk of dying on a plane 1 5 000
763125 topiramate in pregnancy preliminary experience from the uk epilepsy and pregnancy register
763126 more research needs to be done to confirm these results especially since it was a small study

763139 its bit like learning how to turn lead into gold
763140 the fact that the introduction of a small number of proteins into adult human cells could produce cells that are equivalent to embryo stem cells takes us into an entirely new era of stem cell biology
763141 its bit like learning how to turn lead into gold
763142 this new research is just the beginning we hardly understand how these cells work
763143 it is not the time to abandon stem cell research
763144 when we started this we thought it was a high risk project
763145 when we had monkeys doing it i was pretty shocked
763146 were exposing the basic elements the fundamental biology of higher cognition
763147 a discussion on personal finance is found in pages 45 62

763153 short term there will be a perception that this may also have a negative impact on ipod sales as consumers can now play emis itunes downloads on any digital music player it is important to note that non ipod mp3 players will not sync with itunes the same way ipods do our belief is the success of the ipod is not because consumers are locked on the itunes platform but its success has been because of the total device and itunes experience
763154 well if i buy the music its only 10 and this way i will get high quality wav files besides its not like luna were getting rich off of their careers they could use the money
763155 these files were not copied or pirated i actually purchased them
763156 you didnt actually purchase the files you really purchased a license to listen to the music and the license is very specific about how they can be played or listened to
763157 well they were supposed to but we werent able to enforce those licenses back then and now we can
763158 basically just keep downloading the music until you find a gateway that lets your licenses through without problems
763159 drinking coke with fast food is no problem but we must warn you that your license forbids the mixing of coke with any alcoholic beverages
763160 and lo the gifts were inside 600 square cubits of paper and the paper was festooned with pictures of frosty the snowman and joseph was going to throweth it away but mary saideth unto him she saideth holdeth it that is nice paper saveth it for next year and joseph did rolleth his eyeballs and the baby jesus was more interested in the paper than the frankincense
763161 if its such a poor gift that i dont want to be there when the person opens it
763162 no one ever had to wonder which presents daddy wrapped at christmas
763163 the potential savings of this are astronomical compared to the high cost of owning storing and using the helicopters that we now use
763164 not only that helicopters are often unavailable altogether or too slow to the scene to be helpful
763165 what concerns us is that privacy is fundamentally a right to be let alone and go about your business and daily life without having the government looking over your shoulders
763166 it is as disturbing if they are looking over your shoulder with a drone flying overhead as much as over your shoulder literally
763167 while there may be a potential threat to privacy with the new drone if the device is used for the reasons the sheriffs have stated i dont think there is a need for any attempts to ban its use
763168 this is intended for search and rescue quick deployment during a fast moving fire or even a post katrina search operation
763169 we are not going to be looking in back windows and invading privacy we are going to be trying to save lives
763170 the fact that a stranger can pull money out of a persons bank account using only the numbers at the bottom of his or her check is not commonly understood
763171 complaints about unauthorized bank debits are believed to be grossly underreported perhaps because of the lack of public awareness of this type of bank account vulnerability
763172 im stuck in traffic on i 70 but parked at home using company truck for side work
763173 if we exercise this right time warner will have the right to purchase our interests for cash or shares of time warner stock based on an appraised fair market value of our equity interest in holdco in lieu of conducting an initial public offering
763174 biased results no way providing great search is the core of what we do business partnerships will never compromise the integrity or objectivity of our search results if a partners page ranks high its because they have a good answer to your search not because of their business relationship with us
763175 if they were going to move or go out of business they should have at least said hey by the way someone else will pick up your trash or you should make other arrangements
763176 this time we called up the number and it just said the voice box is full so there is no way of getting a hold of them
763177 im let down im considerably let down by this company
763178 we put a notice on their door today asking for a demand for non payment of rent
763179 its hot its going to start smelling real good real soon
763180 the trucks were taken from the company thats what put us out of business
763181 we had no time to contact our customers we were running the business as usual until thursday we had no equipment as of thursday night to continue doing business
763182 we didnt just close doors and not try to do something about it we tried we went above and beyond for months to keep the company running hours and hours and hours of picking up trash to make people satisfied
763183 its been very very sad i wish i could go and magically fix it but i cant
763184 a lot of times its more information than the parents want their teens to be sharing
763185 kids are going out and downloading free games and theyre going to web sites where you can get free serial numbers and download copies of games and install them for free
763186 the problem we find is as soon as you go to one of these crack web sites if you click on anything they are loading spyware and viruses and evil software on your computer
763187 people are just beginning to realize how much power they have
763188 at a time when we are craving community and meaning in our lives people are using these technologies to find others with the same complaints and organize them
763189 they dont have to just sit in a coffee shop and gripe about politics they can change politics
763190 i was upset with kerrys loss but what really devastated me was the loss of that sense of empowerment in my life this sense of engagement that i got with moveon
763191 this wasnt about a huge agenda this was people gathering together and working with each other on things that interested them
763192 it was just a way for people to connect with each other
763193 ten years ago somebody like mary would be as interested as she is in politics but her circle of influence would not have extended beyond her home or block or even voting precinct
763194 now shes got 1 500 other self motivated and influential people at her fingertips and carries as much clout as half the people ive been calling
763195 i was mad at people for not doing anything i was mad at the system and i was mad at james west
763196 people really get a certain high about connecting with other human beings
763197 because we live in such an isolated culture when people come together with other like minded people there is a sense of lets organize to do something
763198 it took a community of people to get me going
763199 im not an activist at heart im a gym rat
763200 but the internet makes it easy to combine an interest in people with an interest in politics
763201 shift the balance of power from established interests that can raise of lot of money and lobby special interests to a bunch of bubble up bottom up citizen campaigns
763202 its great because it reconnects people to government its created a sense of community and a sense of belonging
763203 over 100 000 people came out to support taste of soul
763204 this was the largest gathering of african americans in the history of los angeles
763205 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
763206 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call

763224 this years convention exceed my expectations considering the high fuel process and a struggling economy
763225 but the number of people attending looks to be on a par with last year and we had more aircraft showplanes visiting aircraft
763226 yes its been a tough year economically for aviation but this event is the shot in the arm aviation needed exhibitors report brisk sales the programs offered were the deepest and broadest ever and when asked what day would be the best to attend the answer was every day
763227 this year people stayed on the grounds at night crowds at theater in the woods ranged from 4 000 to 10 00 people every night in the fly in theater there were five or six thousand people a total of 1 200 activities throughout the week airventure 24 7
763228 our intent is to raise 150 000 pounds of fresh produce on the farm annually and make it available first and foremost locally in the mad river valley and washington county and then also to other food shelves and pantries around the state
763229 its a way for us to sustain a sustainable source of fresh produce for the people we serve often times its the fresh produce that doesnt make its way into the shopping cart of needy vermonters because its unaffordable so they lose access and they lose the nutrient value of produce in their diet
763230 it was getting dark i had just seen him it was like 10 minutes and i asked where he was

763270 vi kan ikke fortsat have en situation hvor regeringen laver indenrigspolitik med dansk folkeparti og sikrer sin eu politik med opbakning fra venstrefl jen den nyligt afsagte dom viser at en s dan opdeling ikke l ngere er mulig derfor skal dansk folkeparti have indflydelse p danmarks linje over for eu
763271 ja siden har forn gtet ef domstolens rolle i revis domstolen har siden tresserne haft til opgave at f re en aktivistisk linje hvor man virker for mere eu integration og fortolker alle beslutninger s vidtg ende som overhovedet muligt vi ser udslaget af den tankegang med ef domstolens fortolkning af opholdsdirektivet og dermed dens underminering af dansk udl ndingepolitik
763272 det er jubeleurop erne der helt bevidst har undladt at fort lle danskerne sandheden om ef domstolen nu kan ja partierne v lge enten at blive ved med at lyve danskerne lige op i ansigtet s dan som politikens redakt r t ger seidenfaden opfordrede til forleden eller fort lle den fulde sandhed til befolkningen s vi endelig kan f en mere rlig eu debat det sidste medvirker dansk folkeparti gerne til
763273 det m st klart for enhver at selvom befolkningen er blevet lovet at vi altid kun har afgivet suver nitet i n rmere bestemt omfang s er det et falsum n r vi nu kan se at et omr de hvor vi har et forbehold bliver undergravet af eu

763295 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
763296 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
763297 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
763298 was a panel discussion on the use of profanity in political blogging a times story that ran about netroots of more pressing importance to times readers than michelle obamas first blog post or the aforementioned discussion of how to get taken seriously as a woman political blogger

763300 cdcs new incidence estimates reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
763301 hiv prevention has been underfunded and too often hindered by politics and ideology
763302 since fiscal year 2002 when adjusted for inflation cdcs prevention budget has actually shrunk by 19 percent the president has recently requested decreases in funding for hiv prevention at cdc
763303 less and less money to actually get these programs to the communities that need them
763304 governments to focus on reaching the marginalized populations that are most affected by the epidemic
763305 we face a bit of a crisis in this area in the industrialised world transmission of hiv among men who have sex with men is not declining and in some places has increased
763306 in the developing world it has been neglected we have only recently started looking for it and when we look we find it and when we examine hiv rates we find they are high
763307 any revision of the threat was liable to be seized on by those who rejected hiv as the cause of the disease or who used the disease as a weapon to stigmatise high risk groups he said

763352 esto significa que no podemos simplemente juguetear con un par metro aqu y all realmente tenemos que pensar profundamente sobre qu son nuestras teor as
763353 tal vez no tan condenado como probar que el mundo es plano
763354 una cosa que puedo decir con seguridad es que espero que no funcione porque si pudieses extraer energ a del vac o eso significar a que el vac o no es estable para los f sicos normales
763355 la definici n de vac o es la situaci n de menor energ a posible aquello que tiene menos energ a que cualquier otra cosa
763356 significar a que el universo es mucho m s inestable de lo que jam s so amos

763374 i was dead chuffed when we decided to hold it at alexandra palace theres so much history for the bbc there and it seems perfect to me that the place of birth for tv is the place of birth for a whole load of amazing stuff that can be distributed in so many cool ways ally pally was the first place that broadcast regular hd tv transmissions way back when tv sets were 4 wide it just seems fitting that were now trying to work out how we wire the worlds most advanced studios at the time for wi fi
763375 fancy building something tremendous useful or well a bit weird then yahoo hackday might be for you
763376 it allows people to be creative and come up with ideas that would never get built otherwise so it could be anything from a serious business changing app through to something more fun like mashing up

763378 it sounds to me like a really interesting concept and i reckon some innovative softwares will come out at the end of it and possibly even a few business ventures
763379 ally pally is my back garden my shower will be available for rental on sunday morning
763380 the hackday site is haxorifically cute with all the oldstyle terminal green and text changing as you mouse over it

763389 and i had a meeting with dc comics last monday and they want to do season 4 as a comic series
763390 it may not restore my faith in believing what i do well will create a mass market hit
763391 but i believe there can be a loyal audience for it i believe i can do good television its whether or not i can ever do hit television thats a bit of a mystery to me
763392 being a show runner is such a weird skill set because there are a lot of unrelated personality traits required of the position that dont go naturally hand in hand with being a writer
763393 four years of being in development and not having a show on the air taught me that i love going to work
763394 i like getting up and getting dressed rather than just padding into my office and working on a script im not sure anybody in the world will ever see

763405 christ i dont want to join any of that theyre all off the planet im going to join the independent non aligned party separate from any political organisation
763406 how can we stop the deformations lenin identified from taking place
763407 but if israel attacks iran who are we to condemn it
763408 iran is developing nuclear weapons iran will absolutely use them against israel unless israel strikes first
763409 after stripping out union friendly rhetoric and vague assurances the document was notable principally for the lack of substantive new commitments
763410 business should be heartened by this the government has resisted the worst of union demands
763411 why do nationalists meaning fascists alone insist on spelling out in words of one syllable where they are coming from and where they want to go

763419 el problema actual de la revoluci n cubana y de su proceso de orientaci n socialista es otro y tiene relaci n con lo dicho por fidel en la universidad de la habana en aquel impactante discurso del 5 de noviembre de 2005 advirtiendo sobre lo riesgos de
763420 la reversibilidad la posibilidad de restauraci n capitalista e imposici n imperialista en procesos de de tr nsito al socialismo donde ya hab a sido reemplazado el liderazgo hist rico y entr en crisis su modelo burocr tico ya fue confirmada por la vida en ocasi n del derrumbe del denominado socialismo real euro oriental a final de los 80 y principio de los 90 del siglo pasado independientemente de que no son realidades ni paralelas ni id nticas mucho ha tardado la vanguardia del proceso cubano en examinar a fondo las causas de aquellos fracasos para sacar conclusiones consensuadas a trav s de procesos de discusi n que involucren a todo la sociedad
763421 ha existido una tendencia a que todo el mundo reciba lo mismo y ese igualitarismo no es conveniente
763422 una herramienta que ayude a obtener mejores resultados productivos y de servicios
763423 entre las prioridades del ministerio para enfrentar las dificultades figueroa destac el fortalecimiento de la gesti n de los contratistas la descentralizaci n de la administraci n y la gesti n de las obras

763428 the first significant thing about the world economy is the way in which global economic growth averaging out booms and recessions has not only declined from the golden age of capitalism in the 1950s and 1960s but also from the levels known in the late 1970s and 1980s
763429 but if you look closely at the imf graph he provides it is clear that the growth rate in 2002 06 was no greater than that in 1970 73 with a much lower peak than in 1973 that is in the years that ended in the crisis which spelled the end of the long post war boom
763430 three decades of stagnant real wages and increasing exploitation have substantially restored the rate of profit at the expense of workers this important fact should be acknowledged
763431 the rise and fall of the corporate profit share global corporate profitability maintained its three decade secular trend upward in 2007 interrupted only by a few short lived setbacks as measured by the ratio of profits to nominal gdp the profits share among the major developed economies bottomed in the mid 1970s and slipped in the early 1980s but since then has moved from roughly 6 to over 9 last year in the us profit growth has outpaced nominal gdp growth over the past 25 years by a striking margin of 4 per annum
763432 the past five years have seen a spectacular boom in global profits as of late 2007 profit margins in europe and the us were about 4 2 and 5 2 percentage points respectively above their 20 year average even in japan profit margins have moved well above their historical trend the biggest surge in profits over the past five years has been in emerging markets
763433 global saving and investment as a percent of gdp fell sharply in the decade following the first oil price shock in the early 1970s but were then relatively stable until the late 1990s more recently however they again declined hitting historic lows in 2002 before modestly recovering over the past two years
763434 in other words far from global accumulation showing a rising long term trend as kincaid contends it has been falling
763435 the biggest investment boom in history is under way over half of the worlds infrastructure investment is now taking place in emerging economies where sales of excavators have risen more than fivefold since 2000 in total emerging economies are likely to spend an estimated 1 2 trillion on roads railways electricity telecommunications and other projects this year equivalent to 6 of their combined gdps twice the average infrastructure investment ratio in developed economies
763436 profit margins proxied by the share of profits in gdp have risen steadily to record highs during the past 25 years across most developed economies boosted by a secular fall in the relative price of capital the cost to financing the acquisition of capital and the taxation of capital the relative price of capital goods has fallen due to technological progress as well as increased capital mobility competition and offshoring
763437 the development of the productive power of labour in any one line of production e g the production of iron coal machinery in architecture etc which may again be partly connected with progress in the field of intellectual production notably natural science and its practical application appears to be the premise for a reduction of the value and consequently of the cost of means of production in other lines of industry e g the textile industry or agriculture this is self evident since a commodity which is the product of a certain branch of industry enters another as a means of production its greater or lesser price depends on the productivity of labour in the line of production from which it issues as a product and is at the same time a factor that not only cheapens the commodities into whose production it goes as a means of production but also reduces the value of the constant capital whose element it here becomes and thereby one that increases the rate of profit
763438 now it is true that the first capitalists to innovate get excess profits but as the innovation is generalised across a sector profit rates fall
763439 accumulation in china and to a lesser extent in india has been rising but the chinese economy today is not big enough to be a locomotive that can pull the rest of the world economy behind it
763440 at current exchange rates the imf gave its gdp in 2006 as 2 600 billion just behind germany
763441 asian domestic demand based on thirteen volume indicators is now larger than the us asia current dollar gdp is 59 of the us size but its true size is masked by cheap currencies and labour costs
763442 justifies his claim by referring to a much hyped article by richard freeman which claims
763443 cut the global capital labour ratio by just 55 to 60 percent of what it otherwise would have been
763444 i would also argue that russia and china were part of the world system and in looking at its dynamics you have to take into account their fairly high rates of growth and accumulation 30 or 40 years ago
763445 perhaps more importantly the figures for worldwide employment are fanciful in 2001 the non agricultural workforce of the developing and transition economies was 1 135 million 20 self employment accounted for a high proportion of these 32 percent in asia 44 percent in latin america and 48 percent in africa 21 those proportions have grown everywhere with urbanisation that reduces freeman and kincaids 1 5 billion potential new workers to about 700 million
763446 industrial employment in china actually fell from 78 million in 1997 to 54 4 million in 2001 the fall was due to large scale redundancies in the old industrial sectors which was not compensated for by increased employment in newer sectors despite the massive investment taking place there
763447 after joining the wto in 2001 about 150 million chinese joined the global workforce ninety seven million chinese two thirds of the us labour force have moved to urban areas since 2001 manufacturing and services have gained 88 million workers at the expense of agriculture which lost 47 million people
763448 the additional capital formed in the course of accumulation attracts fewer and fewer labourers in proportion to its magnitude the old capital repels more and more of the labourers formerly employed by it
763449 the organic composition of capital has been rising at a rapid rate in china
763450 the rate of profit has been undergoing a long term fall
763451 in any case profit margins and profit share are not the same as profitability recent studies of profitability in china show it as falling
763452 how can we argue that rising corporate earnings are behind the increase in chinas overall saving rate when we saw that heavy industrial margins actually fell after 2003 the answer is that theres a very big difference between profit margins and total profits and that difference holds the key to understanding just how china could have developed such serious external imbalances over the past half decade margins rose from the end of the 1990s through the early part of this decade but have been flat or even falling since 2003 now consider the ratio of total industrial profits to gdp again a very different story indeed with the profit ratio exploding upward over the last five years
763453 employment growth is only a little over 1 percent a year
763454 with employed workforce only growing at about 1 percent a year despite the vast pools of rural labour
763455 over 60 percent of the population was classified as rural by the 2000 census compared with 80 percent two decades ago
763456 job growth since 1990 has taken place mainly in the urban areas overall job growth averaged just 1 percent since 1990 while jobs in urban areas increased at an average rate of 3 percent a year or 6 5 million a year over the same period job growth in urban areas was achieved despite layoffs at soes equivalent to more than 10 percent of the urban labor force
763457 we begin with empirical evidence that the rate of growth of production has been falling
763458 mostly as a result of a much better than expected trade report but also with support from significantly stronger than expected chain store sales we boosted our 2q gdp forecast to 2 4 from 1 7 an increase of more than three points in the past month
763459 it now appears that us gdp expanded at a 2 5 3 0 pace whereas output contracted in the euro area and japan

763481 there were 20 000 others there they and their families suffered just as badly
763482 in reality they have no idea who had how much dose eric and john had records taken but most had none those who had film badges for the explosions were made to hand them in and they were never labelled to show who was wearing them

763490 its not neighborly to be dumping so much waste that it stinks up the countryside for over half a mile
763491 so strong that it gave me a headache and made me nauseous
763492 we do understand peoples concerns we want to be a good neighbor and it is costing us a considerable amount of money to find other solutions around this
763493 i want to stress this isnt normal business practice this is not something we wanted to do
763494 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
763495 we said prayers for them both at services this morning perry said
763496 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
763497 this project has been going on since 2001 we were only going to put in eight units when we priced out the construction costs and sale prices we changed the concept
763498 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
763499 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
763500 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
763501 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbours
763502 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
763503 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades keep it up
763504 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
763505 along the way i had the opportunity to pass through the dominions of the united fruit convincing me once again of just how terrible these capitalist octopuses are i have sworn before a picture of the old and mourned comrade stalin that i wont rest until i see these capitalist octopuses annihilated in guatemala i will perfect myself and achieve what i need to be an authentic revolutionary
763506 he was critical of the communist parties who he felt had moved away from the working masses by engaging in tactical alliances with the right in order to gain a quota of power
763507 for the first time in his life ernesto openly identified with a political cause for better or worse he had chosen guatemalas leftist revolution
763508 i the eclectic dissector of doctrines and psychoanalyst of dogmas howling like one possessed will assault the barricades or trenches will bathe my weapon in blood and mad with fury will slit the throat of any enemy who falls into my hands
763509 the way in which the gringos treat america had been provoking a growing indignation in me but at the same time i studied the theory behind the reasons for their actions and i found it scientific afterward came guatemala
763510 sooner or later i will join the party more than anything else what impedes me from doing it now is that i still have a fantastic urge to travel through europe and i couldnt do that submitted to an iron discipline
763511 politics were a mechanism for social change and it was social change not power itself that impelled him
763512 now openly admitted his communism and declared his belief in the need for armed revolutionary struggle not only in cuba but throughout latin america
763513 in general che already viewed fidels july 26 colleagues as hopelessly bound by their middle class upbringings and privileged education to timid notions of what their struggle should achieve and he was correct in thinking that they held radically divergent views from his own lacking his marxist conception of a radical social transformation most saw themselves as fighting to oust a corrupt dictatorship and to replace it with a conventional western democracy through isolated conversations he wrote in his diary i discovered the evident anti communist inclinations of most of them
763514 the situation was uncomfortable for the people and for e so i ended the problem giving him a shot with a
763515 this incident was seminal in the growth of ches mystique among the guerrillas and peasants in the sierra maestra from then on he acquired a reputation for a cold blooded willingness to take direct action against transgressors of the revolutionary norms
763516 i belong to those who believe that the solution of the worlds problems lies behind the so called iron curtain and i see this movement as one of the many inspired by the bourgeoisies desire to free themselves from the economic chains of imperialism
763517 we want a strong america master of its own fate an america that can stand up proudly to the united states russia china or any other power that tries to undermine its economic and political independence on the other hand those with your ideological background think the solution to our evils is to free ourselves from the noxious yankee domination by means of a no less noxious soviet domination
763518 the young fighters were clean slates upon whom che made a lasting impression
763519 there is a great mystery surrounding his books and they read them at night in a closed circle thats how he works first he recruits those closest to him and later they go filtering it through the troops
763520 a mystery that has endured over the years is the question of when the soviets became involved with the cuban revolution
763521 the soviet ball started rolling only after castros rebel victory
763522 the revolution was not the result of psp strategy the party was not in control
763523 wanted a socialist cuba and needed ussr aid to do it
763524 they will establish a single party system with fidel as secretary general of the party their ties with the east stem from natural sympathies and common beliefs in the power structure of the social order
763525 our task is to enlarge democracy within the revolution as much as possible and assure channels for the expression of the popular will
763526 no one so much as raised the question of popular democracy or workers control
763527 we are using the almost intuitive method of keeping our ears open to the general reactions in the face of the problems that are posed fidel castro is a master at this in the big public meetings one can observe something like the dialogue of two tuning forks whose vibrations summon forth new vibrations each in the other a dialectical unity which exists between the individual and the mass
763528 he loathed the holier than thou party apparatchiks who sought to impose themselves and their own ideological guidelines throughout cuba
763529 extremely critical of the western communist parties for adopting a peaceful parliamentary strategy for power he said this would deliver the working class bound hand and foot over to the ruling class
763530 to che the term peaceful co existence was anathema mere appeasement of the imperialist system dressed up in diplomatic language for the moment he kept his mouth shut but there was no longer any doubt that his and fidels path had begun to diverge fidels goal was to consolidate cubas economic well being and his own political survival and for that he was willing to compromise ches mission was to spread the socialist revolution
763531 whenever it appears and with all the weapons at our disposal
763532 in direct contradiction to the policy of peaceful co existence his ceaseless calls to armed struggle his emphasis on rural guerrilla warfare and his stubborn determination to train arm and fund communist party dissidents even trotskyists over the protests of their national organisations had led to the growing suspicion in moscow that he was playing maos game
763533 one could truly say that yes che guevara was contaminated by maoism because of his maoist slogan that the rifle can create the power
763534 the argentine was determined to push ahead with the armed struggle in latin america he distrusted the kremlins policy of peaceful co existence and in the sino soviet schism he was on the chinese side
763535 having determined that the soviet pressure on fidel to accept the kremlins socialist model in cuba was overwhelming
763536 i return to the trail with my shield on my arm nothing essential has changed except that i am more conscious my marxism is deeper and more crystallised i believe in the armed struggle as the only solution for the peoples who fight to free themselves and i am consequent with my beliefs
763537 i have come out with more faith than ever in the guerrilla struggle
763538 in cuba it is acknowledged off the record that ches bolivian operation was a total catastrophe from beginning to end
763539 due to the effective organisation of barrientoss political party that is to say his corregidores and political mayors who took charge of warning the army of our movement
763540 an enduring symbol of passionate defiance to an entrenched status quo
763541 there is no room in latin america today for ideas of armed struggles of the collective good not even of sacrifice
763542 if you look the traffic jams in nairobi you have no option but to walk
763543 if we dont do anything to decongest nairobi soon i have no doubt it will come to a standstill in a decade
763544 when you are stuck in a jam you feel a headache you feel disheartened and agitated
763545 you want to flout all the rules just to beat the traffic
763546 i knew it i looked at her and i knew it
763547 they did some then they went and got more this guy gave him way too much he went to sleep and never woke up
763548 these kids are not going to get out from under peer pressure
763549 i tell people if heroin is in your neighbourhood sell your house and get your freaking kid out of there right now get out of dodge
763550 my heart goes out to the parents its just a national tragedy this is supposed to be a beautiful community
763551 unfortunately because it can be snorted kids think the stigma of being a drug addict is removed
763552 theres not the same stigma as when a hard core drug user injects it
763553 if you look at natalie and you hear the description of her you would never in a million years think that she was a child that would use heroin
763554 you ask 10 out of 10 people what a typical heroin addict looks like and theyll say its a junkie in the street with a needle hanging out of their arm
763555 youre not going to see the telltale signs like track marks and needle marks
763556 the kids have been told about the detriment of using cocaine alcohol or marijuana but heroin was never discussed really thats something from a generation ago
763557 a kid was asleep at the table next to them and then his buddy comes out of the bathroom with a needle and blood running down his arm he had heroin in his pocket and he got arrested
763558 i approached her and she told me she got it in school that day
763559 when your daughter has had one overdose and they dont come home we both immediately started crying
763560 how can we be responsible for someone and not have any authority

763582 people say how can you prefer treating patients to being on stage in front of 100 000 people but if you can get someone healthy theres a satisfaction in that which is much more profound
763583 when i met them they were like a gang they looked different they were wearing clothes that no one else was wearing
763584 it took on a life of its own it was like joining a cult i wanted to enjoy playing music and they wanted to suffer it was serious from the moment you got up in the morning until the moment you went to sleep

763586 he didnt let himself be happy the problem with joe was that hed feel guilty if he was comfortable youd be on a sun lounger by a hotel pool having a drink and in five minutes hed get distinctly uneasy and say we should be doing something more purposeful

763605 but the west used the olympic torch relay and the coming games to shame the country and frequently remind the chinese they were not good enough
763606 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
763607 were teaching them that the olympic spirit is international that it doesnt just belong to one country
763608 they said this was the first time that china was communicating to the outside world rather than waiting for the world to come to us
763609 we hoped that the olympics would help people understand our countrys achievements that this ancient civilization has started a new chapter
763610 but from the torch relay we suddenly realized that we were preparing to open the nations front door to welcome people who do not wish us well
763611 here we build sports venues fix rail lines and construct airports hurrying like a raging fire to prepare there people use darfur one day and tibet the next to fan the flames of protest and boycott whats going on
763612 this is a hot face pressed on a cold rump
763613 there were signs of apprehension about the country and its growing power
763614 it was because of cnn and bbcs attitude so we did not broadcast at that time

763627 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
763628 i think a lot of americans dont know a lot about barack obama and legitimately the republican national committee is getting the information out
763629 theres nothing new here its stuff people have known for a long time probably some information in there they dont want to be on the web
763630 apparently john mccain picked up on the internet about as quickly as he picked up on the fact that the economy is going south and the war in iraq is a complete blunder
763631 theyre trying to throw everything they can against the wall and see what sticks
763632 what theyre trying to do is an overall strategy to make obama look like another chicago politician though somewhat different in who he is but not what he is
763633 its always been seen as a place thats been more open and friendly to immigrants
763634 this particular announcement is a further step in making immigrants feel that their rights are going to be protected
763635 finally because we are opposed to discrimination we reject preferences quotas and set asides based on skin color ethnicity or gender which perpetuate divisions and can lead people to question the accomplishments of successful minorities and women
763636 i would push for federal action to carry out a federal responsibility and a federal responsibility is immigration if you have secure borders and you have a temporary worker program that has to do with tamper proof biometric documents you address the issue of the 12 million people who are here illegally and you dont have to worry about all that

763644 senator ted stevens r ak has forfeited his right to serve in the senate and should do the honorable thing and resign his seat immediately the indictment of senator stevens today is an indictment of the career politicians on both sides of the political aisle the career politicians like stevens and my opponent dick durbin have forgotten what the definition of public service really is choosing instead to use the privilege of their office to enrich themselves their family and their special interest friends
763645 complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
763646 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
763647 there was this sense of pride that i had never ever felt before it came from my toes and came all the way up
763648 i have a son and im proud of him i have my wife and im proud of her but this pride
763649 its different you know its different ive been proud waving my rainbow flag but this is different
763650 well win marriage because individual couples get married tell their family friends co workers and community that they are married and talk in very practical terms about why it is so important
763651 people want to keep things dignified they want to take it seriously and they know the world is watching
763652 i think most of it is gay folks are a lot more ordinary than most people think
763653 concerns of people like david brooks that would be the pre school issue in the header
763654 what they didnt say was that halvorson also apparently has had some problems getting paperwork and payments in on time including a 34 penalty tied to a 2004 property tax payment on a condo in springfield
763655 given theyve both had some somewhat similar glitches our guess is that neither side will try to make too much of this as the campaign heads toward november
763656 conveniently progress illinois overlooks democrat debbie halvorsons own tax paying embarrassments ms halvorsons consulting business was involuntarily dissolved in 2004 because she didnt pay business franchise taxes and in 2003 her sixth year as state senator she was personally penalized for paying her springfield condo property taxes late
763657 from the way things look here rahm emanuels dccc attempt to move this weeks campaign discussion away from halvorsons connections to scandal ridden governor blagojevich by finger pointing at ozingas obscure and in comparison miniscule tax mixup is pathetic and laughable

763662 i am pleased to tell you that the entire plot has been illuminated a number of the perpetrators were arrested in light of strong evidence that doesnt leave any room for doubt
763663 the attack is the work of a bloody and separatist terrorist organization it is an inhumane act

763727 illinois needs sweeping ethics reforms to clean up blagojevichs pay to play corruption
763728 our state has become mired in a culture of corruption
763729 its time for executive officers to uphold a higher standard of ethics when representing illinois families i am committed to pushing the nations strictest ethical and anti corruption reforms to eradicate corruption from state government
763730 taxpayers deserve state leaders committed to ethical reform accountable spending and greater transparency on where their tax dollars are being spent
763731 this kind of attack is expected from mrs alvarez because of her own questionable campaign contributions
763732 it is true that my past campaigns did receive contributions from four citizens who ran afoul of the law because i believe the cook county states attorney should avoid even the appearance of impropriety i will voluntarily return the 2 700 in contributions from years ago from those four people in question now i am calling on anita alvarez to return the more than 80 contributions she has received from employees of the states attorneys office and their relatives these people are currently her underlings and will be beholden to her for promotions and pay raises if she is elected i further call on mrs alvarez to return the more than 70 000 in contributions for the states attorneys race she has received from robert clifford her finance committee chairman who makes his living suing the county which mrs alvarez is supposed to defend in fact this past april mr cliffords law firm settled a lawsuit with the county for 100 000 000 how is the public supposed to believe anita alvarez will aggressively defend their interests when she is receiving massive campaign contributions from an attorney who is hired to sue the county and whom the states attorneys office will be opposing in court
763733 these contributions present a clear and present conflict of interest and show clearly that she will be a defender of business as usual in county government
763734 just a year or two ago most of these stores were empty and downtown benton was a depressing place t o visit and that had to change
763735 this is where i was born and raised this is home
763736 it was a great experience to learn from men like that and learn to find good in every situation
763737 thats what well need to turn things around in the 59th district
763738 the people of this district have given their legislators a chance to change things and they are failing
763739 we need private sector jobs and real economic development like the new fedex facility in west frankfort i was pleased to be a part of bringing in those 60 new jobs to the area but then we hear of the boat building company closing down a sign of more hard times for the people of this district we need leadership and ideas to turn things around in this district
763740 and anyway promises like those jobs have been made in the past by the governor only to fall through
763741 theres always hope for more jobs to come here but people of this region have learned not to believe everything a politician tells them
763742 we need to change the way things are done in springfield
763743 that change requires challenging the democrats one party domination in springfield and a vote for democratic incumbent gary forby is a vote to keep senate president emil jones super majority that protects governor blagojevich
763744 were interested in taking back the senate seats we lost in the 2006 beating
763745 were confident ken burzynski is running a good campaign and will give gary forby a run for his money the 59 th district needs representation that wont side with chicago democrats and who will fight for more economic development in this crucial region
763746 ken burzynski will be a leader for those causes in the illinois senate we need him there
763747 i am happy for the children who have an opportunity to experience new trier on a daily basis shouldnt all children have the same opportunity
763748 no matter what the outcome of this lawsuit may bring illinois needs stronger disclosure laws that would force lawmakers to vote on projects before they become reality
763749 many lawmakers agree with us that their actions must be open to review and accountability measures it shouldnt take a lawsuit to force officials elected by the people of this state to do the right thing
763750 this final week before august recess is a defining one congress has the opportunity to show the american people that we have heard their cries for lower energy prices we mustnt let another week pass by without a single substantive vote to lower prices at the pump
763751 while speaker nancy pelosi has said the american peoples call of increased domestic energy production is a
763752 i urge house leaders to simply allow a vote on more american energy

763961 up to last year the thickest cables and the biggest boxes on cable were on demand if the cable was thicker or the boxes on the cable were bigger the perception was such cables should sound better so they sold in better quantities but nowadays waf wife acceptance factor is more involved in it and the wives dont like to see bigger and bigger things corrupting home decoration as a matter of fact we tend to produce thinner cables and smaller boxes in future

763966 while the immediate response to acute stress can be a temporary loss
763967 what are the best muscle mass building exercises to accomplish this
763968 most groups have ended because 1 they joined the political process or 2 local police and intelligence agencies arrested or killed key members military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups
763969 that cannot or will not make a transition to nonviolence policing is likely to be the most effective strategy
763970 a fter september 11 2001 the u s strategy against al qaida centered on the use of military force
763971 u s policymakers and key national security documents referred to operations against al qaida as the war on terrorism emphasis in original
763972 the evidence by 2008 suggested that the u s strategy
763973 in diminishing or even ending the threat from al qaeda but that the groups
763974 policing and intelligence should be the backbone of u s efforts
763975 military force may be a necessary instrument when is involved in an insurgency
763976 they have a better understanding of the operating environment even if they need to develop the capacity to deal with insurgent groups over the long run this means a light u s military footprint or none at all
763977 should include ending the notion of a war on terrorism and replacing it with such concepts as counterterrorism
763978 encourages others abroad to respond by conducting a jihad or holy war against the united states and elevates them to the status of holy warriors terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
763979 suggests that there is no battle eld solution to terrorism military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended it is often over used alienates the local population by its heavy handed nature and provides a window of opportunity for terrorist group recruitment
763980 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
763981 economic political and social development in vulnerable corners of the world
763982 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development
763983 the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
763984 remake it as the global counterinsurgency campaign that it always should have been
763985 military action was the primary cause of a terrorist group meeting its final demise in just seven percent of the time

763987 it would surprise many americans to learn that the worlds greatest deliberative body passes the overwhelming majority of legislation without any debate at all democrats think they are entitled to pass bills without debate or votes and theyve tried to ram them through right before recess to pressure us to give up but senators shouldnt fear debate on these important bills its in the best traditions of our republic to demand the senate actually do its job and have a public debate on bills that expand government and increase the burden on taxpayers senator reid can complain all he wants but republicans represent millions of americans whose voices are being silenced by democrat strong arm tactics
763988 the us senate has a nine percent approval rating because the american people believe that much of our work is done in secret with no debate no transparency and no accountability this report shows that the reality is worse than the publics fears instead of encouraging open debate im disappointed that majority leader reid often chooses secrecy or demagoguery for instance he has depicted my effort to reduce the number of bills that pass the senate in secret by ten percent as unprecedented obstruction what is unprecedented and ahistorical however is the majority leaders view that senators should have a king like right to pass massive spending bills in secret with no debate no amendments and no recorded vote
763989 t he vast majority of measures passed or agreed to by the senate so far in the 110th congress have not received formal parliamentary debate on the floor of the senate
763990 my good friend the late congressman from oklahoma mike synar used to say if you dont want to fight fires dont be a firefighter if you dont want to stop crime dont be a policeman and if you dont want to vote on tough issues dont run for congress

763997 when science moved on and discrediteed these theories no one said that atheism was being pushed into smaller gaps atheism does not demand that such theories be true although it is helped by any credible story of how life could have come about by mindless forces likewise theism was not shaken when scientists learned about the orbits and compositions of comets though some people in earlier times might have felt comforted by the idea of regular miraculous communications from god

763999 forgiveness is no mer discharge of a victims angry resentment and no mere assuaging of a perpretators remorseful anguish one that demands no change of the perpetrator and no righting of wrongs on the contrary every act of forgiveness enthrones justice it draws attention to its violation precisely by offering to forgo its claims moreover forgiveness provides a framework in which the quest for properly understood justice can be fruitfully pursued

764013 good evening signor talamaur my name is isabella mancinelli we have an appointment
764014 good evening ms mancini i am talamaur please come in
764015 i have heard many things about you ms mancini you have been an interesting focus since you have come into the city
764016 from what i hear youre an explorer and have been for some time which is why you have so eagerly sought my attention
764017 forgive me signor talamaur but my name is mancinelli not mancini although i can see the resemblance and how one might be mistaken to some i may appear to be an explorer of sorts but i am only here to find answers to questions that have risen in my studies it was a signor gallo in istanbul that spoke of you and intimated that it would be you that would be able to aid me
764018 i have spent some time in the recently returned archives of the vatican and whilst searching for some unrelated materials i happened across a reference that indicated and forgive me if this may sound fantastical that the mythological creature known as the vampire may in fact not be a myth at all but a true and tangible being i did some further research which indicates that the vampire is resistant to most things and that they are capable of great feats that are beyond the normal reach of mere man it is my thought that if i could find such a creature or being that i could find some way of extracting some of its blood and with some testing perhaps find a way to transfer some of its natural resistances to people such as myself so that the threat of disease could be eradicated the only line i have to follow is the name of the being mentioned in the essay and that was an anton craiovescu the only other reference i could find to that name was an obscure notation in an old parchment that noted the royal families of eastern europe
764019 i have heard of such a creature it has been a long time myth of romania that these creatures live among us hiding in the shadows opportunistically preying upon the flesh of humans i have also been unfourtunately inclined to be accosted by one of these creatures a few times during my stay here most would have considered me insane for spouting such rubbish but the one thing you should always remember in romania all myth attains some truth and what happens in romania stays here unspoken and unchallenged
764020 i have been a historian in romania for many years the scrolls and information i have attained span centuries and much of them have to do with the myth of the vampire and the attributes and truisms in which have been discovered i would be willing to share them with you in your humanitarian quest i only ask that you tell me all you have read and know about anton craiovescu i have heard the name before but i have not been able to dig up much of him

764057 i am originally from northern italy from a town called treviso but i have been working in rome at the vatican they have recently received the archives back there and i was granted papal permission to do some research for the scaligeri family but that is not the point of this i found there the information we have already spoken of and so i set forth to come and find out for myself whether the rumors were true my journey called for me to stop over in istanbul and through speaking with some fellow countrymen i was eventually directed to signor gallo it was after speaking with him and i do hope you are not offended when i say he is a most disreputable fellow that he spoke of his good friend talamaur upon further enquiry it was he that suggested that i come here and seek you out as in his words talamaur is the only one that can show you what you need to see as for anton craiovescu i admit i have made copious notes about him from what i found in the archives and i will have to refer to them in order to give you the most accurate information but for a basic introduction to him i am sure i can remember some he was in the employ of the church as a liaison of sorts between the roman and russian orthodox churches he was renowned for his abilities to seek out those that would be heretics and make examples of them through torture and terror of course in those days it was considered the best and most efficient was of keeping the masses subjugated and with the inquisition in full swing you could say that he was one of there most beloved instruments after the inquisition however and the new direction that the churches had taken it was decided that he was of no further use to them and he was discarded thrown aside like so much offal to anton this was a betrayal most profound for all that he had given to them and this was how he was to be treated the church that day made one of its worst mistakes and anton the benevolent became anton the blasphemer he returned home and used his influence to abolish the churches reach in his lands of course there is much more to his tale than this but for that i shall have to collect my notes
764058 do please forgive my curiosity but are we not returning to my hotel it is after all quite late
764059 i thought you may want to start your research tonight it is said when it comes to gathering information
764060 i glanced outside and a sadistically sinister idea came to rest to the front of my thoughts

764062 if you look to your right you will find the room with all of my scrolls if you will follow me i shall show you the ones you may find of interest
764063 on this table is everything that you may be looking for dozens of scrolls and books that i am sure you will find of extreme interest

764091 its a new country a new challenge and a club that plays at a high level what they offered me is almost the same as what brann offered but its always better to have a new challenge and my family are happy with me to go to a new country that is why i signed

764296 yes that was the reason why we did it because he came to live with us
764297 ah right okay because hes just talking about that memory here of a ceiling just being propped up
764298 he must have been getting or knowing that he was getting frailer or more ill
764299 at that point because im just getting this feeling from him the guy was pretty brave in all this he knew he was on his way out he knew that he was in his final time
764300 he moved in with you he must have been like really sick was he dying still brave guy i bet should we change the subject now only you look a bit emotional
764301 so can you understand why arthur is so indignant about this idea that a stairlift is not the answer

764304 and it had a kitchen with a sink and cupboards

764316 can you understand why hes showing me please and i feel as though its got to be memorable in some way a huge jar of marmite
764317 right i know that in this that he wants to send his love to someone where theres this connection to this big jar of marmite
764318 oh right okay i can see him quite defiantly in my mind standing there saying now listen doesnt matter whether we like him or not
764319 and i have to actually come over and actually say look when you first come on the scene he didnt actually wasnt sure whether he liked you or not
764320 no every time i walked into the room he walked out
764321 yeah okay so hes saying no come on lets learn from experience here it doesnt matter whether we like him or not
764322 as much as he wants to send his love to you my love and he really does and also to his grandchildren and everything its his son in law mostly that he wanted to talk to today just to say i just need to thank you or just saving me from so much embarrassment and so many indignities

764607 i bring you warm greetings from our sister barack obama a political prisoner trapped in a tiny mind and prone to lashing out
764608 he thinks hes too good to visit wounded u s soldiers
764609 what do they know they only listed 50 states what about the other 8
764610 the obama campaign scrapped the troop visit after the pentagon told them it would be viewed as a campaign event
764611 the pentagon said friday that it did no prevent an obama visit
764612 nobody denied senator obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and certainly visit in an official capacity
764613 senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event
764614 we do have certain policy guidelines for political campaigns and elections and what is appropriate and what is not appropriate in those situations but the pentagon certainly did not tell the senator that he could not visit landstuhl
764615 usually everyone lies for him but the pentagons not going to do that for him and now hes exposed as the man who decided to skip out on wounded service members after he was informed he couldnt turn it into a campaign stop if a tree falls in the forest when no one is around did it make a sound if barack emotes with no cameras around he thinks it wont make for a media sound byte so it was okay for him to blow off us soldiers how disgusting is he
764616 one military official who was working on the obama visit said because political candidates are prohibited from using military installations as campaign backdrops obamas representatives were told he could only bring two or three of his senate staff member no campaign officials or workers obama could nto bring any media only military photographers would be permitted to record obamas visit
764617 the most disappointing thing about this ad is that its beneath john mcain because hes playing political football with wounded soldiers
764618 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he
764619 i think a lot of people are wondering what happened to the civil campaign john mccain said he was going to run
764620 green spoke last weekend at the national now convention one that was subdued rather than boisterous in the wake of hillary clintons primary defeat by barack obama some now delegates wore hillary tee shirts there was minimal talk of obama and loud cheers whenever someone mentioned clinton
764621 we increased womens turnout by 200 percent in the democratic primaries gosh we came really close to nominating hillary i also was disheartened when i saw young women vilify senator clinton and vilify being a feminist
764622 obama draws an adoring crowd of 200 000 in berlin he pulls ahead in national polls meanwhile mccain who has run a near disastrous campaign inches up in key swing states go figure i say give obama the guitar he so richly deserves and make him a rock star give mccain a war to run somewhere and let voters redo the primaries so they can nominate two more mainstream candidates anyone who says the election is over and obama is the victor reminds me of the obama partisans drumming sen hillary clinton out of the race and turning off millions of potential democratic supporters in the process they do their candidate a much greater service if they duct tape their mouths
764623 while coverage of senator obamas berlin speech provided audiences here at home nothing less than a visual shock and awe it neglected to mention that the well hyped speech had an opening act a gratis concert by two wildly popular groups reggae artist patrice and rock band reamonn pictured below with barack obama while we appreciate the obama campaigns hospitality on behalf of furthering us germany relations offering free bratwurst pizza and even beer for three hours during the free rock concert we question whether or not the monies might have been better spent here on financially strapped us citizens similarly back on may 20 2008 in portland oregon senator obama took the stage following the critically acclaimed local band the decemerists who gave a rare free concert for 75 000 fans while news stories generated by both appearances focused on the enormity of the crowd size few mentioned the accompanying perks leaving some to question whether revelers are showing up for senator obama or for free food and entertainment without this additional information just say no deal contends that americans are being misled about the presumptive democratic nominees true popularity
764624 all that talk about baracks my man makes it sound like hes baracks butt boy he sounds like hes lusting after obama
764625 move bitch get out the way get out the way bitch get out the way
764626 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
764627 supposedly he had left boot camp in december for christmas break i guess he decided he didnt want to be in the army anymore so he fled to brampton
764628 i was really interested in aviation and having a career in aviation one day the air force recruiter came to school and i was talking to her about joining the military as an air force maintenance technician and eventually working to become a pilot
764629 more of a liberal lean towards politics so i started seeing it through those eyes and thats when i started becoming a little discontent with the war and the government but i was still ready to go
764630 i just questioned a lot of things i was being taught
764631 it just seemed like a really hateful angry situation i didnt want to be in
764632 wow yeah this is what i am this is what im going to apply for so i can get out of the military
764633 democrat led congress are as unconcerned about political justice as is any neo con in rupert murdochs rolodex
764634 to waste time with your silliness barack is president he is king he is ruler of the universe he is master of the game like dyan cannon he wants it all
764635 when we arrived al assad this was april or the beginning of may 2003
764636 and this is the very beginning of the occupation and this is when we were being told that we had to keep people on sleep deprivation to psychological torture the orders came from way up top actually the people who were in charge of running these camps were ghost agents you know working for the us government and when the abu ghraib scandal came out they tried to tell the american public that you know this was an isolated event that had only began in november or december of 2003 and that it was the result of a few people you know who one day woke up and you know they were evil when in reality you know from from my experience i can tell you that this was actually something that was coming from the very top and that happened from the very beginning and that it was not isolated to abu ghraib but that was happening elsewhere in iraq from the very beginning of the occupation
764637 well in the military we have what is called spooks and these are people who are highly trained in counterinsurgency theyre highly trained in linguistics and interrogation and weapons systems and things like that and they dont wear name tags they dont wear unit id badges or anything like that they use pseudonyms and you know they dont respond to anybody in uniform they they basically take their orders from from the very top and theyre theyre untraceable and and obviously you know they can conduct themselves with absolute impunity these were people who were giving the commands when we were there not our commanders not the people who belonged to any unit you know but basically people with top secret clearance and you know who would never be held accountable for any of the things that happened

764639 when the president of the united states goes and gives a speech it is not a political speech or a political rally
764640 armed with a 74 page grand jury presentation two weeks ago alleged that democratic house employees worked to challenge the 51 273 signatures nader and running mate peter camejo had gathered for access to the 2004 presidential ballot a dozen former and current house democratic lawmakers and employees face theft conspiracy and conflict of interest charges partly for their alleged role in derailing naders campaign
764641 nader wants relief from an 81 102 penalty for legal costs following court battles over his presidential nomination petition in 2004 he said he will file a challenge with the state supreme court nader said those damages should be dropped in light of criminal charges brought this month
764642 this was one of the most fraudulent and deceitful exercises ever perpetrated on pennsylvania voters
764643 according to the grand jury millions of dollars in taxpayer funds resources and state employees were illegally used for political campaign purposes including to remove the nader camejo ticket from the ballot
764644 why should i say anything myself isnt it obvious that i agree with him
764645 who enlisted in the army in 2001 when he was 18
764646 teaching units what they needed to know before they went over to a combat area we pretty much put them through a month long simulation of combat
764647 it was more of like there wasnt a lot of action it was more of its hard to explain down there action over there is like getting ied or maybe getting shot at a few times or a car bomb goes off its not exactly what youre expecting its more like hunting season youre the deer
764648 in my case i had lost a lot while i was over there and it just started the more you lose and the less they do for you the more you start to see how jacked up things really are
764649 and theres plenty they could do and they just they did nothing i lost a lot of money i lost my family while i was there you know pretty much and when i get back id lost so much it was like i needed to start over
764650 man i got to have a reset i got to find a way to get myself out of this and start over start my life over you know i have nothing to work with
764651 rapper ludacris obama declined to comment after their meeting but walked with chris bridges ludacris legal name to the elevator as he left

764653 obama seeking to become the first african american president was not helped by a song by the grammy award winning rapper ludacris endorsing him and abusing mccain george bush and clinton
764654 on youtube yesterday rapper ludacris released a song called politics in which he denigrates president bush sen hillary rodham clinton d n y and sen john mccain r ariz all in the space of about two minutes in the next line the three time grammy award winner calls clinton an irreleveant slur for female
764655 wow thats fantastic but you need an adult to help you out because you have to be a registered voter
764656 but before we get into logistics i dont often get calls from 16 year olds can you tell me how you know about ralph
764657 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
764658 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
764659 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
764660 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
764661 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people
764662 ah voters are just feeling blue and the claws come out periodically
764663 the oregonian july 16 2007 would break the news of james burmeister and of the kill teams targeting iraqi civilians
764664 i think my son is a hero there are many iraqis who were not killed because of what he did and many gis whose lives were saved because of it he made a tremendous service to his country by standing up and bearing witness to the bait and kill war crimes
764665 i feel like the case was used as an example to other soldiers not only will you get punished but your loved ones will be too
764666 im very disappointed in the way they feel they can treat veterans of war i think the reason my son went awol was for a good reason i dont think he deserved the punishment he got

764668 precisely because i have not served in uniform i am somebody who strongly believes i have to earn the trust of men and women in uniform
764669 having declared afghanistan a good war the complicit enablers are now anointing barack obama as he tours the bloodfests in afghanistan and iraq what they never say is that obama is a bomber in the new york times on 14 july in an article spun to appear as if he is ending the war in iraq obama demanded more war in afghanistan and in effect an invasion of pakistan he wants more combat troops more helicopters more bombs bush may be on his way out but the republicans have built an ideological machine that transcends the loss of electoral power because their collaborators are as the american writer mike whitney put it succinctly bait and switch democrats of whom obama is the prince
764670 obama is being consumed as the embodiment of colour blindness
764671 its the notion that we have moved beyond racism by not taking race into account thats what makes him conceivable as a presidential candidate hes become the model of diversity in this period a model of diversity as the difference that makes no difference the change that brings no change
764672 support for an open ended us military presence in iraq
764673 some of your advisors have said it could be tens of thousands of troops why cant you be more specific as to what you envision
764674 as ive said before i am not interested in a false choice between either perfect inflexibility in which the next 16 months or the next two years i ignore anything thats happening in iraq or alternatively that i just have an open ended indefinite occupation of iraq in which were not putting any pressure on the iraqis to stand up take this burden on what im gonna do is to set a vision of where we need to go a clear and specific timeframe within which were gonna pull our combat forces out
764675 obama is always talking about his past as a community organizer but again and again day after day hes back tracking surrendering flip flopping and appointing the worst corporatist advisors you can imagine
764676 they represent a minority viewpoint we represent a majority of the american people
764677 if you dont resist the situation gets worse the alternative is surrender the stands mccain and obama have taken again and again do not have the support of the majority of the american people
764678 why arent these issues talked about by the major parties
764679 ralph nader is a step closer to getting his name on missouris presidential ballot robert dalaviras state coordinator for the nader campaign delivered two boxes of petitions to the secretary of states office in jefferson city this morning
764680 a comprehensive negotiated military and corporate withdrawal date from iraq
764681 a single payer canadian style private delivery free choice public health insurance system for all
764682 a living wage and repeal of the anti union taft hartley act
764683 a no nuke solar based energy policy supported by renewable sustainable energy efficient sources
764684 an end to corporate welfare and corporate crime that has resulted in millions losing pensions savings and jobs and squandered tax dollars
764685 more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with we the people and not we the corporations
764686 this is the worst state in the country in terms of denying voters their own choice of candidates

764712 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
764713 the u s government paid a california contractor 142 million to build prisons fire stations and police facilities in iraq that is has nver built or finished
764714 sigir reviewed the largest task order task order 51 which called for parsons to design and construct 21 fire stations in anbar and baghdad because of multiple delays and cost increases the u s government reduced the number of stations to be constructed to 100 later another fire station was eliminated before construction began because of land ownership issues and a second was terminated for the convenience of the government after it was bombed twice during construction leaving nine in 2006 parsons completed the nine fire stations and transferred them to the goi the award fee paid to parsons for wok on this tark order was 296 294 23 of the total available award fee
764715 a leader in many diverse markets such as infrastructure transportation water telecommunications aviation commerical environmental industrial manufacturing education healthcare life scienes and homeland security
764716 suggested the government needed to rethink its heavy dependence on the private sector for reconstruction security and support in a combat environment the comments are unusual for the leader of a firm that makes much of its money doing work for the government then again few have been battered as badly as parsons an employee owned california base compnay with a six decade track record since the spring when news of the stumbling health clinic program first broke the companys preformance has been derided in the press and upt under the microscope at congressional hearings at a hearing in september rep henry a waxman d calif spoke of a 75 million police academy that parsons was responsible for but that wend badly awry this is the lens through which iraqis will now see america incompetence profiteering arrogance and human waste oozing out of ceilings as a result
764717 it is looked at as profiteering and we shouldnt have that go on a time when weve got brave american men and women who are facing the possibility of giving their lives to help the u s effort
764718 we are somehow taking advantage of either the iraqi people or our government
764719 i dont think anybody ought to get paid and be able to keep the money if they didnt do what they were supposed to do then they found that the iraqi subcontractors didnt do the work so why should the united states taxpayers pay for that we should get our money back
764720 there is nothing wrong with our firm having made a profit on that work that we did over there in iraq it was legitimately earned it was honestly earned and none of our employees nor our firm should feel the least bit bad about that
764721 getting a definitive answer on the number of clinics completed by parsons is not easy of the original 151 promised the construction company says it handed over 20 fully equipped completed health care centers the army corps of engineers disputes that number saying it received only six completed clinics some of those needed additional work the corps says
764722 iraqs oil revenues will crest 70 billion by the end of the year
764723 about 142 million was spent on various parsons projects that were ultimately canceled or not completed including kahn bani saad
764724 this meant the government was capable of fundign reconstruction projects itself the report also criticised the iraqi authorities for failing to improve sewage and drainage facilities roger hardy the bbcs middle east analyst said the report was the latest in a string of criticisms by the watchdog of the way in which american taxpayers money is being spent in iraq
764725 democratic leaders in congress are pushing the administration to pressure the iraqi government to fund its own infrastructure projects through rising oil revenue
764726 military officers both iraqi and americans said the insurgents had probably fled the are after news media reports that the sweep was to begin soon though officials had been saying publicly that it would be likely to begin in early august
764727 iraqi soldiers and national police encountered no resistance as they knock in baqubah and the town of khan bani saad about 15 miles south but this is well trod ground for the iraqi forces and their u s counterparts who have conducted repeated operations in the area since last year
764728 called on iraqs leaders not to sign a security deal with the united states offering to throw his support behind the government if the talks were scrapped
764729 democrat led congress are as unconcerned about political justice as is any neo con in rupert murdochs rolodex

764734 man i got to have a reset i got to find a way to get myself out of this and start over start my life over you know i have nothing to work with
764735 in other iraq news the british government has announced there will be no prosecutions over the death of journalist terry lloyd despite an investigation that blamed us troops terry lloyd was shot dead in iraq in march 2003 along with a french cameraman and an iraqi interpreter two years ago a british coroner ruled that us troops should be prosecuted for the unlawful killing of lloyd who was a well known foreign correspondent for the british television network itn the coroner ruled that lloyd was shot in the back by iraqi soldiers then as he was being driven to a hospital in a civilian minivan lloyd was shot in the head by us troops
764736 coroner andrew walker concluded just under two years ago that terry lloyd was unlawfully killed by american troops and itn has done everything it could to try and ensure terrys killer is brought to justice we are disappointed that the cps has decided they cannot take this matter further and that despite the coroners call on the attorney general and the director of public prosecutions to demand that the americans bring the perpretator of a possible war crime before a british court of law the us authorities remain unco operative
764737 any accusations against a journalist should be aired publicly and dealt with fairly and swiftly with the journalist having the right to counsel and present a defense
764738 often stayed late at his fathers newsroom in kirkuk the editor in chief of the weekly voice of villages ali taha treated his son as a journalist in training the teen listened to pop music and was obsessed with computer games he loved the weekly trips he took with his father to sites in the area the most recent trip was to the dokan dam the primary water source in kirkuk he loved to stay late into the night at the voice of villages newsroom a u s supported weekly and help in any way he could who knows what he wouldve been when he grew up who knows what life he wouldve lived god had other plans his father said
764739 this has been a month of encouraging news from iraq
764740 this week the iraqi government is launching a new offensive in parts of the diyala province that contain some of al qaedas few remaining safe havens in the country this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
764741 unofficial deadline for the deal has long been july 31 also the white house announced late on wednesday that president bush would make a statement on iraq on thursday morning

764747 obama seeking to become the first african american president was not helped by a song by the grammy award winning rapper ludacris endorsing him and abusing mccain george bush and clinton
764748 on youtube yesterday rapper ludacris released a song called politics in which he denigrates president bush sen hillary rodham clinton d n y and sen john mccain r ariz all in the space of about two minutes in the next line the three time grammy award winner calls clinton an irreleveant slur for female
764749 wow thats fantastic but you need an adult to help you out because you have to be a registered voter
764750 but before we get into logistics i dont often get calls from 16 year olds can you tell me how you know about ralph
764751 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
764752 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
764753 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
764754 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
764755 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people
764756 i think my son is a hero there are many iraqis who were not killed because of what he did and many gis whose lives were saved because of it he made a tremendous service to his country by standing up and bearing witness to the bait and kill war crimes
764757 i feel like the case was used as an example to other soldiers not only will you get punished but your loved ones will be too
764758 im very disappointed in the way they feel they can treat veterans of war i think the reason my son went awol was for a good reason i dont think he deserved the punishment he got
764759 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
764760 i cant practice democracy at the parliament while the dictatorship is attacking and burning the headquarters of the turkmen front in kirkuk and burning and looting other turkmen establishments
764761 the bombing and reprisals provided a glimpse of the passions among kurds turkmens and arabs over the future boundaries of iraqs arab north and its kurdistan region
764762 where there are only families who earn their living raising sheep this is the first time that turkish planes have attacked during the day we have not received any information about casualties
764763 a reuters witness said large numbers of iraqi police and army personnel had deployed in baquba where they were searching homes the u s military was present in small numbers backed by helicopters the witness said
764764 i think this allowed armed groups to flee outside the province
764765 apart from the deployment in baquba iraqi and us forces conducted raids in several outlying areas
764766 this act is a clear evidence that the iraqi state seeks to liquidate trade unions in this important iraqi economic sector it is important to note that the south is the main source of oil in iraq
764767 we told hussain al shahristani the iraqi oil minister that this was not acceptable and informed him that we were aware of the measures being taken by the oil ministry
764768 the withdrawal of the order is a victory for international solidarity and iraqi trade unions
764769 to hold an international labor conference in iraq in february 2009 this is an important and urgent step toward strengthening and unifying the labor movement in iraq only through increased solidarity in iraq and with workers in the region and around the world can we hope to impact the fate not only of workers but of all iraqis learn more we call upon all unions and other labor organizations and individual union members and others around the world to support this conference morally and financially
764770 once the u s occupation of iraq began over a year ago iraqi workers lost no time in reorganizing their countrys labor movement labor activity spread from baghdad to the kurdish north with the center of the storm in the south in the oil and electrical installations around basra and the port of um qasr workers quickly discovered that the occupation authorities had little respect for labor rights however
764771 iraq is in the grip of a water crisis after this years seasonal rains failed wiping out crops in some parts of the country and causing an unusually high number of sandstorms because the land is so dry dams and reservoirs in neighbouring turkey and syria have made the problem worse the level of water in the tigris and the euphrates the rivers that flow from the two countries into iraq has fallen by more than 60 per cent over the past 20 years
764772 precisely because i have not served in uniform i am somebody who strongly believes i have to earn the trust of men and women in uniform
764773 having declared afghanistan a good war the complicit enablers are now anointing barack obama as he tours the bloodfests in afghanistan and iraq what they never say is that obama is a bomber in the new york times on 14 july in an article spun to appear as if he is ending the war in iraq obama demanded more war in afghanistan and in effect an invasion of pakistan he wants more combat troops more helicopters more bombs bush may be on his way out but the republicans have built an ideological machine that transcends the loss of electoral power because their collaborators are as the american writer mike whitney put it succinctly bait and switch democrats of whom obama is the prince
764774 obama is being consumed as the embodiment of colour blindness
764775 its the notion that we have moved beyond racism by not taking race into account thats what makes him conceivable as a presidential candidate hes become the model of diversity in this period a model of diversity as the difference that makes no difference the change that brings no change
764776 support for an open ended us military presence in iraq
764777 some of your advisors have said it could be tens of thousands of troops why cant you be more specific as to what you envision
764778 as ive said before i am not interested in a false choice between either perfect inflexibility in which the next 16 months or the next two years i ignore anything thats happening in iraq or alternatively that i just have an open ended indefinite occupation of iraq in which were not putting any pressure on the iraqis to stand up take this burden on what im gonna do is to set a vision of where we need to go a clear and specific timeframe within which were gonna pull our combat forces out
764779 the amrican people thus will be given the choice on november 4 of voting for war 1 or war 2 iraq or afghanistan in fact they will be saddled with both wars with only slight differences between the democrats and republicans over which war should receive the largest proportion of us military resources those who oppose american militarism who want to bring an end to the oppression and violence wrought by imperialist aggression throughout the middle east and central asia have been disenfrancised by the two big business parties
764780 obama is always talking about his past as a community organizer but again and again day after day hes back tracking surrendering flip flopping and appointing the worst corporatist advisors you can imagine
764781 they represent a minority viewpoint we represent a majority of the american people
764782 if you dont resist the situation gets worse the alternative is surrender the stands mccain and obama have taken again and again do not have the support of the majority of the american people
764783 why arent these issues talked about by the major parties

764790 more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with we the people and not we the corporations
764791 this is the worst state in the country in terms of denying voters their own choice of candidates
764792 also on friday the american military acknowledged that it unintentionally killed the son of an editor for an american financed newspaper in the northern city of kirkuk on thursday the military said soldiers had been fired at from a taxi and shot back hitting arkan al naiemi 14 in the taxi
764793 said the image of his fathers burning vehicle haunts him hed waited in his fathers office that morning surprised that he wasnt there yet theyd left at nearly the same time that morning
764794 why did they kill him like this we demand that they send those soliders to an iraqi and american court
764795 it was only 10 000 my father was the main provider for our family we are a displace people we also have to replace our car we are in a very difficult time
764796 the findings call into question the way the military handled the aftermath of the shootings
764797 initially some soldiers thought that someone in the car was shooting and that iraqi police had found a weapon in the vehicle the miltiary said however no weapon was found and the passengers turned out to be a man and two women who worked at the airport bank
764798 early today 20 civilians were killed and 47 wounded by three female suicide bombers in eastern baghdad as shiite pilgrims marched to the imam kadhim shrine in west baghdad an interior ministry official said the attacks happened a day before a religious festival marking the death of the revered shiite figure who died in 799
764799 the pilgrims were walking through the karrada district of central baghdad towards kadhimiyah in the citys north where up to a million people will celebrate a shia festival when the bombers struck
764800 the bombers struck in quick succession in the karrada district of central baghdad as tens of thousands of shia pilgrims were making their way on foot towards kadhimiyah in the north of the iraqi capital site of todays shia festival a ceremony that has been marred by bloodshed in the past
764801 thousands of shiite muslims walk through this popular shopping district here in baghdad mournful religious sermons blare from speakers set up to greet them
764802 kurdish objections over a proposed power sharing formula on the provincial council in kirkuk have blocked the law from being passed kirkuk is in an oil rich area and many kurds consider it to be part of their historical land the area is home to kurds turkomen arabs and smaller groups
764803 the obama campaign scrapped the troop visit after the pentagon told them it would be viewed as a campaign event
764804 the pentagon said friday that it did no prevent an obama visit
764805 nobody denied senator obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and certainly visit in an official capacity
764806 senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event
764807 we do have certain policy guidelines for political campaigns and elections and what is appropriate and what is not appropriate in those situations but the pentagon certainly did not tell the senator that he could not visit landstuhl
764808 usually everyone lies for him but the pentagons not going to do that for him and now hes exposed as the man who decided to skip out on wounded service members after he was informed he couldnt turn it into a campaign stop if a tree falls in the forest when no one is around did it make a sound if barack emotes with no cameras around he thinks it wont make for a media sound byte so it was okay for him to blow off us soldiers how disgusting is he
764809 one military official who was working on the obama visit said because political candidates are prohibited from using military installations as campaign backdrops obamas representatives were told he could only bring two or three of his senate staff member no campaign officials or workers obama could nto bring any media only military photographers would be permitted to record obamas visit
764810 the most disappointing thing about this ad is that its beneath john mcain because hes playing political football with wounded soldiers
764811 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he
764812 i think a lot of people are wondering what happened to the civil campaign john mccain said he was going to run
764813 green spoke last weekend at the national now convention one that was subdued rather than boisterous in the wake of hillary clintons primary defeat by barack obama some now delegates wore hillary tee shirts there was minimal talk of obama and loud cheers whenever someone mentioned clinton
764814 we increased womens turnout by 200 percent in the democratic primaries gosh we came really close to nominating hillary i also was disheartened when i saw young women vilify senator clinton and vilify being a feminist
764815 obama draws an adoring crowd of 200 000 in berlin he pulls ahead in national polls meanwhile mccain who has run a near disastrous campaign inches up in key swing states go figure i say give obama the guitar he so richly deserves and make him a rock star give mccain a war to run somewhere and let voters redo the primaries so they can nominate two more mainstream candidates anyone who says the election is over and obama is the victor reminds me of the obama partisans drumming sen hillary clinton out of the race and turning off millions of potential democratic supporters in the process they do their candidate a much greater service if they duct tape their mouths
764816 while coverage of senator obamas berlin speech provided audiences here at home nothing less than a visual shock and awe it neglected to mention that the well hyped speech had an opening act a gratis concert by two wildly popular groups reggae artist patrice and rock band reamonn pictured below with barack obama while we appreciate the obama campaigns hospitality on behalf of furthering us germany relations offering free bratwurst pizza and even beer for three hours during the free rock concert we question whether or not the monies might have been better spent here on financially strapped us citizens similarly back on may 20 2008 in portland oregon senator obama took the stage following the critically acclaimed local band the decemerists who gave a rare free concert for 75 000 fans while news stories generated by both appearances focused on the enormity of the crowd size few mentioned the accompanying perks leaving some to question whether revelers are showing up for senator obama or for free food and entertainment without this additional information just say no deal contends that americans are being misled about the presumptive democratic nominees true popularity

764818 as teenagers scores on standardized reading tests have declined or stagnated some argue that the hours spent prowling the internet are the enemy of reading diminishing literacy wrecking attention spans and destroying a precious common culture that exists only through the reading of books but others say the internet has created a new kind of reading one that schools and society should not discount the web inspires those who might otherwise spend most of her leisure time watching television to read and write

764868 as an executive recruiting firm we have a unique vantage point from which to observe the latest trends taking place in industry

764870 no longer is it acceptable for candidates to claim to have a lean sigma or lean six sigma background
764871 companies want to see candidates that have the hardcore lean experience gained in a true lean transformation setting and that cant be gained from an environment where lean is an afterthought or a lesser appendage to an existing six sigma program
764872 this is certainly a major center of gravity shift from our first study in 2005 where six sigma talent demand outpaced lean by more than 50 percent
764873 however in the end the real winner is any company that successfully engages in some form of continuous improvement regardless of whether it is lean six sigma or some other well executed combination of both

765060 nota para una reflexi n epistemol gica sobre la ense anza
765061 pedagog a nombra una disciplina en formaci n que utilizando modelos y conceptos de otras disciplinas busca plantear m todos para los problemas de la ense anza y no un m todo para la ense anza aunque su esencia como saber concreto es el m todo ste no debe pensarse como un simple procedimiento pues est soportado y las fuentes de la pedagog a dan cuenta de ello por una trama de nociones que se refieren a la formaci n del hombre al conocimiento al lenguaje a la selecci n del saber a la escuela y su funci n social a la concepci n del maestro
765062 el discurso instruccional presupone el proceso de recontextualizaci n mediante el cual los discursos han sido hist ricamente removidos del campo de su producci n transformados y transferidos al campo educativo o de reproducci n este proceso de recontextualizaci n es relativamente complejo e implica un campo de recontextualizaci n oficial y un campo de recontextualizaci n pedag gica

765069 una ciencia que pretende entender interpret ndola la acci n social para de esa manera explicarla causalmente en su desarrollo y efectos por acci n debe entenderse una conducta humana siempre que el sujeto o sujetos de la acci n anlacen a ella un sentido subjetivo

765089 en general se concibe que una prueba de aptitud intenta medir ciertos rasgos psicol gicos estables unitarios y algo independientes que se estiman son requisitos para un trabajo o para el estudio de una especialidad dada ejemplos de estas caracter sticas son memoria fluidez verbal percepci n espacial razonamiento verbal etc

765464 the first neutrons met all of our technical performance predicitions and creating them is a significant milestone in the life of the facility and in the completion of the project
765465 the isis second target station builds on the success and expertise we have developed over the past 20 years at isis and allows us to move further into the areas of soft matter advanced materials and bioscience we will be carrying out fundamental research that will shape the technological advances of tomorrow
765466 this is an incredible technical achievement by our staff and demonstrates how everyone can pull together and enable stfc to deliver massive science projects that underpin the long term future of science and innovation in the uk
765467 im very proud of every single person who has played a part in getting the isis second target station project through to this very important milestone
765468 this is tremendous news for the science community both in the uk and much further afield
765469 the isis second target station will open research into new types of materials that has not been previously possible at isis and we look forward to a world of new science flowing from the new instrument suite
765470 this is a remarkable achievement by the isis team and adds an exciting new dimension to the capabilities of the european neutron scattering toolkit
765471 isis is the worlds leading spallation neutron facility and has performed world class outstanding science
765472 adding the second target station is the next great step for isis to enhance the ability and extend the reputation of neutron sciences world wide
765473 together with the great scientific environment at isis the skilful design and the mature know how in neutron technology applied on the second target station will open up unexplored areas for pulsed cold neutron experiments isis can stay as the world leader even as more powerful spallation neutron sources such as j parc and the us spallation neutron source come online
765474 we made a good effort today of recording our first demo in apollo studios we started at 5 pm but didnt start recording till 9 because we had to get a good sound set up miking drums amps getting a good sound for the guitars surprisingly dutch diva the song we are loath to play since we know it so well and everyone keeps requesting it turned out to be the most difficult to record we spent 3 hours on it or thereabouts i guess we had to get warmed up and the solo was tricky to get right i ended up recording it in 3 parts given the nature of it and time constraints then we got vampire bitches done in 3 takes that was weird there is one wrong note in the finger tapping bit for the solo to that song but its hardly noticeable as a mistake i over dubbed the solo aswell to get a cool sound we left at around 2 am and negotiated temple bar without getting stabbed

765495 ma qui non si tratta di chi ragione e chi ha torto la missione non umiliare laltro qui si tratta solo di monete e i negozianti non ne hanno a prescindere dal modo in cui io le chieda

765526 publicly engaged academic work is scholarly or creative activity integral to a faculty members academic area it encompasses different forms of making knowledge about for and with diverse publics and communities through a coherent purposeful sequence of activities it contributes to the public good and yields artifacts of public and intellectual value
765527 one should recognize that research teaching and community outreach often overlap for example a service learning project may refl ect both teaching and community outreach some research projects may involve both research and community outreach pedagogical research may involve both research and teaching when a faculty member evaluates his or her individual intellectual aesthetic or creative accomplishments it is more important to focus on the general criteria of the quality and significance of the work than to categorize the work

765531 but woe to you pharisees for you tithe mint and rue and herbs of all kinds and neglect justice and the love of god it is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others
765532 jesus went on to say that none of the laws had been erased

765549 for the time being obama maintains the edge and has the strength of a majority of electoral votes his triumphant foreign trip allows him to continue to define this race but too many of these states are close and a sizable number are undecided or choosing a third party candidate so there is a lot of fluidity

765605 most journals in india and other developing countries face the challenges of shortage of quality articles poor international recognition maintaining publication schedule and managing the finances many of these problems are inter linked and are related to the journals visibility most of these journals have limited circulation beyond their own country the limited visibility and accessibility of the journals leads to poor citation and impact factor which in turn repel the authors and subscribers free online access to the journals content has to potential to solve this long standing problem of journals from the developing world
765606 disseminating research via the web is appealing but it lacks journals peer review quality filter says philip altbach
765607 what publishing does well traditional publishing that is where you pay for what you read whether in print or online is command attention this is not a trivial matter in a world that seemingly generates more and more information effortlessly but still has the poor reader stuck with something close to the biblical lifespan of three score and ten and a clock that stubbornly insists that a day is 24 hours and no more attention is the scarce commodity any service that makes those 24 hours more productive is welcome a service that winnows through the huge outpouring of information and says with authority pay attention to this pay less attention to that and as for that other thing ignore it entirely such a service is well worth paying for the name of that service is publishing
765608 in the age of the internet the ways you share and use academic research results are changing rapidly fundamentally irreversibly theres great potential in change after all faster and wider sharing of journal articles research data simulations syntheses analyses and other findings fuels the advance of knowledge its a two way street sharing research benefits you and others but will the promise of digital scholarship be fully realized how will yesterdays norms adapt to tomorrows possibilities this website will help you understand the changing landscape and how it affects you and your research it also offers practical ways to look out for your own interests as a researcher a scholarly revolution is underway it enables you to get a greater return from your research all you have to do is share it
765609 why is the adoption of open access not proceeding even faster than its already heady pace perhaps from my side of the fence where all things open access appear logical and highly desirable i simply cant comprehend why others might not agree part of me wonders though if apathy doesnt play a part

765615 between 1970 and 2005 16 of the most influential medical journals had 118 editors in chief a study of sex equality in biomedical publishing found that only eight of them were women the same journals had 3237 editorial board members 371 of whom were women equality has improved over the years 16 of editorial board members were female in 2005 up from 1 4 in 1970 but men still hold the lions share of the power eleven of the 16 journals studied including the bmj had no female editors during the 35 year study period the authors found that general medical journals from the uk and canada appointed significantly more women to their editorial boards 29 107 27 than similar journals from the us 6 50 12 although these figures are just a snapshot of five journals in the year 2000 so they should be treated with caution does it matter if senior positions at biomedical journals are top heavy with men at least one prominent female editor thinks so sex biased editorial boards means sex biased journal content she writes in a linked editorial and a skewed influence on the wider community journals should start by encouraging women reviewers and making sure they are considered alongside men for a place on the editorial board alison tonk bmj arch intern med 2008 168 544 8

765618 from this brief exercise it is clear that although errami and garner have made progress in a worthwhile cause their efforts have not achieved their intended purpose and despite their words of caution regarding the utility of their database the surprisingly high number of false positives is alarming
765619 physicians have an obligation to be skeptical consumers of research especially as they make care decisions based on the findings
765620 university of tokyo researchers lied about gaining the approval of an ethics review board and conducted studies without donors consent for several articles published in medical journals officials admitted friday
765621 the objective was to investigate whether it is justified to discourage trials with less than 80 power trials with low power are unlikely to produce conclusive results but their findings can be used by pooling then in a meta analysis however such an analysis may be biased because trials with low power are likely to have a nonsignificant result and are less likely to be published than trials with a statistically significant outcome the impact of publication bias does not warrant the exclusion of trials with 50 power
765622 graphical displays of results allow researchers to summarise and communicate the key findings of their study diagnostic information should be presented in an easily interpretable way which conveys both test characteristics diagnostic accuracy and the potential for use in clinical practice predictive value graphical displays are currently underused in primary diagnostic accuracy studies and systematic reviews of such studies work is required to improve graphical displays to better communicate the utility of a test in clinical practice and the implications of test results for individual patients
765623 even academics are influenced by media coverage a seminal paper from the new england journal of medicine in 1991 said that if a study was covered by the new york times it was significantly more likely to be cited by other academic papers but for three months large parts of the nyt went on strike the journalists wrote stories about academic research which never saw the light of day the research saw no increase in citations people read newspapers despite everything we think we know their contents seep in we believe them to be true and we act upon them

765626 there has been an interesting discussion going on at the message board for editors of plos one
765627 a knol is an authoritative article about a specific topic so by its own assertion right at the top of the knol page knols are about authority but theyve made an interesting choice which is to attach authority to authorship this is a model that we understand quite well since it is the classic britannica model so if you want to organise knowledge this way its quite easy you get learned persons to write articles in their areas of expertise there are however multiple problems with this approach so google has created an odd hybrid system its seeded with some articles mostly from medicine but its open to anyone a system that claims authoritativeness with no mechanism to verify this other than a weak name verification procedure
765628 quantifying the relative performance of individual scholars groups of scholars departments institutions provinces states regions and countries has become an integral part of decision making over research policy funding allocations awarding of grants faculty hirings and claims for promotion and tenure bibliometric indices based mainly upon citation counts such as the h index and the journal impact factor are heavily relied upon in such assessments there is a growing consensus and a deep concern that these indices more and more often used as a replacement for the informed judgement of peers are misunderstood and are therefore often misinterpreted and misused the articles in this esep theme section present a range of perspectives on these issues alternative approaches tools and metrics that will hopefully lead to a more balanced role for these instruments are presented
765629 the rise of bioinformatics has focused attention on the growing depth and scope of database content however it is difficult or impossible given the existing citation metrics system to identify who originally created or added value to a datum without a system to reward we shall continue to rely on the good will or spare time of researchers to mobilize data into the public domain

765674 i did ask him to reconsider and it came back immediately with no this is what he wants you to do
765675 when i got here i found out that things were worse than i had feared
765676 there are still major issues facing us as a catholic community not just the state of our schools and our hospitals but how will we have viable vibrant parishes with the decreasing numbers of priests and the sense of alienation among people who were baptized catholics those are huge challenges facing us
765677 but when i think about where we were as a community five years ago and where we are now things are much calmer and theres a sense of direction at the leadership level of the archdiocese
765678 theyve been very challenging times but i think that there has been motion forward
765679 if i had my druthers i would prefer to be living in greater simplicity
765680 i see the bishops role as being a pastor more than being a celebrity and i suppose thats what im uncomfortable with
765681 he clearly was surprised by the degree of public scrutiny of the church that went on here
765682 he reversed eight to 10 decisions and got a lot of criticism from some insiders on it but he did it
765683 he has an extraordinary understanding of and appreciation for symbolism and clearly worked hard in the early days to establish a positive image but where the rubber really meets the road hes almost no different than any of his colleagues
765684 at times i ask god to call me home and let someone else finish this job
765685 being archbishop of boston is like living in a fishbowl made out of magnifying glass
765686 certainly in the last five years there have been darker moments

765688 you get 10 sentences out of him now instead of five
765689 hes a very quiet guy but his few words that are spoken mean something
765690 theres no question that when i was first introduced to him the three wise men were still there and they werent signing up for any galas that i was running
765691 in the beginning i was very concerned about what he was doing he wasnt calling and the people around him thought they could do anything because they were the church
765692 but he has grown more into the job than people expected hes more willing to listen to sit down with different groups in the city and hes telling people what hes going to do before it happens we dont always agree but we have conversation its my religion its his religion and we want to make the city work
765693 i was born and baptized and bred in a pretty staunch catholic upbringing
765694 its when you get into conversations with mom and you ask why is the sky blue
765695 i asked whats going to happen to howie goldstein when he dies

765730 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
765731 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
765732 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
765733 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
765734 south korea is a leading testbed for the it industry and the internet media here certainly has a frontier like aspect in leading experimental democracy
765735 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information

765794 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
765795 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
765796 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
765797 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
765798 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest

765810 we underestimated the number of firewalls out there that were deployed in front of dns servers
765811 cisco juniper citrix and a number of other firewall vendors have been absolutely scrambling to update their equipment
765812 if you have a pat firewall the best thing you can do is look through our document understand how our network is configured and if you need the fix thats provided then install the fix
765813 but at least there are no more deniers out there muddying the waters with the overblown not urgent message
765814 today were in the process of bringing all our student e mail accounts into google education and giving them access to the google apps
765815 for the present time we are not doing that with faculty and staff accounts but that may still happen in the future
765816 so the google relationship provides us with a very cost effective method of extending services to students
765817 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
765818 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
765819 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
765820 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as youtube so its only fair that we finally get native browser support for videos

765824 by that i didnt necessarily mean make yourself anonymous when designing something you have to consider and then decide which factors are most important to your final product
765825 the design will materialize as you begin to work with the factors youve decided are most important but a designer who then adds something for the sake of expressing the self is letting his ego get the best of him theres no reason for the extra curve and yet its there to signify this is a signature item
765826 creating a distinctive feel and not just an eye catching look is a wise design strategy
765827 theres so much focus on big i innovation as in the game changers the category killers the disruptive tech these days
765828 i think fukasawa makes a big case for the power of little i or quiet innovation

765831 in trying to meet the needs of all students they meet the needs of few
765832 the need for synchronization has subtle but devastating effects on learning
765833 as a teacher i was reminded annually that my primary goal was to judge and sort students rather than educate them
765834 learning comes from doing whether it involves performing an experiment or reading a book yet we sit students down for a dozen years talk at them and then expect them to be literate independent thinkers
765835 our methodology is inductive and case based our objective is to advance general theoretical understanding of work and management approaches that repeatedly generate valuable novelty and to relate the emerging theory to theoretical constructs in adjacent areas of research such as business innovation the psychology of individual creativity and the social psychology of creativity we find numerous categories of commonality that transcend fields of application

765846 knowing what students know the science and design of educational assessment
765847 assessments need to examine how well students engage in communicative practices appropriate to a domain of knowledge and skill what they understand about those practices and how well they use the tools appropriate to that domain
765848 the only way students gain access to the standpoint that enables practitioners to act meaningfully and purposefully
765849 for example a student that has the highest percentage of his her clicks on market share data relative to breakeven profits competitor pricing etc could be inferred to have a strong competition orientation similarly a person that looks primarily at the capacity utilization information might be more of a cost pricer
765850 getting one person to be able to play all the roles entailed by authentic activity and to reflect productively upon his or her performance is one of the monumental tasks of education
765851 systems that assess components of students knowledge while they are working on problems on line when a student makes a mistake the system provides advice and remediation to correct the error studies suggest that when individuals work with these tutors there is a relatively direct relationship between the assessment of student learning and the research based model of student thinking on average students learn more with the system than with traditional instruction koedinger and anderson 1999
765852 educational environments designed from a pfl perspective emphasize the importance of encouraging attitudes and habits of mind that prepare people to resist making old responses by simply assimilating new info to their existing concepts or schemas instead effective learners learn to look critically at their current knowledge and beliefs
765853 where the puck will be not where it is now
765854 to understand the behavior of people in challenging situations it is critical to understand what is the conceptual map that the leaders sees and then what is their strategy for identifying a destination

765864 to improve the practice of management and its impact in a changing world
765865 advocate a model of teachers as participant observers who model and display their thinking processes in public dialogue a classroom culture that accepts the voicing of uncertainty standards of evaluation that are co constructed by teachers and students and classes in which knowledge is created not through conflict but consensus

766069 youve sniffed more than one cork youve decanted more than one five dollar bottle of wine youve kept a wine diary and what about that tacky wicker basket you purchased allegedly designed to rest the wine
766070 i havent used that for years its buried somewhere in my wine closet
766071 you sir is what is commonly known as a wine snob
766072 is one who attempts to impress others with his knowledge of wine but is really more impressed with himself
766073 but thats not what i came here to talk about
766074 you are small pickings compared to the current crop of wine snobs around today
766075 are bad architect and bad poetry but to me nothing is more offensive than purple language about wine
766076 any wine is nothing more than fermented crushed grapes of course beyond that it is my job to add the mystique that makes wine much more than fermented crushed grapes and i have been doing that quite well for ages without any help
766077 then this bunch comes in with their red and black currents crushed stones new saddle leather layers of violet tobacco and a dash of coffee
766078 that wine at least my idea of wine is made from grapes not gooseberries
766079 i never paid any attention to those critics you cant accuse me of that bad as i have been i have never polluted my wine vocabulary with that stuff you never heard me talk about the ever popular pencil whiff of game
766080 i have chosen you to renounce your snobbery and help bring wine back to earth where it belongs
766081 im just a guy who drinks a lot of wine why me
766082 what credentials do these wine critics have who selected them as authorities certainly not me
766083 as far as im concerned you have the most important credential
766084 according to what i have seen you have more experience with french wine you lived in paris for four years in the nineteen seventies you went to just about every three star restaurant you speak french albeit badly you even owned a farmhouse in cotes du rhone
766085 and while i was in france i had everything from a 1918 haut bailly to 51 bonnes mare and
766086 none of that matters to anybody but you besides you should know the first great truth about wine whether its wine of the gods or the stuff that mortals drink its always a matter of taste your taste whoever you are
766087 the important thing is that you have a bottle of wine on your table just about every night and as your lovely wife sara is constantly reminding you you know so much and yet so little youre a perfect messenger for me
766088 those critics are published in ostentatious magazines with big circulations theyre always quoted people actually believe in their numbers game with the ratings who will listen to me
766089 i will be guiding you to the truth even when its right in front of your eyes or under your nose now i have to go

766191 dopo 4 giorni dal ricevimento dellesito delle indagine il 4 febbraio 1994
766192 tale modalit operativa mi riporta alla mente quanto purtroppo gi accaduto anche a me e paolo avvelenamento e sabotaggi alla moto vedi articoli di questo blog del 03 novembre 2007 e del 03 aprile 2008 il sistema sempre lo stesso

766204 metromix wanted to do a weekly comics series so editor in chief deborah vankin helped put this together
766205 the only mandate they gave us was that the story should appeal to southern california hipsters and be set in los angeles
766206 metromix wanted its debut to coincide with comic con and gave us the cover story for that issue so we had to spin on a dime and make it happen
766207 we developed the story came up with a treatment story arcs got approvals and had it ready for the july 23 issue its a unique opportunity and its closer to the japanese system of publishing where its serialized weekly instead of coming out as a complete graphic novel
766208 they live in los angeles and are very l a savvy we thought theyd be perfect team for this project
766209 jason brought us on because he knew we could count on us to get it done
766210 this is our first time doing a weekly one page feature
766211 the challenge is that it has to stand on its own as a single page as well as a part of a complete story we have to be brief but each page has to have a beginning a middle and an end its also tricky to appeal to both the l a crowd and manga readers
766212 this project has been an equal partnership with jason christina elmer and myself and its been really fun

766219 the youth team midfielder will therefore play in the football league championship next season where he will continue progressing and honing his skills
766220 he arrived for a trial as we were beginning our pre season training at the end of the three days the trial was conclusive but day in day out he astonishes us because we did not expect a player who came for a trial to be so strong
766221 it is good because i think that we have succeeded in making a good deal sometimes we can spend hundreds of thousands on a player and there having come for a trial was a player who could be very important to us considering his services in the friendlies against lyon and roma i think that he will be made good
766222 i think we have a good youth system which is very important to ajax but its been like this for the last 25 years
766223 its important to keep players for as long as possible maybe with money maybe with other promises

766225 he is a young player who can have a fine future with saint tienne if a transfer is not completed this year then it will be done next year the basic idea it is that he will arrive at the end of his contract which expires at the end of next season
766226 he is a 2 year old international player who could arrive on a free transfer so we are positioning ourselves quickly if lille prefer a little money this summer rather than nothing next year it will be an opportunity for us to sign k vin more quickly

766263 our agency group has been having the ongoing discussion about how much is too much in open adoption
766264 its fine that you feel that way but you dont get to say that about the other person in front of firefly not yet
766265 part of settling into my role as an open adoption parent has been releasing what i cant control and embracing what i can

766271 there is the danger of futility the belief there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the worlds ills against misery and ignorance injustice and violence yet many of the worlds greatest movements of thought and action have flowed from the work of a single person few will have the greatness to bend history itself but each of us can work to change a small portion of events and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation it is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped each time a person stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he or she sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance

766300 when the poor acquire the status of an epistemological primum
766301 what happens to the faith and its doctrine on the theological and pastoral level the inevitable result is the politicization of the faith its reduction to an instrument for social liberation
766302 it is not true that liberation theology replaces god and christ with the poor it was christ who wanted to identify himself with the poor the place of the poor is a privileged place of encounter with the lord those who encounter the poor inevitably encounter christ still in his crucified form asking to be taken down from the cross and brought back to life

766313 w hat the cross points to is the very thing that seems to stand in the way of realizing who you are
766314 i thought jesus came died on the cross that jesus being here was about his death and dying on the cross when it really was about him coming to show us how to do it how to be to show us the christ consciousness that he had and that that consciousness abides with all of us
766315 the symbolic significance of the cross is changed from being a torture instrument to a symbol of the divine

766345 july 29 2008 council member gregg smith i disagree with your support for increase in trash charges specifically the service was never free it was just not a separately stated charge but service was a cost included in a city budget and taxes already were being collected to address the budget now you are just pulling out this service as a separate component in order to say it is chargeable because other cities consider it a separate item it is something that was included because the budget was managed before not like it is now with spending done on a runaway basis part of why more revenue is being sought to say it was a free service and that charges have been always been imposed by other cities for trash collection doesnt validate this just because it was not separated doesn t mean it was not included in the budget considerations for city expenses for services shaping the terms as you want to essentially shifting blame for creation of this separate fee is simply disingenuous we were not spoiled you council members and your predecessors responsible as the fiscal caretakers and although done over time it was not handled well to the detriment of the public the metered trash concept is with its own problems maybe different ones you will have people dumping trash in other s containers or in street trash containers as some small businesses do when they don t want to pay fees on their own to anyone the recycle bins don t receive compliance with contents deposited because some people don t understand written english or spanish even if they speak it and among all the residents some just don t care anyway the passing scavengers if a violation for illegal conduct is to be enforced need to be given warnings and then cited fairly and consistently if there is any money to be gained by recycling for the city if council would act honestly the reception might be different the stacking of charges is happening too fast for lots of people impacting heavily on people like retirees and handicapped and other very low income people the needs of the city don t ever consider the negative impact of unbridled immigration that enticement by city policies foster and so you don t even enforce housing code violations caused by over occupancy among other things affecting infrastructure i suspect if cash could be found in high enough numbers enforcement would follow and at an expedited rate please listen to the people who take time to travel to city hall for only 2 minutes of time while council shows them rudeness in behavior and then runs the measures through anyway the presentations by council to justify imposition of the increases were simply taking advantage of their superior position to the public there is no rebuttal offered due to public s inability to challenge assumptions theories and conclusions drawn by the council in the end the outcome just looks like a predetermined outcome

766432 il calo dei consumi ce ma il 7 in meno di iva tenuto conto dellinflazione al 4 significherebbe oltre il 10 in meno di consumi un dato assolutamente irrealistico si tratta dunque di evasione
766433 la sinistra farebbe meglio a tacere punta il dito nei loro disastrosi anni di governo hanno tassato tutto e tutti hanno penalizzato le fasce piu deboli hanno tartassato i precari hanno umiliato il territorio noi tuteliamo i piu deboli e chiediamo soldi solo ai petrolieri che fanno profitti
766434 unoperazione difficilissima che nessun governo e mai riuscito a fare e che e un modo per non aumentare le tasse
766435 un ministro che bussa alla porta di giulio tremonti per chiedere favori o per implorare un trattamento di clemenza nei tagli da effettuare
766436 tutti dovranno fare sacrifici ma di certo il governo non mettera le mani nelle tasche degli italiani
766437 agire come lamministratore di un grande condominio dividendo i tagli in millesimi in proporzione assegnati a ciascun ministero
766438 perche sia sancita la specificita del comparto difesa e sicurezza che ha un ruolo specifico e va distinto dal resto del pubblico impiego visto che i nostri uomini fanno un lavoro assai piu rischioso e assai meno pagato
766439 le tensioni tra ministri evidenziano tutti i limiti e le contraddizioni di una manovra economica che non aiuta le famiglie e non aggredisce i nodi strutturali della pesante crisi economica italiana
766440 e un massacro sociale che avviene nel silenzio piu assoluto
766441 but its a lot of fun were enjoying every minute of what we do the schedule we keep is demanding but its definitely an amazing experience we really enjoy going on the road as much we are able to
766442 i think for us since were there from the beginning with the writing of the songs through the production it just becomes a different experience
766443 this music really is us its not like a manufactured version
766444 its definitely not a completely different change by any means
766445 but this record was definitely inspired by some of the artists we look up to like some prince and elvis costello influences and a little piece of funk getting into some songs
766446 its a whole new production and of course its going to be outside in amphitheaters and so it will have a summer vibe and we cant wait for everyone to come out
766447 but i have over time understood just how bad they are for you and have cut them all but out of my diet

766453 yes but we also have a ten case minimum but for a same day delivery you have to have your order placed by 11am

766590 it seems that the tree in my yard is dying
766591 and i was wondering if you wouldnt mind taking a look at it
766592 your tree is dying because of this cut which continues to bleed at its base because a branch was cut off at the trees foundation and not sealed over properly the bleeding sap is keeping the nutrients from going up the trees trunck and reaching the rest of the tree as a result one side of the tree where the cut was inflicted and not covered over has begun to die
766593 how long should the healing process take for something like this
766594 when does a person start to become either bitter or better from it

766918 dat betekent in overeenstemming met de zon want dat is onze belangrijkste kracht die voedt alles volgens de vedische leer bouw je de keuken daarom richting de zon want voor koken heb je energie nodig de slaapkamer ligt juist in de schaduw anders word je maar duf
766919 hiermee kunnen we de sterren bestuderen blijkt uit de sterren dat er ergens oorlog wordt verwacht dan kunnen wij dat op subtiele manier voorkomen wij zijn een soort wasmachine die alle negativiteit uit de wereld wast
766920 het bewustzijn van een individu maar ook van een land kan gespannen zijn wij verminderen die spanning door te mediteren zie het als een druppel koud water dat je over kokend water sprenkelt het kokende water wordt dan even rustig het ontspant
766921 om de spanning van een ander te verminderen moet je eerst zelf volledig in evenwicht zijn dat kost vele jaren studie en meditatie je moet op zoek naar de bron in jezelf want daar vind je oneindige stilte oneindige energie oneindige intelligentie en oneindig geluk en geluk is vrede dus heb je dat eenmaal gevonden dan begin je dat steeds meer naar anderen uit te stralen
766922 daar wordt aan gewerkt in india moeten we volgend jaar twintigduizend professionals permanent bij elkaar hebben gebracht dan hebben we een safetyfactor en in nederland dat aan vierhonderd mensen voldoende heeft gaat het al heel redelijk naast vlodrop waar zon driehonderd mensen permanent mediteren wordt ook elders flink gemediteerd dat heft het feit dat we niet allemaal bij elkaar zitten weer op

766952 im very thrilled about him coming back i think its great
766953 i think he should stand by his word he said he was retiring the team drafted two good quarterbacks this year as a result and i think he should stick by that
766954 he should take a back seat to aaron rodgers i think aaron deserves work hard for and he waited all these years and brett said hes going to retire

766975 george siemens online book knowing knowledge is fun to read its laid out like a tom peters book full of graphics and different type fonts and some wonderful quotations it has a kind of stream of consciousness style thats a bit mcluhanesque its playful although his prescription is i think impractical his vision of an organization that enables effective knowledge sharing learning and collaboration is worth thinking about
766976 although the ideas were familiar to me in principle i still had difficulty reading the book with aim of reviewing it this is exactly because siemens rejects the conventional design of a book as a knowledge product and as a linearly structured story with the aim to sway the reader the book is much more of an invitation to have fun browsing to jump from section to section as if it were hypertext and to return to it regularly
766977 on the one hand i agree with his observations about the changing nature of the world the significance of networks and so on but i also feel rather uneasy about his point that the know where and the know who are more important today than the what and the how

766988 the question is why does lionsgate want the movie to make less money than it would normally in limited theaters something seems off
766989 its pretty damn obvious to me you arent settling into city living you get an unexpected visitor and youre practically crawling out of your skin
766990 you can tell me about it on the plane get your stuff together
766991 at its simplest information is a node which can be connected when connected it becomes knowledge i e it possesses some type of context and is situated in dave sabol
766992 but if knowledge is non representational then what is it saying that its some physical thing like a connection is about as useful as saying that it is a brick
766993 to put this bluntly is understanding an epistemological state that is it it some kind of super knowledge perhaps context aware knowledge kind of like wisdom or is it a perceptual state is understanding what it feels like to know is any emergent property of a network an understanding
766994 i dont mean to be antagonistic here i am sympathetic with the intent of this post but it is so far from being an adequate account of these terms it was almost a duty a responsibility that i post this correction
766995 connections are knowledge but understanding is a lot more than multiple connections understanding is also about having some reality and affinity with something try to say that you understand something with you dont have any affinity

767041 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges

767044 consumer spending is being supported by credit for consumption purposes which rose over the year by 7 6 per cent in may
767045 nevertheless anecdotal evidence showed that demand for labour remains positive so far this year consistent with the economic recovery
767046 this is weird but i i think i i think i saw some stuff
767047 look at it this way wally this may have been the most amazing experience of your life and im not joking
767048 i know what you must be thinking right now and god knows i had my doubts about bringing you here
767049 think of it as think of it as like a kind of therapy thats what i try to do look wally i know what you think about me about how great my life is but well to tell you the truth after my mid twenties things kind of went downhill for me i was at the end of my rope when i left san francisco ten years ago that city s not what it used to be you know there was a window of time a very small window when it seemed like something truly amazing was about to happen there it was a burst of potential subversive even but hell i dont know i was such an arrogant bastard
767050 what you ve had is still better than my life at least you had something at least you had a wife for a while you know someone to be with and now you have money i never had anything not even a girlfriend do you know susan never really talked to me after that trip to big sur and i actually thought it was because she was freaked out about having slept with me i loved the memory of that night now i know it didnt mean anything i never had anything and all i have now is a disability check and a head injury
767051 but strangely enough a head injury is exactly what i had in mind for myself i had already bought the gun and had it ready i was going to drive out to the ventana wilderness park in the parking lot and then just walk off trail until i found the right spot to blow my fucking brains out i stopped at a bar to get a drink before i did it thats where i met the guy who owns this trailer i had lost all hope in the world until that day
767052 susan and i never never made love it was all in my head
767053 i was a pain in all of your asses and you wished i never came
767054 listen wally i know you probably think im a piece of shit right now and youre right im a horrible person but you know when you started having fainting spells i couldnt sleep for weeks i kept thinking what if i had taken you to the hospital maybe by not taking you i wrecked your health what if you had permanent brain damage it would be all my fault i felt horrible about it if that means anything to you
767055 what happened just now that thing was it really an alien and did i did we really have i mean and why
767056 give me a call maybe eventually well get to understand it better this is real wally this is part of the world that humanity has never encountered before its here right now for us not some magical person that was gifted with everything in some magical time thats gone
767057 hi wally isnt it san francisco state i think youre in my history class
767058 oh well groovy well hey i was just going down to the beach to meet some friends ill let you get along your way see you in class huh
767059 im not really doing much of anything today i was just walking around mind if i join you
767060 im really feeling like this is where im meant to be im getting more and more sure about it this new movement is so freeing isnt it
767061 i was talking to my friends here about our learned professor just the other day what do you think of him
767062 dont you think hes just a little bit fascist have you noticed the way he talks about the reds like were witnessing the return of the black plague hes like joe mccarthy in a ratty suit that smells like piss and mothballs
767063 i guess he smells pretty bad hes really boring too
767064 i can never pay attention in that class i keep almost falling asleep
767065 well there you have it i guess but hey whats going on with you gary dont you have something youd like to share with us
767066 dont keep us waiting too come on get out a match already
767067 what do you think wally tell me are you shocked are you going to turn us in or do you actually smoke grass all the time
767068 you shouldnt be from your perspective right now it may seem new and scary but from our perspective youre like a monkey or an ape and were like supermen you can be a superman too wally anyone can just give yourself a fighting chance
767069 come on jim dont be like that youre freaking him out more its not that big a deal wally
767070 and ill take a sip of that wine too while im at it why not
767071 wow nice to meet you youre great i cant believe it here i am drinking in public and hanging out with grass fiends
767072 ive only been here a month and im getting morally corrupted already
767073 thats exciting well im not doing anything this weekend if you have room for one more
767074 they look just like amanita jim says amanita is magical
767075 come on lets go show him back at the clearing jim was standing in a sea of canvas patiently putting together a pile of metal rods when the rod got to be a certain length he would set it on the ground and then it would immediately fall apart then he would pick it back up and put it back together i ll do the tents said gary the girls have a mushroom question show me said jim susan walked up to jim and presented him with a mushroom on her palm he took it and studied it carefully hmm well it does look good where did you find it there was a grassy spot about ten minutes away the mushrooms were just growing there in the grass hmm
767076 so pretty said susan dancing around on tip toes with joy and picking a broken off cap out of her pocket oh this is exciting should we eat them now or later
767077 lets eat them after it gets dark said cindy you should go take a look at where they were growing said gary behind him don t they usually grow on cow shit or something of course i should look at them growing wild myself before i made the final decision said jim scratching his head you can t be too careful about this kind of thing you know there are other species that look similar to aminta and i wouldnt want us to be confused gary s right as a respected mycologist i wouldnt want to be responsible for our untimely deaths where are the rest of them susan looked put out i don t know i just picked them all she opened her pocket and showed jim the rest there werent any more anywhere in the area i know where they were said cindy i left a big scuff mark in the ground where i jumped up and down when we saw them well then m lady would you care to join me on an expedition asked jim he held out his hand yeah let s go said cindy don t worry susan we ll find more back in a sec
767078 the tentsll be up by the time you get back
767079 is that what a magic mushroom looks like he asked
767080 wow thats neat have you ever eaten magic mushrooms before
767081 gary come on gary you better finish those tents quick let s eat these mushrooms and go lay down in the clover
767082 jim isnt ever going to say it s safe now he isn t ever going to find any more i picked the only ones in the whole field and now we won t get to eat any oh i wish you werent so paranoid sometimes he said they were amanita
767083 i dont know i dont think any really poisonous mushrooms even grow around here at least i never heard of any i guess wed have to go get our stomachs pumped or something why
767084 well at least now we ll know what they do i guess she took another mushroom out of her pocket and started playing with it in the same way she had played with the other mushroom
767085 shit shit shit shit shit shit wally was sprawled out on his back arms splayed eyes open but glazed his lips were pursed his teeth were clenched and he was breathing laboriously through them little drops of spittle flying out of his mouth once and a while he would make a horrible cry and flop his arms up and down in a violent but pointless motion oh fuck
767086 you know i think he s going to be ok right here where we are
767087 i think what he really needs is just a little time to sleep it off
767088 id feel weird just leaving him like this what if he really is dying
767089 wed have to drive a pretty long way to get ot the nearest hospital
767090 if hes really dying itd probably be too late by then then wed have to drive back out in the dark or stay in carmel or someplace in a hotel
767091 it doesnt have to be a bad time we have some hotdogs buns and two bottles of whiskey lets set it up i could use a drink right now actually
767092 youre right he does look a lot better well watch him ok all a hospital would do is pump his stomach anyway and he did that himself already i guess
767093 wally you re awake how are you how are you feeling
767094 i dont remember anything that happened last night at all was i tripping
767095 yeah you were tripping yeah things were pretty crazy last night
767096 i couldnt regret anything that could have helped me to be here right now with you
767097 ive just discovered something ive just found something i want to show you
767098 because i sure as hell am the universe is a weird weird place wally space its vast
767099 well okay see you sunday oh and wally i m sorry really i am i hope i see you soon and that s the truth

767101 i thought they served microbrew at this place or something
767102 well they do i guess but that stuffs too damn expensive and i dont think its any good anyway
767103 well i might get myself one of those pints of miller too now that i see you have one i got pretty thirsty out there and i have a headache too do you want another one i feel like i should get you something for waiting
767104 you know nothing special i have a little one bedroom unit all to myself which is nice health problems a little bit but nothing too serious
767105 hey baby i just have a lot of free time thats all is that so wrong this is my old friend wally from college in san francisco weve known each other for a long long time we came down here years ago before this restaurant was even built and probably before you were even born

767111 congratulations i dont think ive seen you since you got your inheritance hows life been for you now that youre a millionaire
767112 but theres also still a lot of undeveloped nature and it has its other advantages
767113 is there well im looking forward to seeing whatever it is you wanted to show me
767114 oh ill just have a special mel hamburger with sweet pickle sauce
767115 the picture on the menu makes it look so good
767116 it comes with a side of salad what kind of dressing would you like we have raspberry vinaigrette garlic tahini creamy cilantro and ranch
767117 so what is this thing that you wanted to show me i have to say im curious that message on my phone really left me guessing ive been wondering about it all week i mean we havent really been in touch the last few years so it was kind of a surprise to hear from you what was all that about the universe you sounded pretty excited about it whatever it was oh and don t be sorry about not calling me sooner if thats what you were apologizing for i know we haven t been in the best touch lately but it s partly my fault too i was putting in a lot of overtime at my job so i never had much time to come into the city anyway its ok but this is going to be the sexy stuff right what is it you can tell me
767118 well its not something that i can really describe its more like something youre going to have to see for yourself we can go there when youre done eating
767119 we can go anytime day or night of course it all depends on when you want to get back home i dont have anything else to do
767120 oh i dont really have anything to get back to
767121 i havent been working lately im out on disability right now actually i was working for the san jose dmv but about a month ago i fell hit my head on a desk and got a concussion ive been feeling better recently but im still recovering
767122 well ive been managing okay the only thing is that ive been having headaches lately my fainting spells have come back too you remember my fainting spells don t you they started right after our trip to big sur anyway they didnt happen for a long time and then all of a sudden bam thats actually why i was late i fainted while i was on my way over here on the road i had to sit in my car until i felt okay to drive again and then i had to drive slow nerves i guess im sorry
767123 and you still came in and ordered yourself a beer and a hamburger are you suicidal you should be at home right now and not out driving around on the road
767124 wally i want to be honest with you to get to the place were going were going to be driving down some rough unpaved roads and then well have to walk up a trail through the woods and then when we get there well its definitely going to be physical are you sure youre up for it
767125 but i cant let you drive you can ride with me in my truck
767126 you can take me back to my truck later and i can drive myself home
767127 to my surprise what i found most interesting about vespers was its construction its success at arranging events and making characters take action it has a lot of plot but avoids the excessively linear feel of many high plot content games the way it works is mostly neat sleight of hand
767128 and do you have to sleep or did you teach yourself the way you taught yourself to breathe

767438 i can leave the village when ever i want and i dont need the elders permission to do so
767439 no needs to get angry it was just a question back in my day the hyugas where much more conservative then now never letting the main family leave without a dozen or so guards and especially never let the heirs out of their sight but seems they relaxed their laws a bit by the way how is old herioshi
767440 oh such a pity then now hiashi is the head of the family how is the old rebellious prankster
767441 sure your father raised quite a few eyebrows with his pranks even a scandal or two in his teens but once he reached his 20s he became more mature and after your mother died well he became a cold and calculating bastard like the rest of his clan no offence meant
767442 none taken but what was my father like back then
767443 oh he was an incredibly good prankster his pranks where known far and wide everybody knew it was him but there just wasnt anyway to prove it he always had an alibi on top of that he disobeyed and held no respect to clan laws or the elders he even married without the approval of the elders and nearly lost his title as heir to the clan more then once but now hes just as bad as the elders by the way i havent told you my name yet i am geu leu but everyone calls me grandfather or grandpapi

767458 corruption in our country has become a way of life for a huge number of people
767459 those who take bribes feel it involves no risks or consider such risks as negligible
767460 others are simply involved in lobbyism or feeding off it
767461 its much more difficult to extort bribes on the internet
767462 different people told me why are you doing that it will lead you nowhere
767463 yes its a very difficult problem but doing nothing at all will be even worse dealing with that is a matter of honor for the government

767474 chinese authorities on saturday denied claims by a uighur separatist group that it was behind deadly bus bombings in two cities state media reported
767475 we have noticed media reports about the claims but so far no evidence has been found to indicate the explosions were connected with terrorists and their attacks or with the beijing olympics
767476 the may 5 blast was indeed deliberate but had nothing to do with terrorist attacks
767477 through this blessed jihad holy war in yunnan this time the turkestan islamic party warns china one more time
767478 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed
767479 there were no terrorist attacks on july 17 in guangdong
767480 we will continue to keep a close watch over the social situation in xinjiang and strive to ensure olympic security
767481 we have dispatched hundreds of police officers who can speak uighur ethnic language to major cities in other provinces this year to assist in ensuring local social stability
767482 there are a number of terrorist groups seeking to attack china at this point in time but the group with the intentions and capability to mount attacks in china is etim
767483 its impossible for a terrorist group to do a big attack in china because the chinese have taken many security measures but its very likely there will be small and medium attacks in the lead up during and after the olympics
767484 china wants to prove there is terrorism in xinjiang to continue to repress uighurs in the region

767494 general zhomart mazhrenov spent more than 25 years in the service of the soviet kgb then kazakhstans national security committee knb
767495 but in recent years in connection to rakhat aliev and musaev somehow he mazhrenov got involved with rakhat and you know about him and his illegal activities and musaev and mazhrenov and other coup plotters were brought down
767496 he was a person with a strong will its hard to believe
767497 usually people with a weak character commit suicide but of course on the other hand a person who worked their whole life in the national security committee he had the post of general to be arrested it is a great disgrace for his family his friends and for those worked with him of course it is a huge shock so i cannot exclude that someone would be driven to such an extreme act
767498 it would be almost impossible because there is such surveillance of prisoners that it is practically impossible and especially since according to regulations there is not only one person in a cell but a minimum of two

767601 jen people like the hamiltons are used to getting whatever they want peters not responding to their wants fast enough so theyre looking for explanations
767602 if theyd just talk to peter theyd learn who he is instead they order him around as if he were a child hes not a child daddy
767603 growing up is hard for a child but believe it or not its even harder for parents to let go
767604 hes so stubborn he doesnt care about me im just his trophy child someone he can point to and claim as his progeny with the great hamilton fortune ive tried jen ive done what youve asked but he wont even listen to me
767605 dont say something in the heat of anger that youll regret later

767627 that pendant is worth ten thousand dollars and thats just the petty cash
767628 you two are crazy you dont know your son at all ive spent hours and hours defending you to him telling him to give you a chance to just try and meet you halfway hes at oxford because i convinced him to stick it out hes staying here in this house with you because i told him he belonged at home even though my parents had told him he could stay with us if he wanted he kept telling me you didnt care about him i just i couldnt believe it you really dont care about him
767629 he only ever wanted to be loved and your throwing that away
767630 and you can take your blank check and stuff it
767631 if you ever come near my daughter again you wont take another breath
767632 you just did what weve been unable to do for years get jen to admit shes in love with your son

767641 you heard me im leaving and if you ever want to see me again you wont bother jennifer or her family again
767642 im suggesting we do whatever it takes to free our son of that albatross once and for all
767643 when we got there you were pretty much the one talking
767644 i mean what i said about a about how i
767645 it means trusting someone forever it also means compromise and being able to forgive
767646 sweetie are you sure you really forgave peter for hurting you that night
767647 jen there are layers to forgiveness sometimes it takes a while to get through all of them
767648 im sorry i dont know what they said but i have good idea jen i walked out and im not going back i dont care what you say being my parents doesnt give them the right to control me or treat you the way they did
767649 i know you dont want me to say it but i have to if you tell me to leave i will but if you dont im going to say it
767650 jen i love you im in love with you and i want us to be together forever just like your dad and daddy are
767651 im in love with you too peter i i love you
767652 im so sorry i was scared i peter i was afraid of being hurt again i didnt even realize it until daddy said it a few minutes ago hes right i never forgave you not all the way i thought i had but i hadnt i was just so afraid
767653 i will never hurt you again jen when i saw you walk away that night when i saw you get into doctor car your head held high i knew id made the biggest mistake of my life i fell head over heels in love with you right then but it was too late
767654 i love you jen i promise ill never hurt you

767659 anyway babe it made sense with jen shes worked so hard to keep the truth buried there had to be a reason and there was only one real reason that made sense
767660 the hamiltons brought about the one thing they didnt want the most

767796 la sola espressione dissidente in israele tra il 1967 ed il 1973 periodo di euforia e di spensieratezza nel paese
767797 dopo la guerra del libano era visto di buon occhio essere di sinistra
767798 il bisogno dinformare i palestinesi su ci che accade in israele e gli israeliani su ci che accade nei territori palestinesi
767799 cara amica il nostro problema qui in quanto israeliani contro loccupazione un problema concreto con i nostri vicini concreti quelli che tornano a casa dopo avere prestato servizio ai blocchi stradali e avere trattato esseri umani come animali diventano fascisti attraverso la pratica ossia attraverso il servizio militare e solo poi fascisti ideologicamente questo non preoccupa la sinistra filo israeliana in italia tu sostieni che la sinistra italiana non avrebbe trattato un boicottaggio del sudafrica nel modo in cui sta trattando qualunque proposta di boicottaggio di israele ma la cosa pi semplice pensa alla sinistra italiana durante la prima guerra del libano e paragonala alla sua posizione attuale non loccupazione a aver cambiato natura leuropa occidentale che cambiata che tornata al suo vecchio modo di guardare i non europei con odio e disprezzo nellimmaginario della sinistra italiana i palestinesi hanno perso lo status simbolico di cui godevano un tempo la kefia al collo di decine di migliaia di giovani italiani ad esempio e sono passati nellhinterland delleuropa dove gli americani possono fare quello che vogliono e lavida europa come sempre si schiera dalla parte dei pi forti i palestinesi sono ancora una volta solo degli arabi che sanguinano e il sangue arabo proprio come in passato il sangue ebraico vale poco si potrebbe riassumere il cinismo dellattuale scena italiana citando giorgio napolitano quando ha fatto riferimento a una vecchia discussione che ebbe nel 1982 a torino con lallora comunista giuliano ferrara riflettendo sulla posizione del pci sul massacro di sabra e shatila napolitano che sarebbe poi diventato presidente ha detto per quanto riguarda una determinata persona giuliano ferrara ricordo solo che egli si faceva promotore di una causa la causa palestinese nel 1982 che nel partito godeva di una qualche popolarit ma che non ci avvicinava per nulla alla presa del potere machiavelli avrebbe dovuto incontrare sia ferrara che il presidente italiano per un drink sui fiumi di sangue palestinese ma il cambiamento di posizione della sinistra italiana ha molto poco a che vedere con la propaganda israeliana anche se la fiera del libro di torino rientra anchessa nella propaganda israeliana concentriamoci per un momento su questa fiera a titolo di esempio abbiamo a che fare con la cultura che sempre la coesistenza di affari delle case editrici ad esempio con il razzismo implicito degli amanti della cultura cultura che sempre puramente occidentale cristiana o secolare gli israeliani in questo contesto sono gli eredi della buona vecchia europa mentre gli arabi naturalmente non sono ammessi in questa cultura in breve la xenofobia italiana ha anche un volto umano la fiera del libro di torino il nostro stato che da 41 anni sta privando unintera nazione di qualunque diritto se non quello di emigrare viene celebrato dalla cultura bene questa leuropa dopo tutto la stessa europa che noi e i nostri genitori abbiamo conosciuto la cultura sempre stata la cultura dei padroni il dibattito sulla fiera del libro pu dimostrare come la sinistra un tempo la pi sensibile deuropa verso la causa palestinese sia diventata la pi cinica sinistra filo israeliana ha perso il suo orizzonte politico e in questo vuoto ideologico ci che si realmente verificato il ritorno del coloniale questo il contesto storico in cui va letta lestinzione della nazione palestinese celebrata attraverso il 60 anniversario di israele leuropa si sta espandendo fino a includere israele come isola di democrazia di diritti umani non dobbiamo dimenticare che la sinistra italiana non ha mai attraversato un processo post coloniale ha fatto tutta la strada dalla retorica anticolonialista degli anni 70 allattuale ansia coloniale per i nostri fratelli ebrei l nella giungla tra i selvaggi mamma li turchi cara amica non possiamo dipendere dagli europei nonostante pochi coraggiosi guarda i nostri soldati sono tornati a casa e dai loro scarponi il sangue cola in salotto imparano presto nella vita a ignorare le lacrime delle madri prima di compiere ventanni sono gi crudeli come cacciatori di teschi lo ammetto dovevo scrivere questo pezzo per il manifesto ma mi sono rivolto a te perch non riesco pi a rivolgermi agli europei direttamente chiedendo loro di pensare ai palestinesi rinchiusi come animali nei loro ghetti al vento e alla pioggia e gli anni passano
767800 il terzo millennio vedr la nascita di uno stato palestinese la cosiddetta seconda intifada non altro che la guerra dindipendenza palestinese cos come la violenza commessa dallesercito israeliano e dai coloni non che lespressione sanguinaria dellodio coloniale e vendicativo di fronte ad una rivoluzione di cui ben conosciamo gli inevitabili risultati e non la prima volta in mezzo secolo che una forza occupante si rivela sconfitta
767801 uno stato che insiste in unoccupazione militare che commette quotidianamente crimini nei confronti di civili e che pratica lapartheid non merita di essere invitato a manifestazioni culturali di qualunque genere
767802 io penso che ogni intellettuale ogni scrittore debba rifiutare di prendere parte a qualunque riunione celebrativa di un qualsiasi anniversario di israele invece di partecipare a iniziative di questo genere dovrebbero aiutare i palestinesi a riconquistare i loro diritti la loro terra la loro acqua
767803 nonfiction fr lei sicuramente al corrente che israele sar questanno linvitato donore al salon du livre fiera del libro di parigi e nata una polemica sulla selezione ufficiale degli scrittori israeliani qual il dibattito
767804 la fiera del libro di torino una delle pi belle occasioni per celebrare il sessantesimo anniversario di israele la sua letteratura e cultura il fatto che israele sar il paese ospite per noi un grande onore purtroppo questa occasione anche un tentativo della sinistra estrema di fare quello che succede in inghilterra delegittimare israele far s che ci che accade in alcune universit inglesi accada anche qui e io credo che sia un dovere prioritario della comunit ebraica italiana e dello stato di israele attraverso il team della sua ambasciata evitare che questo succeda questa delegittimazione la cosa pi grave che possa capitare ad uno stato sovrano io lho detto e lo ripeto che non ci sia nessun compromesso in questa fiera ci hanno invitato perch siamo un paese sovrano perch i nostri scrittori sono tra i pi riusciti e letti in italia e perch rappresentano una cultura il giorno in cui vorranno invitare nazioni arabe ci saranno nazioni arabe non pu essere che invitano israele solo se invitano anche i palestinesi questo accordo non pu esserci io lho detto se chiameranno anche i palestinesi noi non ci saremo semplicemente non ci saremo
767805 lopposizione alla presenza di israele alla fiera del libro stravolge politicamente e culturalmente levento
767806 non c dialogo se si nega ad israele il diritto di esistere
767807 mentre nelle universit britanniche possibile rifiutarsi di invitare scrittori o scienziati israeliani nelleuropa continentale la sinistra di comune accordo non aderisce mai alle richieste dei palestinesi di boicottaggio disraele perch
767808 c boicottaggio e boicottaggio e quindi sono del tutto contrario al boicottaggio di questa fiera del libro il libro va sempre rispettato e contro lo stato di israele gli israeliani che sono sempre ebrei per quanti torti abbiano nei confronti del popolo palestinese non sono in alcun modo paragonabili ai razzisti sudafricani e poi un poi che non possiamo dimenticare e sul quale noi europei e quelli di noi che si dichiarano cristiani e cattolici c la storica persecuzione del popolo ebraico ci sono i ghetti e i campi di sterminio e qui mi torna buono ricordare quel che mi disse in unintervista al manifesto il rabbino capo di roma nel ghetto di varsavia lultimo canto che gli ebrei intonarono fu linternazionale poi furono massacrati dai tedeschi
767809 di decidere insieme una nuova data lontana da quella del salone del libro per non essere associata alla celebrazione dellindipendenza di israele come pure al suo totale rifiuto della naqba palestinese
767810 lascio israele non riesco pi a lavorare con serenit sono continuamente preso di mira ci sono altri intellettuali storici giornalisti che scrivono e dicono molte delle cose che penso io ma non attaccano il sionismo quindi non rischiano la raffica di critiche e accuse che subisco io
767811 il boicottaggio una misura che funzion con il sudafrica dellapartheid e quindi pu avere effetti importanti anche con altri paesi tra cui israele per questo motivo lo sostengo due anni fa per non fui io a proporlo come stato riferito perch gi dal 2002 il mondo accademico britannico intendeva attuarlo contro israele in risposta alla distruzione di met del campo profughi di jenin e alle discriminazioni alle quali sono soggetti gli studenti delluniversit di haifa
767812 ovvero che in palestina prima durante e dopo il 1948 stato attuato un piano ben preciso volto a pulire etnicamente il territorio dove sorto lo stato di israele documenti e testimonianze a quasi sessanta anni di distanza da quei giorni lo dicono con estrema chiarezza israele in ogni caso non ammetter mai le sue responsabilit nella questione dei profughi il governo attuale e quelli futuri faranno il possibile per lasciare nei campi per rifugiati tutte quelle persone 800mila nel 1948 oggi sono circa 4 milioni ndr che reclamano i loro diritti ci sono alcune aree dove procede una politica di pulizia etnica ad avanzamento lento nellarea della grande gerusalemme ad esempio la costruzione del muro lespansione delle colonie la confisca dei terreni recinzioni e restrizioni ai movimenti delle persone stanno costringendo migliaia di palestinesi ad andare via ad abbandonare le loro case lo stesso accade tra gerusalemme e ramallah e tra gerusalemme e betlemme e lungo la strada che porta fino a gerico almeno 40mila palestinesi hanno dovuto fare i bagagli e trasferirsi pi allinterno in cisgiordania senza parlare della citt vecchia di hebron dove laggressivit dei coloni ebrei e dei soldati ha trasformato in un quartiere fantasma la parte pi caratteristica di quella citt vedete la pulizia etnica si attua in varie forme sessanta anni fa si usavano le armi per costringere le persone a scappare ora a causa del controllo dei media e delle istituzioni internazionali si usano altri metodi rendere la vita impossibile restringere le possibilit economiche ridurre le capacit di sviluppo queste nuove strategie stanno funzionando bene in palestina anche perch si uniscono alla linea del rifiuto di un negoziato vero con i palestinesi

767909 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract

767920 the challenge for government is to provide public transport that is good enough that people can and will give up their cars
767921 its no co incidence that the areas of melbourne with the most households running three or more cars are the public transport deprived outer suburbs where the buses are infrequent the trains are scarce and the trams even scarcer
767922 families can be unshackled from the rising costs of car ownership but only if high quality frequent public transport is provided in every suburb

767957 this enable dawkins in his references to deism to suggest that deists are a miscellany of believers in this and that

768111 i pledge to continue to assist in efforts to rehabilitate the party so that we can all together close ranks to draw up plans and streamline the party machinery at all levels and get ready from now to face the next general election
768112 if i was seen as outspoken and firm in my criticism believe me it was never my intention to go against the leadership the comments were made with transparency and sincerity because i want umno to remain strong empowered and credible
768113 i give the assurance that i will uphold the voice of party members and the people so that umno will remain open transparent and relevant for all time
768114 snap a job 2008 matching the right graduates with the right job
768115 i never expected to receive a special certificate from a minister and im very delighted
768116 im planning to continue with a diploma but i havent decided which institution to go to i might consider completing a degree too
768117 we will not compromise on the safety of motorists although my officers have reported that the structure is safe
768118 if the cracks were due to shoddy workmanship and traced back to the contractor or supplier of materials stern action would be taken against them
768119 we do not own a car so its cheaper to do our shopping here rather than spend on taxi fare
768120 usually the shopping is done by me or my husband we rarely get to bring the children along because we have to think of transportation
768121 its better to get something that is a bit expensive but in the end is healthy for your family
768122 i normally spend rm3 on a plate of fried mee a small piece of chicken and a drink
768123 sometimes if i have to attend extra classes in the afternoon i have to spend all of the days allowance on food alone
768124 he doesnt eat breakfast at home but will have a meal later at school with his friends
768125 i go to school and return home with my father as hes a teacher there but some times i do take the bus home if i have additional classes
768126 i am lucky in that sense as some of my friends have to spend part of their allowances on transport fares
768127 mental patients are not supposed to be in homes for the aged
768128 at this moment i do not know which act allows these patients to stay in homes for the aged
768129 hopefully my ministry and the health ministry can come up with a cabinet paper and solve the problems within six months
768130 we have many cases where our officers and other residents were hurt by them when they turned aggressive
768131 old folks homes do not have facilities to treat them
768132 they have to be treated in mental hospitals especially when theyve had a relapse
768133 at the moment my staff are managing the homes well
768134 but anything can happen as there are mental patients in the homes
768135 the drivers were lucky as they immediately moved over to the side of the highway to check their cars
768136 this is the third time it is an inconvenience to everyone because the congestion is terrible
768137 the smart card can effectively assist the department to detect those vehicles because we have access to vehicle details vehicles which have been in malaysia for more than 90 days can be easily detected
768138 with ordinary permits we can only keep track of foreign registered vehicles for a maximum of three months
768139 i am not asking researchers to throw out the old ways of doing research
768140 but they should first check whether a research idea will generate a commercially viable product before starting work on it
768141 i feel that both academia and industry as lone entities are less effective in generating the best commercial research ideas
768142 it is crucial to study current players and understand their edge
768143 it is also necessary for researchers to identify their own selling points or innovation of the research product they are trying to offer the market
768144 we even make it compulsory for all of our lecturers to attend two courses in entrepreneurship
768145 also all of our students are required to submit business proposals together with their thesis as part of their evaluation process before being awarded a degree
768146 idrus will have the full responsibility of deciding whether the case should be brought to court or otherwise
768147 this case is not a political ploy or a revenge plot we want to see justice done
768148 he is not the alleged victim the alleged victim will not have such an avenue to voice his case
768149 if there are alibis and medical reports how can they charge me
768150 they questioned the credibility of the doctor who came up with the medical report any doctor who gives a decision that does not tally with their motives will be attacked
768151 ben ou tas accept de me sucer et tas aim le faciale bah quoi tu ten souviens plus tas beugl comme une dingue que taimais a bon ben on va tre oblig de recommencer
768152 he certainly had the abilities and the training to pull off a d b cooper like stunt
768153 he had the temperament to do that and maybe had the motive
768154 he boasted of hijacking the plane and then leaping from its rear stairway to his sons and two attorneys
768155 gossett told greg to keep still and not tell anybody because it could result in his dad going to prison for the rest of his life
768156 about three hours later a 53 year old man was arrested for dangerous driving causing death we believe he is a kelowna resident but we are not yet sure where the woman is from
768157 the work and planning from the volunteers sponsors participants my friends and colleagues and the committee created an event that has the capacity to change lives from the proceeds that are generated the sandman harvest foundation sees that 100 of the funds go to kids in need and i love being a part of their efforts
768158 we have now raised and will contribute more than 850 000 to deserving children like josh dyck that need our help down the road to recovery
768159 in the comprehensive world of destination marketing success requires and up to date fresh and pertinent online presence that relates to the global traveller
768160 we have been tracking increasing numbers of visitors from quebec and europe and we have made efforts to hire multi lingual staff it is important to evolve our website in order to reach this growing market online as well
768161 housing industry and road development can disturb watersheds we recognize that the location of some of our creeks may not be accurately reflected in our current mapping system
768162 this new information will be integrated into our official community plan to assist in urban planning and watershed protection
768163 we have been working with the college since spring to make this opportunity possible a number of people in the central okanagan who are very interested and involved in baseball saw an opportunity to partner with the highly regarded okanagan college to develop a team to play in the ccbc
768164 this will add an important piece to the continuum of opportunities for okanagan baseball players and for those throughout the southern interior the ccbc is currently a five team league comprised of thompson rivers university kwantlen polytechnic university university of calgary vancouver island malaspina university and prairie baseball academy which draws from both the university of lethbridge and lethbridge community college the ccbcs governors have indicated for a few years now their interest in having an okanagan team participating and are very excited about the upcoming season
768165 its a repeat of last week we didnt play very well at all
768166 we have guys that need to step up that arent stepping up thats going to be addressed this week coming up
768167 we are not doing the little things and the little things will kill you in the long run until we figure out how to do that theres going to be a lot of work this week
768168 im concerned about the blocking for both the passing and running game all our quarterbacks made some plays and the receivers made some plays but were not doing a good job up front in the offence right now which is my major concern
768169 hoje vivemos o colaborativismo na forma de produ o do jornalismo
768170 o indesing software de editora o eletr nica por exemplo tem recursos para funcionar que voc faz fica vis vel para toda a equipe e eles colaboram no resultado final
768171 sempre que se for discutir jornalismo on line temos que esquecer este falso problema da internet versus impresso
768172 a usabilidade feita para respeitar um espa o f sico da tela como se fosse um quadro mas em breve isso n o haver mais o google foi o primeiro a perceber isso voc acessa sua conta e pode fazer diversas a es que antes eram presas a um programa

768192 nick describes it as like a two story warehouse with tables seven or eight phones tvs and its people who are there for like child support and parking tickets
768193 ha detto anche che non cera posto nelle camere sono cose ridicole
768194 sono andato avanti col collegio arbitrale io ho fatto richiesta di rescissione occorrer incontrarsi ci sono vari passaggi i tempi sono stabiliti dal collegio arbitrale io ho chiesto la procedura durgenza devo capire cosa fare da grande
768195 sono ormai 20 giorni ch ci alleniamo in condizioni vergognose a livello di materiali sul discorso fisico e atletico uno lo fa tranquillamente io per non ho fatto ancora unamichevole da quel punto di vista ci vorr tempo
768196 queste sono voci ma di ufficiale non so niente anche perch io fino allaltra sera non ero sul mercato leggendo i giornali vedo che delio rossi ha dichiarato che alcuni giocatori possono andarsene
768197 lui non ha dato spiegazioni a nessuno solo a zauri perch lui stesso lha rincorso per chiedergliele
768198 no io con lui non ho mai avuto discussioni se ci fossero state non mi avrebbe fatto giocare le ultime partite dello scorso anno
768199 non me lo spiego se fossero stati chiari dallinizio questa situazione lavremmo evitata invece se ogni volta ti dicono una cosa diversa ovvio che le altre squadre cercano altre soluzioni
768200 io ho dichiarato che se fosse vero significherebbe che i giocatori comandano pi di un allenatore e di un presidente
768201 il caso sereni era molto diverso gli era stato proposto un rinnovo che lui non ha mai accettato
768202 quella di bianchi stata una scelta tecnica avevano gi in mente magari di prendere un attaccante con caratteristiche differenti per il gioco della lazio
768203 sono stanchissimo spiega lui nella conferenza stampa di presentazione dopo la gara di bratislava contro la slovacchia alle tre di notte sono rientrato con la nazionale jugoslava a belgrado poi alle otto ho preso laereo per roma e da l per brindisi
768204 nei giorni scorsi ho parlato del lecce per telefono con il mio connazionale sakic e della mia nuova squadra ho avuto informazioni anche dai nazionali jugovic savicevic e mihajlovic questultimo conosce benissimo lorieri con il quale ha giocato nella roma la mia posizione davanti alla difesa ma sar il tecnico a decidere il mio ruolo
768205 ho studiato la roma in televisione nella gara contro la juventus e sono rimasto sorpreso dalleccezionale ritmo imposto dalla formazione di zeman per noi sar fondamentale resistere allassalto iniziale della roma ed evitare di alzare le barricate davanti alla nostra difesa
768206 il campionato italiano spiega qualche settimana dopo davvero duro richiede un impegno a livello mentale al quale lo confesso non ero abituato ormai ho superato tutti i problemi di ambientamento compreso quella della lingua spero che ci possa farmi rendere meglio sono convinto di poter fare molto di pi di quanto ho fatto finora

768208 the excessive severity of measures prescribed by the public interest
768209 this severity is alarming only for the conspirators only for the enemies of liberty
768210 appear to be intended to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping
768211 that is his perception some have told me that the offer was timely and some say it was not
768212 anyway i was merely responding to pas spiritual adviser datuk nik abdul aziz nik mat who had suggested that umno and pas be dissolved and a new party formed

768217 my priority is to campaign against anwar and i support any candidate picked by bn
768218 even her decision to resign as the permatang pauh member of parliament was decided by the couple
768219 pkr dap and pas have agreed to mobilise our election machinery
768220 comparison of the photographs i took of various snowbed sites in 1989 with those taken during this project last summer show clear changes in the pattern of vegetation
768221 analysis of the 2007 data from the plant communities on the sites shows some changes in species composition but these changes are not easy to interpret
768222 indeed these areas of scotland could be said to have more in common with the mountains of scandinavia the high arctic of spitzbergen and parts of greenland than they do with the carse of stirling for example
768223 any loss of this habitat will pose a direct threat to birds such as ptarmigan snow bunting and dotterel which feed on the insects that live in the moss and so the impact will spread through links in the food chain
768224 fraizer campbell has taken his goal very well and it wont do him any harm hes an aggressive young player very quick and determined and he can do well afp
768225 for us its just a fact we have to face that we are not reaching the same level as we did do even in the early part of last season we have to get our performance up we have to get our standards up and play very quickly
768226 i think the club are working hard to get a solution to this matter we will have to see
768227 we have an arrangement with rafael that he can go for a certain amount of money they offered us e7 million and e8 million but that isnt enough it is ridiculous
768228 he is a top player who will want to prove himself in every game i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
768229 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
768230 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
768231 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
768232 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
768233 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
768234 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end we also got some bad injuries
768235 its fantastic an incredible feeling winning here in finland means so much to me
768236 i desperately wanted to win this rally because its been one of the hardest
768237 i tried my best and im very impressed by how the low scores have been this week it was a great win for ji yai
768238 any organisation the minister has specified in writing to vice chancellors as unsuitable to the interests and well being of the students or university
768239 the act if at all relevant needs to be completely overhauled
768240 if other 21 year olds can join political parties why is it that we cant just because we are in university
768241 while i dont think student activism is highly correlated with the quality of a university
768242 im convinced that having academic and student freedom to organise and freely express their thoughts is a necessary condition towards establishing a world class university
768243 different universities in the united states and britain have taken different routes towards making themselves world class but all of them have one thing in common academic freedom for students and lecturers to express their thoughts and views and to organise if and when necessary
768244 we certainly hope the deletion of the presumptive section 15c will apply to university regulations as well
768245 when the interest came in from liverpool it was the only thing that could have ever taken me away from tottenham and thats the reason why im here
768246 i couldnt have left tottenham for any other club i think that if i didnt come to liverpool id probably have regretted it for the rest of my life
768247 english language will enhance the quality of life of our children and widen their thinking
768248 the first expectation is that students of the government run schools should be able to compete with students of private schools as in a majority of cases the lack of knowledge of english becomes a hindrance
768249 moreover for introducing them to computers or technologies english plays an important role

768251 we were able to liquidate our portfolios in 15 minutes
768252 if an etfs investing in illiquid securities and has to liquidate in distressed markets
768253 it will have the same problems as a hedge fund
768254 we have to look at the criteria for the candidate
768255 this is not the first time we are facing a by election we are making all the necessary preparations
768256 we can manage the by election and the branch meetings

768261 si la derecha toma esta actitud de darle vuelta la espalda a la gente bueno la gente no la va a reconocer en las elecciones municipales parlamentarias y presidenciales

768266 there will be no deadline and liverpool have all the time in the world now to sign gareth barry
768267 so its really up to them gareth and his agent to sort it out ive decided this is the only way forward for us really
768268 i dont think the way we finished the league was acceptable
768269 as players we set ourselves standards and the position we finished in the league 11th was disappointing and we werent satisfied with it
768270 but were confident we can challenge for the top four this season if you look at the signings we have made that shows the ambition of the club and they will all bring quality to the team
768271 its clear the top four are made up of manchester united chelsea liverpool and arsenal
768272 they are the teams who in the last few years have taken the champions league places and it is very difficult to break into that group
768273 there are some important clubs who have spent years spending a lot of money and have a certain advantage over us which is reflected by the fact they say they want to sign some of our players

768287 the increase in coca cultivation in colombia is a surprise and shock
768288 a surprise because it comes at a time when the colombian government is trying so hard to eradicate coca a shock because of the magnitude of cultivation
768289 the power to do terror and to put colombians and others at risk is weaker and weaker than it was five years ago
768290 the easy pickings in terms of spraying coca in colombia are over and for there to be progress beyond this plateau there needs to be an alternative livelihood

768302 c alls for violence and for the destruction of any state are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community
768303 this is the passage that has been isolated twisted and distorted so famously by measure of comparison ahmadinejad would seem to be calling for regime change not war juan cole president of the global americana institute agrees with norouzi adding

768351 basically we can recycle anything that is made out of paper as long as it has not been touched by food has not been painted on and is not a tissue or paper towel
768352 last year 363 tons of paper and cardboard were recycled l and sold for 31 000 if it had gone in the trash the trash bill would have gone up to 29 000 this year were probably going to have about 370 tons of paper and save 29 000 to 30 000 its probably going to retail for about 50 000
768353 one thing that employees can do is realize that probably 80 percent of what they throw in the trash can actually be recycled

768358 the programs we will be designing will allow us to offer university support to individual students to help them progress toward their degree
768359 in addition students and counselors should find the road maps data system to be a very helpful tool that will provide a clear picture of the individuals progress toward a degree

768372 generally investors have felt relieved that the earnings have continued to be better than expected realizing of course that the bar had been set awfully low
768373 we have the fed meeting but i am not expecting any big reaction to that i think the market is going to stay in a fairly well constrained trading range and is going to move up and down with daily movements in oil
768374 if you look at the financials they have been surprisingly strong despite the volatility in the market you see citigroup getting its act together and certainly merrill doing house cleaning
768375 era para haber aprovechado m s las llegadas que tuvimos el marcador fue muy apretado para lo que pas

768377 en el primer tiempo fuimos muy superiores al am rica y pudimos marcar dos o tres goles m s
768378 pues s la verdad estoy muy contenta gracias a la ayuda del equipo pude lograr ese gol fue un gol muy importante que nos dio el triunfo y a la vez es para m como una despedida
768379 s esta es mi despedida probablemente ya no estar en el equipo no es porque sea un mal club ni por mal futbol sino porque uno tiene algunos problemitas que me llevan a salir tengo que ir a mi pa s y le doy muchas gracias a todos por apoyarme
768380 estoy muy agradecida en especial con el profesor rodrigo dey t cnico quien me dio la oportunidad de estar en este equipo y agradezco a todas las personas que me han apoyado en las buenas y en las malas tanto en mi pa s como aqu a todos los llevo en mente

768395 the idea is that these speakers and languages are insignificant and have previously been ignored in the national scene
768396 but documenting each language and realizing that each language has something to contribute to the nations culture is very important for the general population
768397 the purpose of creating a database of the language is to provide a tool for anthropologists and linguists studying manipur as well as native speakers lamkang schools could also take the folktales from the database and use them in textbooks
768398 the problem is that its increasingly being mixed with manipuri
768399 in the past native lamkang speakers lived in an isolated agricultural environment and rarely mixed with outsiders now a lot of young people leave for jobs in cities in manipur and the language spoken in the schools is manipuri this has caused younger people to substitute a word in manipuri for the same word in lamkang
768400 it is in these natural interactions that the true structure of the language is revealed
768401 the tremendous growth of information technology especially the internet has fundamentally reshaped the way tourism related information is distributed and the way that people search for information about travel destinations
768402 my research focuses on how search engines can be made better for the tourism industry by understanding the problems and challenges
768403 considering that most of the search engine users view only the first three search result pages the actual visibility ratio is much lower
768404 a handful of web sites such as tripadvisor dominate the results so chances are slim for travelers who plan their vacations online to have direct interactions with many tourism enterprises and organizations
768405 although it has been claimed that the internet is the most suitable medium for rich interactive representation of cultural data they may not be capable of providing access to a culturally rich domain like tourism travelers may miss out on interesting not so famous places because its harder to access smaller web sites
768406 the online travel agencies like expedia will recommend places and activities after you book airfare
768407 you can access it while youre en route to find information about your destination

768412 the variety of grants reflects the wide variety of activities at unt
768413 each project will add to the vibrancy of our campus im pleased to provide this support and i appreciate wells fargos generous and valued donation
768414 we received 62 submissions totaling over 500 000 for the available 75 000 in funds
768415 thus the review and selection process was difficult many worthy projects will not receive funding at this time and several will receive only partial support
768416 sunday fun day is an important opportunity for students especially freshmen since the residential experience of university life and moving into your dorm when you get to college is practically a rite of passage

768423 a comprehensive review of the costs and benefits of non forestry managed investment schemes is a part of the governments plan for primary industries
768424 the rudd government recognises the important contribution that agriculture makes to the australian economy
768425 this review will take an evidence based approach to whether non forestry managed investment schemes are an effective tool for attracting investment to rural and regional australia
768426 global trade in financial services has been growing faster than any other services sector and with our sophisticated financial sector and international track record we are confident of capitalising on our strengths
768427 there will be a dedicated team within the treasury to assess and implement ideas raised at the summit and to act as a single point of contact with industry and submit an action agenda by the end of the year
768428 the issues raised are firmly on the agenda of the henry review and the board of taxations review of tax arrangements applying to managed investment trusts
768429 the importance of the financial services sector to australias economic future had been highlighted by the strong response to the summit from industry leaders
768430 the nsw and australian governments are both strongly focussed on promoting our financial services sector in our key international markets the united states china and india
768431 financial services exports are worth more than 150 billion a year
768432 the nsw government is targeting key global financial institutions to attract investment to sydney and to enhance sydneys global reputation as a leading hub for the asia pacific
768433 the government is committed to developing barangaroo the east darling harbour site as a potential future financial services precinct for nsw australia and the region
768434 we are aiming to create australias version of canary wharf or the dublin docks financial precinct
768435 the proposed revised barangaroo concept plan is to increase the commercial office space to be built on the site by between 50 000 and 120 000 square metres
768436 the revised plan is on public exhibition until august 15
768437 this willingness to share ideas and work together will contribute greatly to enhancing australias status as a financial services hub

768445 our grant funded program is intended to prepare students to become principals of highly impacted high schools
768446 we rolled the trip to mexico into our grant because of the influx of spanish speaking students in the state we are well aware that many of the parents that our principals will be interacting with do not speak english and therefore we want to make sure that the principals that we produce here at unt are conversational in spanish
768447 the principal certification programs rigor and spanish immersion program was critical in my career growth
768448 more than 30 percent of palestines high school students are hispanic being a member of a very aggressive program designed to teach language and an appreciation for culture was a major asset for me during the hiring process

768450 ive never seen anything like it spectators fell off their seats
768451 it was a raining and suddenly the lightning hit the stand
768452 we all tried to get down from the hill many screamed and cried the situation was dramatic ive never experienced anything similar
768453 i just love the fact we did not give up
768454 it wasnt the best way to get the runner over but it worked out
768455 ill just tell all of you to say whatever you want and write whatever you want
768456 thats all ive got for you today you guys write about it you saw it you write whatever you want report whatever you want
768457 youve got to step it up if you want to be in the hunt
768458 you dont want to be in the hunt go home take an early vacation come back for spring training well bring some kids up to play we should be embarrassed im not sure enough people are
768459 this team doesnt quit this bullpen has been so good its like every time we do stink it up its like theyre obligated to go out and do something and they do its incredible
768460 i was just trying to be aggressive and they hit the ball like they are supposed to when i make a mistake
768461 its tough guys battled back for us so its kind of frustrating they did that for us and we let them down pitching wise its tough
768462 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
768463 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
768464 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
768465 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
768466 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
768467 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
768468 i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself any putts
768469 the fringe ended up being a lot slower the first time i really putted through the fringe all week the putt just seemed like the right shot at the time
768470 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
768471 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
768472 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
768473 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
768474 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
768475 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
768476 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
768477 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
768478 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
768479 but some of them will stay in the hospital for observation
768480 ive never seen anything like it spectators fell off their seats
768481 it was a raining and suddenly the lightning hit the stand
768482 we all tried to get down from the hill many screamed and cried the situation was dramatic ive never experienced anything similar
768483 i think the catchers knee got him in his leg and then hunter came into his back a little bit
768484 well its never easy with all the drama but we did emerge victorious
768485 luckily it was going our way and we were able to put the ball in the net after the first goal you generally keep your cool and able to play a calmer game and thats what helped us come out on top
768486 well its kind of hard to answer that right now because i havent seen the video yet
768487 i mean it was so out of the play and in all fairness i was watching the ball the whole time
768488 i asked amado what had happened and he told me that further back field he hit me with an elbow in the chest and then he retaliated so if thats what my player is saying then i trust him the linesman is saying he didnt see anything and the ref didnt see anything so i have to look at the video before i can comment on it
768489 well toronto is a place we love to come to because we know that it going to be a great atmosphere but at the same time with the crowd out here it feels like they have an extra player on the field with them
768490 but to walk away out of toronto with three points its a great feeling
768491 i made some bad pitches and they hit those too

768495 well michelle youre a pretty girl and unfortunately that comes with the territory
768496 i was late to dsm i will serve you coffee today
768497 at the end of the match there were some long long volleys that took a toll on both of us
768498 i got very nervous and he was hitting the ball really big but i hung in well
768499 it was tough for both of us and there were a lot of long rallies your legs really burn out there and they were some of the hardest conditions of the year
768500 but i stayed calm throughout and didnt waste any energy especially when i went behind in a couple of matches in the past maybe id have let that get to me but now im playing top players on a regular basis and im better equipped
768501 i hope not but if its coming i need to take it because i charged the pitcher
768502 im a man i take my consequences i know what i did i think i did the right thing
768503 i wonder why a guy plate umpire tim timmons thought we were going to hit the guy with the bases loaded with a pitch in on the hands this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what commonsense they have when they make those decisions
768504 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody i guarantee it ill bring octavio dotel ill bring matt thornton then i will tell them to throw at them thats the way i do business
768505 i came in and im trying to get a double play ball
768506 i threw him my sinker in to try to get him to get a ground ball out of that and it got away from me i went to pick up the ball and hes charging at me
768507 i was just standing on the mound and the umpire came up to me and said youre out of here they might think there is something stemming from before but i didnt think i was being thrown out of the game obviously they thought differently and they make the call
768508 we dont play like that ozzie doesnt play like that this team doesnt play like that
768509 the pediatric neurologist told us there is no medical treatment
768510 she said take your son home and love him and save your money for his institutionalization when he turns 21
768511 hes not fully recovered by any means but he is a long way from institutionalization under medical treatment autism loosens its grip every week
768512 i hope the book provides some hope and inspiration and maybe some specific therapeutic guidance to parents of autistic children but beyond that i think its written for the families the caregivers and the educators whose lives have been affected by this disease
768513 weve got a lot of guys who come off the bench that i think could start on other teams
768514 guys that when they do play theyre always contributing and thats what you want weve got the right guys in this clubhouse
768515 he threw me three fastballs for balls and then two sliders for strikes so i was pretty sure he was coming with a slider unless he wanted to walk me
768516 so i was sitting on it and he just threw it right down the middle
768517 it takes him a little longer to get ready in the bullpen and thats one of the reasons that when we bring jeff into a ballgame its to start an inning because we cant get him ready quick enough in between innings
768518 he wasnt quite ready yet so we had zambrano go out there and throw seven or eight pitches and wait until we got the call that jeff was ready to go
768519 you just take it day by day you see how he responds each day
768520 the team gave me some runs early and that made things easier
768521 psychologically it has to be very good because we just got swept three series
768522 if we had just won this series it would have been great but getting the sweep is a lot better because it puts some space between the days that you had that losing streak
768523 i felt discomfort so they decided to shut me down for a day
768524 i dont think that its anything i have to be concerned about
768525 he looked like he was beaten but he showed determination
768526 he would not allow her to leave for several hours
768527 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
768528 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
768529 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm today
768530 i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
768531 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
768532 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
768533 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
768534 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
768535 i put in a lot of work off the court to be able to win these sorts of tournaments and it makes it all worthwhile
768536 he was making me have a lot of unforced errors
768537 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm
768538 we had like a 30 shot rally and i was dictating most the point but in those conditions when you played so many long points and youre really going for the shot your legs get really fatigued
768539 ive started to play more consistently in the bigger tournaments
768540 obviously winning your first one makes a big difference in your confidence ive never been past the quarters of a slam before so theres still a long way to go

768602 we ate the same food listened to the same music ran on the same streets
768603 and the remix are favorites of mine so it was especially nice to hear jen talk about the concepts behind each one
768604 was about a girl traveling through a town and the adventures she encounters in the remix version its all about a urban look and feel im gonna be alright
768605 was influenced by spanish harlem and the movie taxi driver
768606 is perhaps jens most famous video so far it starred her then boyfriend all i have this is another favorite of mine first of all how great is it that jen did this video with jen said the concept behind the video was just the thought of breaking up around the holidays when its snowing or christmastime it makes it especially hard to end a relationship jen said ll was professional talented and had no ego whatsoever she also mused aloud that perhaps they should do a movie together i say absolutely baby i love you in this video jen wanted just a camera focused on her a simple yet raw look washed out quality so that the emotion of the song could come through im glad
768607 were story oriented and jen wanted to return to her roots the director came up with the idea to recreate
768608 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately

768616 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
768617 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
768618 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
768619 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
768620 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
768621 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
768622 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
768623 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
768624 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
768625 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
768626 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
768627 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
768628 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
768629 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
768630 there have been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards have been maintained
768631 we want to say to the travelling public that everything is ok

768725 oggi abbiamo quasi dimenticato cosa significasse leggere un solo libro come i padri della chiesa nei primi secoli del cristianesimo certo clemente di alessandria o origene o gregorio di nissa o agostino avevano una buona cultura classica conoscevano platone o plotino ma queste letture erano soprattutto strumenti per comprendere meglio il libro dei libri lantico e il nuovo testamento vivevano in questo libro immersi intrisi posseduti dallinesauribile testo vi trovavano tutto il passato il presente il futuro luniverso la propria esistenza e la propria morte il peccato e la grazia gli angeli il mondo celeste e dovunque nascosti in ogni versetto dio e specialmente il cristo che aveva trasformato la loro vita conoscevano la bibbia a memoria una memoria di cui abbiamo dimenticato lintensit e lestensione non ricordavano passi separati commentavano la genesi con un luogo dellapocalisse lesodo col canto dei cantici i salmi con le lettere di san paolo e solo cos pensavano di giungere alla vera comprensione del testo tutti i passi della bibbia risuonavano ed echeggiavano nella loro mente sino a produrre leffetto di una immensa sinfonia e permettendo di abitare il mondo senza pericolo
768726 durante il viaggio i cristiani non abitano in case la casa costruita conclusa definita statica abitano in tende la tenda questo luogo provvisorio che oggi si monta domani si smonta il simbolo della contemplazione e di quellinesauribile ansioso vagabondaggio che ci consente la conoscenza religiosa la religione una serie successiva di tende ogni acquisto di conoscenza diventa lavvio per la conoscenza di qualcosa che sta pi avanti e cos via senza fine il viaggio non ha conclusione

768947 aana for years has been preaching that anesthesia is the practice of nursing not medicine and thus mds are not needed
768948 aana has frontally assaulted the medical practice of anesthesia by actively working to decrease funding for anesthesia training programs this has nothing to do with crna practice and everything to do with a tactical move to diminish or eliminate a political opponent
768949 aana actively opposes efforts to expand aa practice aas work under licences of supervising mds unlike nurses
768950 srnas in many programs are calling themselves residents why would that be
768951 phd crnas are increasing presenting themselves as dr so and so without clarifying their lack of medical training
768952 all of the major advances in anesthesia that have made it so safe have resulted from research performed in academic medical centers under the auspices of physicians
768953 i dont know why we cant just keep working together well like we have in past years the aanas work to expand scope of practice seemed a fair argument however i personally have become radicalized in my views when the aana started activities that attacked the medical specialty of anesthesiology by so vigorously working against the teaching rule something that really has nothing to do with crna practice and indicates other motives

769074 o sea estamos hablando de unos cimientos nuevos de una industria estatal del petr leo y de un gran complejo industrial petrolero del estado de eso es lo que estamos hablando no estamos hablando de entregar la industria petrolera como se ha venido entregando con los contratos
769075 lo que est n haciendo en la cuenca de burgos y en chicontepec es por medio de contratos

769079 he convocado a esta conferencia de prensa en calidad de presidenta de la comisi n nacional de garant as de mi partido para hacer uso de su conocimiento y el de sus militantes mi posici n sobre lo acontecido hasta la fecha y la decisi n que he tomado al respecto
769080 por todos es conocido que en el proceso electoral interno se cometieron irregularidades graves que afectaron el proceso electoral deslegitim ndolo ante los ojos de los militantes y de la sociedad
769081 de manera personal y con el apoyo de mi equipo analice minuciosamente el caso de estas dos tipos de casillas y llegu a la convicci n jur dica de que lo nico procedente es decretar su anulaci n ya que en todos los casos carece de los documentos que soportan y acreditan la legal instalaci n de las casillas y la debida recepci n del voto de los militantes
769082 por una parte dos comisionados tienden a convalidar la votaci n consignada incluso en actas ap crifas otra que es la que yo represento reitera que del an lisis exhaustivo de la documentaci n referente a cada una de estas casillas se carece de legalidad y por lo tanto procede su anulaci n
769083 que s lo dieron como resultado una apreciaci n rid cula de la actuaci n de la comisi n nacional de garant as pero lo m s grave es que acabaron por hacerla c mplice del fraude
769084 nunca se trat de una confrontaci n de visiones jur dicas ya que no se preocuparon por convencer de sus acuerdos o de vencer las posiciones contrarias por la fuerza de sus argumentos optaron por eludir la responsabilidad evitaron dar la cara al debate optaron por asumir una acci n pol tica de mayor a sin oportunidad para una discusi n
769085 renuncio a la presidencia de la comisi n nacional de garant as del prd porque las resoluciones que est n suscribiendo los comisionados renato sales heredia y dolores de los ngeles nazares validan actas ap crifas as como actas con votaci n at pica con lo que se contabilizan votos que fueron fabricados ilegalmente premiando el fraude e instaurando la impunidad ante estos hechos vergonzosos
769086 renuncio a la comisi n nacional de garant as porque al dar validez a las actas de casillas no instaladas y con votaci n at pica se convalidan las elecciones de los estados de oaxaca veracruz y chiapas contabilizando votos fabricados ilegalmente propiciando entre la militancia de estos estados un clima de confrontaciones interminable no existe en la comisi n una mayor a responsable sino un bando que act a como una fracci n en cuyo proceder priva la parcialidad

769128 sebenarnya agama hindu itu bukan agama dalam arti yang biasa agama hindu sebenarnya adalah satu bidang keagamaan dan kebudayaan yang meliputi jaman sejak kira kira 1500 s m hingga jaman sekarang dalam perjalanannya sepanjang abad abad itu agama hindu berkembang sambil berobah dan terbagi bagi sehingga agama ini memiliki ciri yang bermacam macam yang oleh penganutnya kadang kadang diutamakan tetapi kadang kadang tidak diindahkan sama sekali berhubung karena itu maka govinda das mengatakan bahwa agama hindu itu sesungguhnya adalah satu proses antropologis yang hanya karena nasib baik yang ironis saja diberi nama agama

769136 one of the demands of the novel is to favor existence if we think of a world without novels which is coming to pass then existence will become more technological and more filled with all the handmaidens of technology which is static interruption frustration when the machine fails to work properly bursts of impotent temper when the thing betrays you and a certain separation of affect between people who are living with technology because their flesh and blood becomes less and less interesting to them the capacity of their mind to function within the technology becomes paramount

769166 if i believed in jesus resurrection i would be baptized tomorrow
769167 so what if jesus rose from the dead what does that mean to me
769168 it seems to me that to believe something without evidence is always irrational
769169 it seems that evidence is crucial for any religious claims to be taken seriously
769170 so what if jesus rose from the dead what does that mean to me
769171 i assumed that given your reference to postmodernism and given that you had seemed to evaluate postmodernism negatively you were admitting that such a rejection of evidence really is irrational
769172 you think there is no objective fact of the matter as to whether some particular body of evidence really does support some conclusion there is nothing but a subjective feeling about the matter which may vary from one person to another
769173 addressing a post modern world in a post modern way
769174 i was now too experienced in literary criticism to regard the gospels as myths they had not the mythical taste

769177 ironically mass immigration is economically speaking one of the most regressive policies in the arsenal of the neoliberal neoconservative globalist establishment one that not only adversely impacts the native born poor and lower middle classes
769178 its all very well for a descendant of those immigrants to proclaim how much he likes what his ancestors did to the place but whether a native circa 1830 would have approved of the changes is perhaps more relevant to the question of whether american natives circa 2008 should endorse further immigration
769179 but as conservatives of various stripes we can see that much has been lost as well
769180 jobs employers dont want to have to hire unreliable american blacks to do and would rather hire more reliable and cheaper illegals to do

769185 was the net effect of irish immigration good for america
769186 will the net effect of mass uncontrolled mexican and also muslim immigration now be good for america
769187 was the net effect of irish immigration good for america
769188 those who opposed the immigration of the irish may or may not have been right on the particular prudential judgment but one terrifically bad effect of ellis island has been the loss of our capacity to actually reason about immigration in general
769189 if it worked out reasonably well to have all that irish immigration that doesnt mean all this mass mexican immigration will work out well because the irish were different from the mexican and other esp non western immigrants coming in in such numbers now

769208 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
769209 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
769210 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
769211 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
769212 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
769213 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
769214 because the private health sector is going to be quite happy to provide further services for people who can pay but what about the four million who cant

769404 randomized trials to optimize treatment of multi drug resistant tb
769405 cette prise en charge intensive est hautement efficace mais a des limites pr cise milton outre son co t lev lhospitalisation est tr s contraignante puisque les enfants doivent tre accompagn s par leur m re qui pendant ce temps ne peut soccuper du reste de la famille
769406 au d but nous fabriquions nous m mes notre lait hautement nerg tique en y ajoutant du sucre et de lhuile se souvient milton puis voici dix ans sont arriv s les f75 et f100 formula 75 et formula 100 des laits th rapeutiques d j pr par s c tait un progr s car ils taient enrichis en vitamine et micronutriments mais ces laits restaient p rissables tr s vite apr s ouverture enfin depuis cinq ans on dispose daliments th rapeutiques solides qui se conservent plusieurs mois

769408 nous sommes pass s aux act a fait une grosse diff rence
769409 depuis cette ann e nous sommes pass s aux act combinant le fansidar de lart sunate un d riv dart misinine et a fait une grosse diff rence
769410 le probl me cest que les parachecks ne sont pas inclus dans notre budget pr visionnel et que nous ne pourrons pas en acheter
769411 lorsque nous leur avons propos une trith rapie antir trovirale arv gratuite h a dabord refus elle s tait tellement habitu e lid e de sa propre mort raconte charles linfirmier en charge de la pharmacie la clinique de nanning elle a fini par accepter le traitement et son tat sam liore tr s vite
769412 les patients ont besoin d tre rassur s explique li lin lun des deux conseillers de la clinique je leur parle de leffet du sida sur leur organisme des modes de transmission des arv de lattitude avoir par rapport la maladie etc je les aide aussi exprimer leur souffrance psychologique
769413 aujourdhui je suis soign gratuitement je vais mieux jai bien r cup r et je peux retravailler
769414 ici la plupart des gens pensent que seuls les toxicomanes sont concern s par le sida
769415 les gens auront alors moins peur de mourir et oseront peut tre davantage en parler autour deux
769416 certains quartiers sont toujours compl tement sous les eaux dautres peuvent d sormais tre atteints pied mais les normes quantit s de boue et deau dans les rues rendent les d placements tr s difficiles
769417 beaucoup de maisons ont t s rieusement endommag es voire compl tement d truites il ny a pas une seule structure de sant encore debout lh pital est inutilisable tout le mat riel m dical a t d truit
769418 a leur arriv e au centre beaucoup denfants sont bless s ont des l sions dermatologiques la gale portent des marques de br lures ou encore des cicatrices raconte rong linfirmi re du centre certains sont tr s petits pour leur ge cause de carences alimentaires je les emm ne tous lh pital pour un examen complet remise jour des vaccinations analyses etc
769419 le plus urgent pour les dizaines de milliers de personnes sans abri gona ves cest de trouver un abri de pouvoir se faire soigner et de sapprovisionner en eau potable et en nourriture elles ont galement besoin de bidons afin de conserver leau potable et dustensiles de cuisine pour pr parer manger elles manquent galement de biens de premi re n cessit comme des v tements ou du savon
769420 dautres organisations humanitaires sur place devraient contribuer combler ces besoins aussi vite que possible
769421 nous avons fait une enqu te qui montre que 20 25 des s ropositifs sont aujourdhui malades du sida
769422 quand les patients viennent la clinique ils sont re us par les m decins dans un premier temps nous leur donnons des m dicaments pour pr venir les maladies opportunistes puis lorsque nous estimons quun patient a besoin des antir troviraux nous commen ons par le recevoir pour une s rie dentretiens pour les pr parer la prise du traitement cest un traitement vie donc cest important que les patients en comprennent les implications et pourquoi il est essentiel de les prendre chaque jour heure fixe
769423 cest une prise en charge compl te depuis la salle dattente jusqu la consultation et en passant par les entretiens conseil les probl mes sont r solus temps et nous recevons un soutien psychologique les docteurs se renseignent s rieusement sur les effets secondaires des m dicaments nous nous sentons que la maladie nest pas si terrible en plus je vois de tr s bons r sultats dans le traitement
769424 il y a encore beaucoup de stigmatisation et de malentendus autour du sida et des personnes s ropositives il est important que nous soyons capable doffrir un environnement appropri aux malades et dencourager les autres autour de nous faire de m me car ainsi non seulement les malades pourront b n ficier dun traitement mais aussi reprendre une vie normale
769425 il nexiste pas en chine de dosages p diatriques appropri s les antir troviraux p diatriques ne sont pas encore produits ici
769426 nous sommes donc oblig s de diviser des comprim s pour adultes en plusieurs morceaux pour soigner les enfants
769427 lobjectif cest darriver prendre en charge 210 patients sous arv dici la fin de lann e et de partager notre exp rience avec nos coll gues chinois du guangxi et aupr s des autorit s centrales du pays
769428 en chine nous essayons dexplorer et de trouver un mod le pour fournir un traitement efficace aux patients s ropositifs cette coop ration avec msf nous offre une exp rience utile pour la mise au point de traitements similaires nanning ou ailleurs dans la province du guangxi
769429 en l tat nous ne pouvons d tecter et traiter correctement nos malades
769430 des investissements massifs sont n cessaires pour le d veloppement et la mise disposition le plus vite possible et des prix abordables de nouveaux tests de diagnostic et de nouveaux m dicaments
769431 en guin e comme dans dautres pays en d veloppement nous avons de plus en plus de patients qui ont d j suivi un traitement anti tb et qui reviennent vers nous avec des sympt mes de la maladie
769432 il peut sagir de personnes r infect es comme de patients pr sentant une forme de

769434 trois patients dont deux sont confirm s comme tant atteints de lebola ont t admis cette semaine le 29 septembre
769435 nous sommes proches du contr le de l pid mie debola mais la vigilance reste de mise car le virus circule toujours dans certains villages avoisinants de plus la p riode dincubation pour ebola tant de maximum 21 jours certaines personnes sont peut tre infect es mais nont pas encore d velopp de sympt mes
769436 gr ce ces activit s mais aussi la mise en place de pratiques fun raires s curis es il a t possible de r duire les cha nes de transmission de la maladie
769437 la collaboration avec le laboratoire install luebo par le centre for disease control cdc permet aujourdhui de diagnostiquer les patients dans un d lai de 24 heures
769438 avec le peu de moyens dont on dispose aujourdhui on ne peut pas faire plus
769439 sous la pression des eaux les maisons et les rues se sont transform es en champs de pierres
769440 sassurer que les crimes envers ces travailleurs ne restent pas impunis
769441 explique eric delaporte de linstitut de recherche pour le d veloppement universit de montpellier qui a coordonn la r alisation de l tude avec sinata koulla shiro de lh pital central et eitel mpoudi ngol de lh pital militaire de yaound
769442 cette combinaison de g n riques en une seule dose donne des r sultats comparables ceux quon observe dans le nord o sont utilis es des trith rapies compos es de mol cules de marque
769443 gr ce ces r sultats il nest aujourdhui plus possible dopposer une incertitude scientifique lutilisation large chelle des fdc dans les pays du sud
769444 l tude doit se poursuivre pour confirmer sur un plus long terme les excellents r sultats observ s
769445 nous avons fait une enqu te qui montre que 20 25 des s ropositifs sont aujourdhui malades du sida
769446 quand les patients viennent la clinique ils sont re us par les m decins dans un premier temps nous leur donnons des m dicaments pour pr venir les maladies opportunistes puis lorsque nous estimons quun patient a besoin des antir troviraux nous commen ons par le recevoir pour une s rie dentretiens pour les pr parer la prise du traitement cest un traitement vie donc cest important que les patients en comprennent les implications et pourquoi il est essentiel de les prendre chaque jour heure fixe

769449 il nexiste pas en chine de dosages p diatriques appropri s les antir troviraux p diatriques ne sont pas encore produits ici
769450 nous sommes donc oblig s de diviser des comprim s pour adultes en plusieurs morceaux pour soigner les enfants
769451 lobjectif cest darriver prendre en charge 210 patients sous arv dici la fin de lann e et de partager notre exp rience avec nos coll gues chinois du guangxi et aupr s des autorit s centrales du pays
769452 en chine nous essayons dexplorer et de trouver un mod le pour fournir un traitement efficace aux patients s ropositifs cette coop ration avec msf nous offre une exp rience utile pour la mise au point de traitements similaires nanning ou ailleurs dans la province du guangxi
769453 ils nous ont tromp et les cons quences sur les patients sont inacceptables
769454 cela fait maintenant plus dun an et demi que nous attendons de pouvoir donner aux patients vivant avec le sida et co infect s par la tuberculose la formulation promise par merck qui leur permettrait la fois de vivre mieux et de mieux adh rer au traitement nous sommes r ellement fatigu s dattendre mais le v ritable probl me est quil nexiste aujourdhui aucune version g n rique de lefavirenz merck est donc en position de faire payer son m dicament au prix que lui seul d cide et de tarder encore pour lancer lenregistrement de son produit en afrique du sud la pr valence de la tuberculose parmi les patients vivant avec le vih sida est tr s lev e nous navons donc aucune alternative que dutiliser ce m dicament ce qui rend les trith rapies trois fois plus lev es que les autres combinaisons de la m me classe et qui sont elles disponibles en version g n rique
769455 il semble donc que loffre de merck pour les pays en d veloppement consistait surtout attirer lattention sur son produit et augmenter ses parts de march dans les pays riches
769456 si merck avait v ritablement eu lintention de rendre lefavirenz plus largement disponible dans les pays en d veloppement le laboratoire aurait imm diatement commenc lenregistrement de son produit dans les pays concern s sit t apr s son annonce et en m me temps diminu le prix des comprim s de 200 mg nous invitons aujourdhui le laboratoire merck tenir ses promesses et r duire imm diatement le prix de ses comprim s de 200 mg la seule formulation defavirenz aujourdhui largement disponible
769457 il est clair que les autorit s f d rales russes ont toutes les clefs en main pour r soudre le cas et lib rer arjan si les autorit s f d rales ne le font pas cest quelles nont aucun int r t ce quarjan soit lib r les autorit s russes connaissent depuis longtemps les noms des personnes impliqu es dans lenl vement darjan cela a t largement publi dans la presse russe et internationale sans quil ny ait jamais eu de d menti officiel tant au niveau r gional quau niveau f d ral
769458 la fa on dont lenqu te a t men e ne permet absolument pas de croire en la volont des autorit s russes de r soudre laffaire en v rit lenqu te a t entrav e chaque tape cela montrent que les autorit s veulent touffer laffaire
769459 apr s 19 mois de captivit et avec la maladie darjan il est inacceptable que les autorit s russes se contentent de vagues d claration affirmant quarjan est en vie
769460 nous demandons aux autorit s de prendre leurs pleines responsabilit s et de faire lib rer arjan imm diatement
769461 kenny gluck avait lui m me t enlev en tch tch nie en 2001

769465 venez voir la photo de said sur lordinateur vous devez voir il na plus de t te
769466 said a perdu sa t te elle nest pas revenue dieu lui pardonnera la t te est partie cest tout
769467 o est le cahier de said pourquoi est ce quil nen a pas pourquoi navez vous rien apport pour lui
769468 jai v cu cet v nement mais maintenant je peux avancer m me si cette histoire fait d sormais partie de ma vie et que je ne loublierai jamais
769469 je ne retournerai jamais l bas je pr f re rester ici et mourir la seule pens e de men approcher me terrorise
769470 je suis devenue comme folle il fallait que je la voie jai pris un taxi et je lui ai demand de memmener lh pital naturellement c tait impossible il a refus car je navais pas le laissez passer appropri alors jai d cid dy aller pied et soudain jai r alis ce que je faisais
769471 on avait lhabitude daller j nine pour le moment notre destin est de vivre dans une prison on ne peut pas bouger on nest pas libres jaimerais aller en france et en egypte est ce que je peux venir avec vous
769472 un environnement dune extr me fragilit o quelques jours sans eau et sans acc s aux soins peuvent conduire au pire
769473 ici comme ailleurs le paludisme ou les infections respiratoires demandent tre trait es rapidement
769474 vendredi 26 d cembre cest la premi re fois que je d couvre bam cela fait quinze heures que le terrible tremblement de terre a eu lieu
769475 le sida est certainement une des plus grandes catastrophes sanitaires que le monde ait connues
769476 la semaine derni re encore et cest comme a depuis lann e derni re sans am lioration
769477 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
769478 nos r sultats sur les traitements des enfants traduisent les difficult s quil y a traiter les enfants avec des m di came nts qui ne sont pas con us pour eux a indiqu le dr myrto schaefer p diatre msf comme il ny a pas de formulations appropri es pour les enfants nous avons d donner pour leur traitement des comprim s pour adultes que nous avons coup s en deux ou leur administrer des sirops difficiles mesurer et avaler cette m thode approximative de dosage et dadministration peut expliquer les r sultats virologiques obtenus qui sont loin d tre id als
769479 loms avance bien trop lentement sur la question des m di came nts p diatriques contre le sida a d clar karen day pharmacienne la came campagne pour lacc s aux m di came nts essentiels msf il est inacceptable alors que ces produits existent enfin que loms ne fasse pas le n cessaire pour approuver les m di came nts quelle recommande de mani re ce quils deviennent plus largement disponibles les enfants ont d attendre cinq ans de plus que les adultes pour avoir un m di came nt contre le sida trois en un et ils ne devraient pas avoir attendre encore
769480 au total on estime 32 000 le nombre de personnes affect es par les inondations soit la moiti de la population de bukama environ 2 000 personnes ont fui vers la colline
769481 je travaille avec msf mashad en tant quinfirmi re depuis 1998 jai eu loccasion de faire beaucoup de choses pour les r fugi s afghans que nous aidons l bas mais cest la premi re fois que javais aider mes propres concitoyens
769482 a plus de 10 jours du tremblement de terre de nouvelles questions apparaissent le nombre officiel des morts serait de 40 000 le nombre des rescap s dans bam et sa p riph rie est estim 40 000 personnes dont 23 000 pour la seule ville de bam apr s avoir fui la zone sinistr e les habitants commencent revenir les autorit s ont cr des camps de d plac s dans bam afin de canaliser les mouvements de population et de pouvoir nettoyer la ville en vue dune prochaine reconstruction si certaines familles veulent rester chez elles dautres sont pr tes se rendre dans les camps aussi les autorit s ont pr vues quelques 15 000 tentes suppl mentaires pour r pondre cette demande 6 h pitaux sur les 12 mis en place en urgence sont aujourdhui encore fonctionnels les autorit s nous ont propos de prendre en charge la couverture m dicale dans les camps nous clarifions nos objectifs plus long terme am liorer lacc s aux soins primaires r pondre aux traumatismes psychologiques et am liorer les conditions de vie des rescap s
769483 les autorit s russes ont exprim plusieurs reprises leur volont de r soudre cette affaire mais jusqu pr sent cela na donn aucun r sultat concret
769484 explique le dr rowan gillies pr sident de msf international
769485 je suis arriv bam le soir m me du tremblement de terre javais limpression de vivre la fin du monde la ville n tait plus quun amas de pierres jai tout de suite t tr s frapp par le nombre important de morts contre peu de bless s graves
769486 je re ois un appel de l quipe de zahedan
769487 je pars de paris avec un m decin nous arrivons t h ran vers 3 heures du matin le lundi 29 d cembre direction la roport national pour prendre lavion en direction de bam un nombre impressionnant de personnes et de mat riel de secours sont sur ce vol qui atteint bam vers 13h00
769488 jai t sauv gr ce mon travail du lundi au vendredi je suis sur mon lieu de travail kerman ndlr environ 180 km de bam jai appris par la radio la maudite nouvelle arriv e en face de chez moi jai trouv 28 cadavres c tait ma famille je les ai enterr s
769489 je me souviens de la premi re secousse jai propos ma femme mes parents et mes enfants de passer la nuit dehors ma femme ma r pondu si dieu souhaite notre mort cest sa d cision aujourdhui je suis le seul survivant
769490 nous sommes tous dans le m me cas nous avons perdu femmes et enfants la solitude fait d sormais partie de notre vie
769491 jai t boulevers e par cette trag die cette horrible nouvelle ma rendu malade notre magnifique citadelle tait lhonneur de notre pays liran elle nest aujourdhui quun souvenir
769492 de nombreux facteurs ont contribu faire de cette pid mie de chol ra lune des pires en angola mais avec ce que lon sait aujourdhui il ny a plus dexcuse il faut faire tout ce qui est humainement possible pour emp cher que le bilan en vies humaines prenne des proportions beaucoup plus importantes
769493 quoi quil en soit cette pid mie est hors de contr le
769494 i l est crucial que les autorit s d finissent et mettent en oeuvre une strat gie nationale afin de contenir la propagation de la maladie assurent lacc s aux installations de traitement garantissent la mise disposition gratuite deau potable et am liorent les conditions dhygi ne elles devraient galement mettre en place un syst me efficace de collecte des donn es pid miologiques et intensifier leurs campagnes de sensibilisation la maladie en particulier en dehors de la capitale
769495 d livrer ce brevet cr erait un pr c dent dangereux limiter la production de tenofovir et celle de nouveaux m dicaments une seule compagnie pharmaceutique entra ne des prix lev s en emp chant la concurrence des g n riques
769496 affirme ellen thoen de la campagne dacc s aux m dicaments essentiels de msf
769497 nous avons besoin de tenofovir pour un nombre de plus en plus lev de patients mais son approvisionnement par gilead nest pas r gulier nous ne pouvons donc pas mettre davantage de patients sous traitement avec ce m dicament
769498 conscients que laction humanitaire nest quun palliatif temporaire inappropri et co teux ce type de situation nous avons pens que le moment tait venu dengager un v ritable dialogue avec tous les partenaires gouvernementaux internationaux et communautaires qui oeuvrent pour un meilleur lendemain au sahel
769499 quand on marche dans la rue on ne sait pas si on est encore vivant ou d j mort
769500 si les soldats onusiens marchent dans nos rues on tire
769501 ces quipes mobiles bicyclette ont ainsi certainement vit la mort denfants et de personnes vuln rables qui seraient sans cette aide rest es bloqu es chez elles
769502 ici dabola nous parvenons offrir des act et gu rir nos patients en trois jours
769503 le paludisme est la premi re cause de mortalit ici avec plus de 15 de tous les d c s recens s dans les structures de soins
769504 utiliser une seule de ces mol cules favorise court terme l mergence de r sistances
769505 lune des difficult s des minist res de la sant est de monter seuls et sans soutien des propositions de prise en charge du paludisme qui tiennent la route et qui vont leur permettre dobtenir des financements de la part du fonds mondial
769506 or cest le r le de partenaires comme lorganisation mondiale de la sant ou roll back malaria dapporter ce soutien technique
769507 sans des mesures rapides pour assurer que des m dicaments efficaces atteignent les gens qui en ont besoin les d cisions des gouvernements demeureront virtuelles et insignifiantes pour ceux qui sont cens s en b n ficier
769508 dans les bidonvilles de luanda le chol ra est vraiment dans son l ment
769509 parall lement notre action qui consiste soigner les personnes malades des mesures pr ventives sont n cessaires notamment une intervention durgence massive visant approvisionner gratuitement en eau les zones touch es cette intervention doit avoir lieu tr s rapidement si lon veut viter que le chol ra ne fasse de nombreuses nouvelles victimes si rien nest fait pour am liorer le syst me de distribution de leau et la situation sanitaire cette pid mie pourrait continuer se propager au m me rythme dans les mois venir
769510 cest comme marcher avec un b ton dans la chaussure
769511 le paludisme est end mique dans la r gion mais nous assistons cette ann e une augmentation soutenue du nombre de cas par rapport aux ann es pr c dentes
769512 en juillet le nombre de consultations et dhospitalisations dues au paludisme a explos akuem nous avons soign pr s de 5 fois plus de malades que lann e derni re la m me poque
769513 ces quipes mobiles sont le seul moyen de soigner directement dans leurs villages tous les malades isol s dans ces r gions devenues inaccessibles cause de la mont e des eaux
769514 elles vitent ainsi la mort denfants et de personnes vuln rables qui seraient sans cette aide rest s bloqu es chez elles
769515 mais un petit panier de g teaux ce nest pas beaucoup pour nourrir toute une famille
769516 500 jours de d tention sans savoir de quoi demain sera fait sans savoir sil quittera sa ge le vivant cest un v ritable cauchemar
769517 nous appelons une nouvelle fois les parties en pr sence faire tout leur possible pour quarjan soit rel ch imm diatement
769518 il faut parler il faut dire la v rit pour que les kenyans puissent reconna tre ce d sastre pour quils aient peur du sida
769519 les femmes sid ennes au kenya ont t jet es
769520 des m dicaments je ne demande que des m dicaments si on me donne des arv antir troviraux je suis s re que ma vie continuera mes enfants ont besoin de moi
769521 ceux qui poss dent ces m dicaments doivent nous les apporter le gouvernement doit intervenir et faire quelque chose
769522 mais un petit panier de g teaux ce nest pas beaucoup pour nourrir toute une famille
769523 m poutine le sort de notre volontaire est entre vos mains
769524 le sort darjan est entre les mains du pr sident russe peu de progr s ont t accomplis jusquici ce qui laisse une grande marge de progression pour enfin obtenir la lib ration de notre ami et coll gue
769525 on a affaire deux types de patients des personnes qui cumulent des traumas anciens et des traumas r cents et ceux qui viennent de vivre des v nements traumatiques durant ces trois derniers mois
769526 surtout en ce qui concerne les jeunes enfants on se trouve l dans une situation de soins imm diats
769527 je lui ai propos de revenir la clinique la semaine suivante elle est revenue accompagn e de deux autres femmes qui souhaitaient me parler la liste dattente des patients pour la psychologue na fait que sallonger
769528 avec des outils comme le dessin ou le jeu les enfants peuvent trouver des supports qui leur permettent de raconter les violences quils ont subi ou dont ils ont t t moins la th rapie de groupe permet aussi didentifier quels sont les enfants qui ont besoin dune prise en charge psychologique individuelle
769529 apr s plus de 14 mois de captivit insupportables pour notre coll gue nous demandons instamment tous les membres de lunion europ enne et en particulier son pr sident silvio berlusconi de r clamer des comptes au pr sident russe vladimir poutine
769530 les autorit s russes renforcent leurs efforts pour trouver et lib rer arjan erkel chef de mission msf au daguestan
769531 arjan est un citoyen europ en msf saisit donc aujourdhui loccasion du sommet ue russie pour que la pr sidence assum e par litalie jusqu la fin de lann e applique la r solution du parlement
769532 il est absolument scandaleux quapr s une ann e enti re notre coll gue arjan erkel soit encore port disparu cette situation est la cons quence dun manque flagrant dimplication des autorit s russes et dune enqu te men e avec fort peu de conviction
769533 la pr sence de deux agents des services secrets russes lors de lenl vement darjan aurait d accro tre leur motivation r soudre lenqu te or notre grand d sarroi lenqu te a t arr t e en novembre 2002 pour n tre r ouverte quen mai dernier de surcro t nous nen avons jamais t inform s au contraire pendant tout ce temps les autorit s nous ont assur quelles faisaient tout ce qui tait en leur pouvoir pour assurer la lib ration darjan
769534 il est extr mement difficile de comprendre pourquoi les gouvernements ont t si r ticents demander aux autorit s russes de prendre leurs responsabilit s dans la r solution de cette affaire
769535 non seulement les traumatismes ont sur les enfants un impact imm diat mais ils risquent dentraver leur d veloppement leur capacit apprendre ou tout simplement tre heureux
769536 si les enfants et les adolescents ne sont pas trait s apr s un v nement grave qui provoque de la douleur et de la souffrance ils deviennent de plus en plus vuln rables des v nements m me beaucoup moins importants ils sont nu leurs blessures m me invisibles sont b antes et pour certaines ne cicatriseront pas sans aide
769537 nous craignons que l pid mie soit hors de contr le
769538 alors que le chol ra se r pandait d j un rythme tr s lev hier il a commenc pleuvoir cela ne fera que compliquer la lutte pour arr ter l pid mie
769539 les autorit s doivent augmenter consid rablement les fournitures m dicales et le nombre de travailleurs de la sant mobilis s pour combattre le chol ra elles doivent en faire bien davantage en ce qui concerne loffre deau potable la population dans et autour des zones touch es des campagnes dinformation doivent galement tre mises en place rapidement afin de sensibiliser les angolais aux mesures prendre pour pr venir linfection y compris dans les provinces qui nont pas encore t atteintes par l pid mie
769540 pour linstant nous avons t en mesure de traiter toutes les personnes infect es par le chol ra qui se sont pr sent es dans nos centres
769541 mais la tendance actuelle de l pid mie laisse penser que nous verrons beaucoup plus de cas dans les jours et les semaines qui viennent nos centres chol ra fonctionnent au maximum de leurs capacit s sans une intensification consid rable de leffort des autres acteurs en commen ant par les autorit s nous risquons de voir mourir un bien plus grand nombre de personnes
769542 mommy dares poop in da potty and it wont go away
769543 soigner malgr tout b b s enfants et adolescents dans la violence
769544 les enfants nont pas de repr sentation de la mort

769547 soigner malgr tout b b s enfants et adolescents dans la violence
769548 nous sommes ici aujourdhui pour demander au pr sident poutine quil assume ses responsabilit s et garantisse une lib ration rapide darjan erkel et pour demander aux pays membres des nations unies de tenir le pr sident russe pour responsable de l chec jusqu ce jour des autorit s dans cette affaire
769549 si la nouvelle r solution adopt e par les nations unies en faveur de la s curit des travailleurs humanitaires a un sens le pr sident poutine doit assumer ses responsabilit s en mati re de respect du droit international humanitaire en faisant avancer les recherches et en obtenant quarjan soit lib r sain et sauf il doit aussi permettre laide humanitaire datteindre ceux qui dans le nord caucase en ont cruellement besoin
769550 les femmes accouchent souvent la maison et viennent nous voir trop tard
769551 nous ne sommes plus totalement d sempar s nous contenter de regarder nos patients mourir inutilement nous fournissons des arv qui transforment la vie de nos patients

769851 kudos to the widsets team for the cool new features
769852 we both share interest in computer games and graphics we have previous experience on developing some games on various platforms including mobile ones we found widsets through a friend telling us about the coding competition currently ongoing at the same time there were also advertisements of widsets in buses and metros in helsinki we checked the developers site and noticed theres a very good sdk and plenty of tutorials and examples available after looking through the examples and api documentation we thought we could quite easily implement a game on the platform the platform got our interest as it really improves certain issues in mobile development for example delivering to big audiences without creating plenty of different versions for different phones firstly we browsed through all games available for widsets at that time we found lots of nice games and especially bombus caught our attention its visually appealing and very fun to play the online highscore concept used in the game seemed to be very nice way to attract to replay we also decided to make the user interface of the game quite much like the one in bombus so with all that in mind we started thinking of the game itself and noticed several well known concepts not yet published for widsets we wanted to pick a concept thats fitting nicely for mobile phone keypad and would be somewhat fast to code we decided to implement the match three game as the concept has proven itself to be very popular to make our game stand out from the mass we implemented the online highscores and a few small tricks like the number effect and vibration on block match we are really happy how the game finally appeared considering that we only spent quite a little time on it we are at the moment by the way coming up with a new idea about another game for widsets hope it will get as nice acceptance as wjewls did

769916 our gratification was inexpressible this said we in our heart is the true method which must become popular in the united states which must supplant the stale second hand foreign method with its flourishes its ridiculous sentimentality its anti republican spirit and its sycophantic influences tainting the young taste of the republic

769918 we dont really see as many migrations off the mainframe or back to the mainframe
769919 we see maybe doing other migrations off a platform things like openvms to hp ux or even tru64 unix to aix but not really with the mainframe
769920 no one wants to touch remove the mainframe but when i have to use it for reporting its too expensive in terms of the number of mips i have to consume so they tend to offload certain parts of the information to secondary systems running on aix or linux
769921 i have spent a bit of time over the last day and a half talking to some of my share colleagues about system z10 there is strong interest some of our sessions here address this topic and we handed out a sheet first thing tuesday morning that had more than a dozen sessions listed about what was new and then we he had a lab with an actual new z10 in it
769922 the very first session on tuesday morning was a lab with respect to running zlinux on a mainframe and giving classmates the opportunity to bring up individual linux machines on that architecture so we got that all set up ahead of time
769923 there were a number of people who wanted their pictures taken beside it last night
769924 as for its being a behemoth ive been around the industry for an awful long time and i can remember when we had a big room dedicated to big behemoths so yes this is much bigger than the thinkpad i carry in my backpack but its not a behemoth size wise at least
769925 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor
769926 it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
769927 he wrote almost constantly it was then that he formed his mental picture he saw himself as a successful writer a personality of power an advancing man and he began to work toward the realization of this vision he lived every page his life was truly the powerful life
769928 chinese shamanism is the origin of chinese civilization and culture in the wu perspective the balance and union of heavenly yang and earthly yin qi energies result in a peaceful and harmonious world likewise imbalances in these energies can result in disharmony in the world which can take the form of natural disasters such as earthquakes storms floods and volcanoes as part of this dynamic universe human beings are also subject to the effects of these energies by following and living by the balancing principles of the universe it is possible to achieve harmony in the body through study and observation of this universal way the ancient chinese wu shamans or sages created numerous methods to help people maintain rebuild their body balancing systems in order to keep their physical bodies minds and spirits healthy people have used these methods to improve their lives for thousands of years in china now we call these modalities qigong as a practitioner of some of the wu traditions i want to share my experience with westerners the reason i am bringing the reader into my personal experience is that in the course of my wu shamanic qigong practice i have realized that the external world is a reflection of the heart and that a peaceful world is brought into existence by the whole of humanity as a microcosm in the macrocosm the physical body is a reflection of the heart as well i hope that through sharing my story this ancient wisdom will inspire more people to move into a state of well being and bring peace to the world in writing qigong books and articles my intent is not to teach techniques but to share the way of my life the experience of my qigong practice and the ancient wisdom i am cultivating
769929 to clarify i work at the home depot and can confirm that we do not currently advertise on the michael savage show nor do we have any kind of sponsorship in place with the program

769936 overall its showing that the government and organized medicine is starting to validate or question that there is some valid reasoning for doing these types of treatments

769939 michael savages controversial remarks about autistic children have gotten him booted off clevelands airwaves
769940 this guys a knucklehead and i want to get rid of him
769941 that is the first interview paul offit has ever turned down
769942 what can we do next time so that its not so loud in the store
769943 we are in the process of removing any affiliation with this media outlet and radio personality thank you for your interest and attention to this matter patrick j moran director marketing cisco webex technology group
769944 treatment with medications in the absence of any clear data i hope theyre ready for the public backlash
769945 what i mean by there is no convincing evidence that vaccines are a cause of autism what i am really saying is that there is lots of evidence that vaccines cause autism but we wont read it and therefore we dont allow ourselves to be convinced by it
769946 i like dr paul offits analogy of the ocean analogy so describe to parents that the immune systems like an ocean and that at that first two month visit for example theyre going to have eight antigens added to that immune ocean think of it like eight cups of water being added to an ocean its far from overload and far from being too weak to accept those
769947 sometimes well find parents that say well i came in at two months and they got a bunch of shots i thought that was all that they needed whats their experience maybe they have a person in their family who has had a significant side effect to a vaccine what are their emotions what are their beliefs try to determine that
769948 you know what that is that is text book day one lesson in how to sell they are not giving medical advice they are selling vaccines exactly like i was taught to sell cars
769949 there is not a physiologic reason to design an alternative immunization schedule and theres no biological rationale for splitting up a dose giving an m and an r instead of mmr
769950 youtube is the perfect venue for an anecdote both positive or negative
769951 in the past that could work but its not going to work anymore now there are ways for people with these viewpoints to communicate with each other
769952 these sites are now providing people with a mechanism by which they can bypass the conventional filters and get their messages out it can be dangerous
769953 merck has analyzed the adverse events reported for gardasil relating to the recent reports of death and paralysis and based on the data available to merck believes that no safety issue related to the vaccine has been identified
769954 i am afraid they have a tremendous amount of pressure being brought to bear by the medical profession by the pediatricians by congress and by industry and so they are under pressure someday they will have to live with the fact with what they said is wrong
769955 industries did not comment they thought it was just generally going away and it practically did they came out with another report the fda about eight years later and about 1998
769956 i would say to you the fda is partly to blame for the mecuricals still being on the market all that length of time if they would have followed through with our 1982 report vaccines would have been freed of thimerosal and all this autism as they tell me would not have occurred but as it is it all occurred

769960 we brought up a new version of a clients software but we didnt see an issue till we got more volume on it and then it crossed our whole web tier
769961 we first assumed it was a database with connection pulling specific to our application
769962 hey were doing good works we have all of these common things what are they
769963 cant we just do it a couple of times a week
769964 these are our priorities this is whats important this is what we want to do
769965 heres your task do this how long is it going to take
769966 how can we do a lightweight way of communicating that people feel comfortable with
769967 by going to soa were increasing the number of failure points sometimes
769968 the lack of a portfolio view is not giving us a generic design
769969 the fact that most organizations plan for an outage that lasts up to seven days indicates a huge hole in those organizations ability to sustain business operations if a regional disaster strikes
769970 the impact of a disaster that lasts more than one week can have enormous negative impact on revenue reputation and brand regional incidents terrorism service provider outages and pandemics can easily last longer than seven days therefore enterprises must be prepared more mature bcm dr programs plan for outages of at least 30 days
769971 with the growing use of third party service providers to conduct mission critical business functions organizations that dont plan for this type of business outage can find themselves in a tough position in the event that this scenario becomes a reality
769972 enterprises with the best bcm and dr practices have a corporate culture that values availability and an understanding of the costs in terms of the financial and reputation implications associated with business process outages
769973 these enterprises also realize that following a well defined process when disaster strikes is significantly better than trying to respond to an incident in crisis mode without the benefit of planning coordination and testing which helps minimize downtime and costs
769974 combined with net framework 3 5 visual studio 2008 represents not so much a major shift in development tools or strategy as the culmination of a steady infusion of both business and web oriented features into an old familiar very successful toolset
769975 visual studio 2008 is also the ultimate in eating ones own dog food or bootstrapping microsoft used visual studio 2005 and earlier versions of visual studio 2008 to create the final visual studio 2008
769976 so as far as businesses are concerned vs 2008 has had one heck of a beta if you want to use it to create massive complex applications well microsoft has been there before you
769977 for years ibm representatives have stressed that the products the information management group builds and buys are focused on the infrastructure level despite an occasional foray into applications or tools that resemble applications
769978 the cognos acquisition clearly steps across the line in a big way so it begs the question is this an exception to the infrastructure rule or is this a whole new rule if its a new rule the list of possible acquisitions we can expect from ibm just became a lot longer
769979 cognos brings an enormous amount of capability around business decision making and business optimization we think the acquisition helps position us to not only have a tremendous amount of underlying technology in support of this information on demand strategy but provides us with some very unique capabilities as we go out and present this value proposition
769980 who are more focused on decision making and business outcomes than they are on infrastructure
769981 the faster growing part of the it market going forward has to do with business optimization
769982 executives are focused now on how do i make better decisions more effective decisions faster decisions information on demand touches on automation insofar as businesses around the world want to instrument their processes and capture more data about whats happening in real time and then they want to be able to analyze that and make forward looking decisions to better compete in the marketplace
769983 virtualization has typically been in the domain of large enterprises today we aim to simplify the adoption of virtualization technologies making it available to small and medium sized businesses
769984 the capabilities we deliver when combining ibms virtualization software and power6 technology in our new offerings help clients build more efficient businesses by saving time space and money
769985 the new system p 520 and 550 follow other smb focused system p solutions and will likely find success among the same customers and markets that embraced those earlier products
769986 availability of power6 based js22 blades is potentially a more interesting event given its availability in the bladecenter s a platform designed for the needs of small business and remote office applications
769987 in doing so the bladecenter s easily becomes the markets most flexible smb blade offering capable of simultaneously supporting three distinct microprocessor architectures four distinct operating environments multiple virtualization solutions technologies and a host of integrated add ons developed by ibms blade org partners
769988 cios recognize the importance of it in making the difference by changing business processes attracting customers and developing new products and services
769989 t hey are guarded in their confidence in its ability to create results in these areas momentum has been building for it to play a larger role
769990 this year those expectations are beginning to outpace cio confidence to deliver this sharpens cios concentration on it capabilities like never before
769991 the message is consistent across the survey business leaders expect it to make the difference rather than deliver generic it solutions
769992 it difference is the reason customers use when they choose a companys products and services
769993 making the difference involves taking on additional technical risk and cost a departure from past cio strategies that concentrated on managing these factors cios will need to become more tolerant of risk and innovation and flexible to meet changing market and customer demands
769994 two thirds of it organizations that do not meet business expectations claim that skills are at the core of their performance issue
769995 this issue is not expected to be resolved quickly because only half of cios reporting a skills issue have building it skills as a top five strategy for 2008
769996 two issues heightened interest in microsofts virtualization deployment summit the exploding interest in x86 virtualization technologies and the anticipation of a coming horse race between microsoft and virtualization market leader vmware
769997 to its credit microsoft mostly kept things on the up and up though there were occasional snipes about the cost and complexity of competing products i e from vmware
769998 microsoft focused on what it sees as the profound strategic role that virtualization will play in next generation computing processes from the desktop to the datacenter
769999 about nine months ago we formed a mainframe business unit and carved out the mainframe product responsibilities from the other business units that we had we recognized that our mainframe business unit was key to our business model and key to our growth and not just as a maintenance business but as a source of new revenues
