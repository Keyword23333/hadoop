4310018 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4310019 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4310020 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4310035 high gas prices underscore the need for a comprehensive energy policy that ensures energy security and energy independence for the united states politicians in both parties have failed to advance such a policy and this is a tragedy for virginia families it hurts at the gas pump and with our electricity bills as a common sense businessman who advocates common sense solutions i want to break the ideological stalemate end the political gamesmanship and put the american people first
4310036 lets begin by acknowledging that those on the left are correct when they say we need to promote clean alternative energy sources like solar wind and geothermal power though large quantities of these energy sources at affordable prices are some number of years away let us also acknowledge that and that those on the right are correct then they say we also need to develop domestic u s oil and natural gas production now so lets take the best ideas pull them together and get the career politicians out of the way to solve this problem

4310058 hai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertakwa
4310059 barangsiapa yang tidak meninggalkan perkataan dusta dan tetap mengamalkannya maka tidaklah allah azza wa jalla butuh atas perbuatannya meskipun meninggalkan makan dan minumnya
4310060 puasa bukanlah dari makan minum semata tetapi puasa itu menahan diri dari perbuatan sia sia dan keji
4310061 hadits riwayat ibnu khuzaimah 1996 al hakim 1 430 431 sanadnya shahih
4310062 berapa banyak orang yang puasa bagian yang dipetik dari puasanya hanyalah lapar dan haus semata
4310063 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310064 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4310065 aku punya hutang puasa ramadhan dan tiak bisa mengqadhanya kecuali di bulan syaban
4310066 dalam hadits ini sebagai dalil atas bolehnya mengakhirkan qadha ramadhan secara mutlak baik karena udzur ataupun tidak
4310067 mereka itu bersegera untuk mendapat kebaikan kebaikan dan merekalah orang orang yang segera memperolehnya
4310068 maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya itu pada hari hari yang lain
4310069 artnya barangsiapa yang punya hutang puasa ramadhan hendaknya diqadha secara berturut turut tidak boleh memisahnya
4310070 kalau mau boleh dipisah kalau mau boleh juga berturut turut
4310071 barangsiapa yang wafat dan mempunyai hutang puasa nadzar hendaknya diganti oleh walinya
4310072 datang seseorang kepada rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian berkata
4310073 tidak tetapi bersedekahlah untuknya setiap harinya setengah gantang untuk setiap muslim
4310074 jika salah seorang dari kalian sakit di bulan ramadhan kemudian wafat sebelum sempat puasa dibayarkan fidyah dan tidak perlu qadha kalau punya hutang nadzar diqadha oleh walinya
4310075 kalau yang mempuasakannya tiga puluh orang seorangnya berpuasa satu hari diperbolehkan
4310076 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310077 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4310078 dan barangsiapa sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkan itu pada hari yang lain allah mengendaki kemudahan bagimu dan tidak menghendaki kesukaran bagimu
4310079 aku pernah melakukan safar bersama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam di bulan ramadhan orang yang puasa tidak mencela yang berbuka dan yang berbuka tidak mencela yang berpuasa
4310080 sesungguhnya allah menyukai didatanginya rukhsah yang diberikan sebagaimana dia membenci orang yang melakukan maksiat
4310081 para sahabat berpendapat barangsiapa yang merasa kuat kemudian puasa maka itu baik baginya dan barangsiapa yang merasa lemah kemudian berbuka maka itu baik baginya
4310082 apakah allah yang menciptakan itu tidak mengetahui yang kamu lahirkan dan rahasiakan dan dia maha halus lagi maha mengetahui
4310083 kakek dan nenek yang lanjut usia yang tidak mampu puasa harus memberi makan setiap harinya seorang miskin
4310084 orang orang yang tidak mampu puasa harus mengeluarkan fidyah makan bagi orang miskin
4310085 yakni lelaki tua yang tidak mampu puasa dan kemudian berbuka harus memberi makan seorang miskin setiap harinya 1 2 gantang gandum
4310086 barangsiapa yang mencapai usia lanjut dan tidak mampu puasa ramadhan harus mengeluarkan setiap harinya satu mud gandum
4310087 kudanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mendatangi kami akupun mendatangi rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam aku temukan beliau sedang makan pagi beliau bersabda
4310088 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310089 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4310090 sesungguhnya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam memasuki waktu subuh dalam keadaan junub karena jima dengan isterinya kemudian ia mandi dan berpuasa
4310091 seandainya tidak memberatkan umatku niscaya aku suruh mereka untuk bersiwak setiap kali wudlu
4310092 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pernah mencium dalam keadaan berpuasa dan bercengkrama dalam keadaan puasa akan tetapi beliau adalah orang yang paling bisa menahan diri
4310093 kami pernah berada di sisi nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam datanglah seorang pemuda seraya berkata
4310094 sesungguhnya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berbekam padahal beliau sedang berpuasa
4310095 tidak mengapa mencicipi sayur atau sesuatu yang lain dalam keadaan puasa selama tidak sampai ke tenggorokan
4310096 anas bin malik hasan al bashri dan ibrahim memandang tidak mengapa bagi yang berpuasa
4310097 tidak mengapa berkumur kumur dan memakai air dingin dalam keadaan puasa
4310098 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310099 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4310100 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada suatu malam keluar dan shalat di masjid orang orang pun ikut shalat bersamanya dan mereka memperbincangkan shalat tersebut hingga berkumpullah banyak orang ketika beliau shalat mereka pun ikut shalat bersamanya mereka meperbincangkan lagi hingga bertambah banyaklah penghuni masjid pada malam ketiga rasulullah shallalalhu alaihi wa sallam keluar dan shalat ketika malam keempat masjid tidak mampu menampung jamaah hingga beliau hanya keluar untuk melakukan shalat shubuh
4310101 amma badu sesungguhnya aku mengetahui perbuatan kalian semalam namun aku khawatir diwajibkan atas kalian sehingga kalian tidak mampu mengamalkannya
4310102 aku keluar bersama umar bin al khaththab radhiyallahu anhu suatu malam di bulan ramadhan ke masjid ketika itu manusia berkelompok kelompok 2 ada yang shalat sendirian dan ada yang berjamaah maka umar berkata
4310103 sebaik baik bidah adalah ini orang yang tidur lebih baik dari yang bangun ketika itu manusia shalat di awal malam
4310104 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidak pernah shalat malam di bulan ramadhan atau selainnya lebih dari sebelas rakaat
4310105 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam menghidupkan malam ramadhan bersama manusia delapan rakaat kemudian witir dikeluarkan oleh ibnu hibban dalam shahihnya 920 thabrani dalam as shagir halaman 108 dan ibnu nasr qiyamul lail halaman 90 sanadnya hasan sebagaimana syahidnya
4310106 umar bin al khaththab menyuruh ubay bin kaab dan tamim ad daari untuk mengimami manusia dengan sebelas rakaat
4310107 ketika itu imam membaca dua ratus ayat hingga kami bersandar bertelekan pada tongkat karena lamanya berdiri kami tidak pulang kecuali ketika furu fajar
4310108 bahwa umar mengumpulkan manusia di bulan ramadhan dengan dua puluh satu rakaat membaca dua ratus ayat selesai ketika awal fajar
4310109 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310110 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4310111 hai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertaqwa
4310112 pembeda antara puasa kita dengan puasanya ahli kitab adalah makan sahur
4310113 barokah itu ada pada tiga perkara ats tsarid dan makan sahur
4310114 tidak dikenal perawi lainnya tsiqat dipercaya red hadits ini mempunyai syahid saksi penguat red dalam riwayat abu hurairah yang diriwayatkan oleh al khatib dalam munadih auhumul sami watafriq 1 203 sanadnya hasan
4310115 sesungguhnya makan sahur adalah barakah yang allah berikan kepada kalian maka janganlah kalian tinggalkan
4310116 sahur itu makanan yang barakah janganlah kalian meninggalkannya walaupun hanya meneguk setengah air karena allah dan malaikat nya bershalawat kepada orang orang yang sahur
4310117 kami makan sahur bersama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian beliau shalat
4310118 di antara kebiasaan arab mengukur waktu dengan amalan mereka misal kira kira selama memeras kambing fawaqa naqah waktu antara dua perasan selama menyembelih onta sehingga zaid pun memakai ukuran lamanya baca mushaf sebagai isyarat dari beliau radhiyallahu anhu bahwa waktu itu adalah waktu ibadah dan amalan mereka membaca dan mentadhabur
4310119 pembeda antara puasa kami dan ahlul kitab adalah makan sahur
4310120 sahur adalah makanan yang barakah janganlah kalian tinggalkan walaupun hanya meminum seteguk air karena allah dan malaikat nya memberi sahalawat kepada orang orang yang sahur
4310121 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310122 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4310123 para sahabat muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah orang orang yang paling bersegera dalam berbuka dan paling akhir dalam sahur
4310124 berpegang dengan rasul mereka dan menolak semua yang merubah sunnah
4310125 umatku akan senantiasa dalam sunnahku selama mereka tidak menunggu bintang ketika berbuka puasa
4310126 agama ini akan senantiasa menang selama manusia menyegerakan berbuka 1 karena orang orang yahudi dan nasrani mengakhirkannya
4310127 hai orang orang yang beriman masuklah kamu dalam islam secara kaffah
4310128 ini perkara perkara kecil furu khilafiyah dan hawasyiyah kita wajib meninggalkannya kita pusatkan kesungguhan kita untuk perkara besar yang memecah belah shaf kita dan mencerai beraikan barisan kita
4310129 tiga perkara yang merupakan akhlak para nabi menyegerakan berbuka mengakhirkan sahur dan meletakkan tangan kanan red di atas tangan kiri dalam shalat
4310130 marfu dan mauquf shahih adapaun yang marfu ada perawi yang tidak aku ketahui biografinya
4310131 sesungguhnya telah datang kepadamu seorang rasul dari kaummu sendiri berat terasa olehnya penderitaan olehmu sangat menginginkan keimanan dan keselamatan bagimu amat belas kasihan lagi penyayang terhadap orang orang mukmin
4310132 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berbuka dengan korma basah ruthab jika tidak ada ruthab maka berbuka dengan korma kering tamr jika tidak ada tamr maka minum dengan satu tegukan air
4310133 tiga doa yang dikabulkan doanya orang yang berpuasa doanya orang yang terdhalimi dan doanya musafir
4310134 tiga orang yang tidak akan ditolak doanya orang yang puasa ketika berbuka imam yang adil dan doanya orang yang didhalimi
4310135 sesungguhnya orang yang puasa ketika berbuka memiliki doa yang tidak akan ditolak
4310136 telah hilang dahaga dan telah basah uart urat dan telah ditetapkan pahala insya allah
4310137 barangsiapa yang memberi buka orang yang puasa akan mendapatkan pahala seperti pahalanya orang yang berpuasa tanpa mengurangi pahalanya sedikitpun
4310138 telah makan makanan kalian orang orang bajik dan para malaikat bershalawat mendoakan kebaikan atas kalian orang orang yang berpuasa telah berbuka di sisi kalian
4310139 allahumma ath im man ath amanii wa as qi man saqoonii
4310140 ya allah berilah makan orang yang memberiku makan berilah minum orang yang memberiku minum
4310141 ya allah ampunilah mereka dan rahmatilah berilah barakah pada seluruh rizki yang engkau berikan
4310142 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310143 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4310144 dan makan minumlah hingga terang bagimu benang putih dan benang hitam yaitu fajar kemudian sempurnakanlah puasa itu sampai datang malam
4310145 jika lupa hingga makan dan minum hendaklah menyempurnakan puasanya karena sesungguhnya allah yang memberinya makan dan minum
4310146 allah meletakkan tidak menghukum umatku karena salah atau lupa dan karena dipaksa
4310147 barangsiapa yang terpaksa muntah maka tidak wajib baginya untuk mengqadha puasanya dan barangsiapa muntah dengan sengaja maka wajib baginya mengqadha puasanya
4310148 berdiam beberapa malam dan berbuka di bulan ramadhan ini adalah bukti kurang agamanya
4310149 aku pernah bertanya kepada aisyah mengapa orang haid mengqadha puasa tetapi tidak mengqadha shalat aisyah berkata apakah engkau wanita haruri 1 aku menjawab aku bukan haruri tapi hanya sekedar bertanya aisyah berkata kamipun haidh ketika puasa tetapi kami hanya diperintahkan untuk mengqadha puasa tidak diperintahkan untuk mengqadha shalat
4310150 jima dengan sengaja tidak ada ikhtilaf perbedaan pendapat padanya bahwa hal tersebut membatalkan puasa adapaun jika jima tersebut terjadi karena lupa maka sebagian ahli ilmu menganggapnya sama dengan orang yang makan dan minum dengan tidak sengaja
4310151 menunjukkan bahwa jima membatalkan puasa seperti halnya makan dan minum tidak ada perbedaan pendapat akan hal ini
4310152 sekarang pergaulilah mereka dan carilah apa yang telah ditetapkan allah untuk kalian
4310153 pernah datang seseorang kepada rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian ia berkata ya rasulullah binasalah aku rasulullah bertanya apa yang membuatmu binasa orang itu menjawab aku menjimai istriku di bulan ramadhan di siang hari red rasulullah bersabda apakah kamu mampu memerdekakan seorang budak orang itu menjawb tidak rasulullah bersabda apakah engkau mampu memberi makan enam puluh orang miskin orang itu menjawab tidak rasulullah bersabda duduklah diapun duduk kemudian ada yang mengirim satu wadah korma kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam rasulullah bersabda bersedekahlah orang itu berkata tidak ada di antara dua kampung ini keluarga yang lebih miskin dari kami rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pun tertawa hingga terlihat gigi serinya lalu beliau bersabda ambillah berilah makan keluargamu
4310154 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4310155 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak

4310167 in a survey of more than 11 000 psychiatric and police workers throughout the country conducted for the national center on child abuse and neglect researchers found more than 12 000 accusations of group cult sexual abuse based on satanic ritual but not one that investigators had been able to substantiate
4310168 one respondent cited as evidence the ritual abuse behavior checklist a dubious diagnostic checklist which includes many behaviors common to childhood gould 1986
4310169 our research leads us to believe that there are many more children being abused in the name of god than in the name of satan
4310170 our survey revealed that there was essentially no hard evidence of organized child abusing satanic cults that had infiltrated preschools or the fbi or that had kidnapped or slain babies in contrast there was much indirect evidence of clinical induction of false memories and plentiful evidence of religion related abuse including sexual abuse by catholic priests although much of my research indicates that children can have largely accurate memories and can resist strong suggestions they can in contrast as indicated by the dramatic examples of ritual abuse claims also tell wild tales cave in to misleading questions and make important errors the same is true of some adults of course all of the books about personal cases of sra were written by adults who seem to have believed their own stories

4310198 a vacation you think this was a vacation that i ran off with smoking man for mulder i cant even begin to consider what you might be saying here
4310199 im dying to know what im implying about your vacation
4310200 second of all what i did is my business i do not have to answer to you most of all i dont appreciate the implication that the chance to spend time with a man any man is enough to shut off my brain
4310201 if its not true then why are you feeling so defensive about it
4310202 maybe i just dont like being questioned like a murder suspect
4310203 you arent going to waltz out of here like that
4310204 what happened in those days that you trusted him scully what did he do what did he say
4310205 maybe because im tired of being treated like an idiot maybe its because i just spent a few days on the road and i dont need you telling me how wrong i was to put my trust in someone especially you mr trust everyone maybe because i cant believe you dont trust me implicitly the way i trust you
4310206 i have always trusted you its just a little hard to grasp that my partner ran off with the man we know is our enemy for a little rendezvous that she trusted him and that she didnt even leave me a note a clue anything i thought more of you scully i didnt think youd ditch me
4310207 im going home i told you i wasnt going to listen to this
4310208 do what you want thats what you always do isnt it
4310209 thats what i always do thats what i always do
4310210 damn you mulder you selfish son of a bitch everything i do even this vacation of mine has been for the work and for you i know that youre angry ill even understand that youre angry but dont you dare for a second pretend im the selfish one here
4310211 what do you want scully what do you want me to do what do you want me to think
4310212 trust me trust that i did what i thought was right
4310213 im not going to jump through hoops to get you to believe me dont want just do it
4310214 except i think youd shoot me if i dragged you into my lair
4310215 im trying to get you out of my head honey
4310216 what am i going to do i can feel you youre under my skin i can almost see you lounging about like a big cat licking your lips when you breathe in i breathe out hell i didnt even have to look you up i know where you are i knew where you were last night i was practically there with you that was a shitty little college bar by the way why did you even bother
4310217 the sloppy one the one who was raving like a lunatic
4310218 raving like a lunatics rather harsh isnt it after all darling she had something like eight shots of vodka in her
4310219 but you know what i think im going to kill her
4310220 im going crazy with you in my head darling if i dont kill someone soon i might have to take more desperate measures i thought she was awfully pretty even if she was so drunk she couldnt stand up shes probably depressed im probably doing her a favor
4310221 and if not im doing the world a favor there are too many college binge drinkers maybe i should go on a killing spree take out a whole bunch of dumb college students who think the world is about getting shitfaced on friday nights to impress their sorority sisters
4310222 you didnt say that a few weeks ago did you
4310223 oh i forgot if you want someone dead its for all the right reasons isnt it

4310233 come on that sort of thing doesnt actually happen right
4310234 what would you want a community of people to look like
4310235 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4310236 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4310237 all of the tracks will feature major artists and the production will be done by the some of the hottest indie producers in the world said prep

4310249 venganse vamos a correr motos y los gobers le contestaron deja me pongo tenis

4310251 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
4310252 this lady was just pregnant and here she goes again

4310256 see how the track isnt as distinct kind of muddled and look
4310257 he should be in myrtle beach you know if hes going to take a vacation at this time
4310258 the journey is your own no one elses its your own journey and youll come to understand that by the time you reach the end
4310259 how nice for all you fucking straight people who dont work as hard as i do
4310260 if you experience bleeding from the eyes or the sudden loss of your anal sphincter discontinue use of lyrica at once and contact your physician if you have freckles lyrica may not be for you
4310261 shes only 18 swimming in her first olympics at eighteen years of age
4310262 as opposed to all those eighteen year olds who are nineteen
4310263 knowledge is not comparable with intelligence knowledge is not wisdom wisdom is not marketable it is not a merchandise that can be bought with the price of learning or discipline wisdom cannot be found in books it cannot be accumulated memorized or stored up wisdom comes with the abnegation of the self to have an open mind is more important than learning and we can have an open mind not by cramming it full of information but by being aware of our own thoughts and feelings by carefully observing ourselves and the influences about us by listening to others by watching the rich and the poor the powerful and the lowly wisdom does not come through fear and oppression but through the observation and understanding of everyday incidents in human relationships in our search for knowledge in our acquisitive desires we are losing love we are blunting the feeling for beauty the sensitivity to cruelty we are becoming more and more specialized and less and less integrated wisdom cannot be replaced by knowledge and no amount of explanation no accumulation of facets will free man from suffering knowledge is necessary science has its place but if the mind and heart are suffocated by knowledge and if the cause of suffering is explained away life becomes vain and meaningless and is this not what is happening to most of us our education is making us more and more shallow it is not helping us to uncover the deeper layers of our being and our lives are increasingly disharmonious and empty
4310264 what is essential for man whether young or old is to live fully integrally and that is why our major problem is the cultivation of that intelligence which brings integration
4310265 that person only going to become defensive and nothing but trouble can come of it
4310266 for not man but god separates those whom the roman pontiff who exercises the functions not of mere man but of the true god having weighed the necessity or benefit of the churches dissolves not by human but rather by divine authority
4310267 hence the pope is crowned with a triple crown as king of heaven and earth and of the lower regions infrenorum the fiery place
4310268 all the faithful must believe that the holy apostolic see and the roman pontiff possesses the primacy over the whole world and the roman pontiff is the successor of blessed peter prince of the apostles and is true vicar of christ and head of the whole church and father and teacher of all christians and that fukk power was given to him in blessed peter to rule feed and govern the universal church by jesus christ our lord
4310269 the self aware universe how consciousness creates the material world
4310270 well yeah sure experiments but this relationship between particles really isnt important we mustnt look into any of the consequences of this transcendent domain if it can even be interpreted that way
4310271 i now know what reality is like and this takes away all the unhappiness that one ever had this is infinite this is joy this is consciousness
4310272 the universe is supposed to have existed for fifteen billion years so if it takes consciousness to convert possibility into actuality then how could the universe be around for so long
4310273 all these things are in me but i am not in them
4310274 i have nothing to lose and i am going to investigate only truth so why not see
4310275 you are putting on scientific blinders you dont realize that consciousness is the ground of all being
4310276 how can you ever do science without assuming that there is reality and material and all this how can you do science if you let consciousness do things which are arbitrary
4310277 say what you said say it again they tell me im crazy but you told me im golden
4310278 do not withhold your mercy from me o lord may your love and your truth always protect me for troubles without number surround me my sins have overtaken me and i cannot see they are more than the hairs on my head and my heart fails within me
4310279 answer me quickly o lord my spirit fails do not hide your face from me or i will be like those who go down to the pit let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love for i have put my trust in you show me the way i should go for to you i lift up my soul rescue me from my enemies o lord for i hide myself in you teach me to do your will for you are my god may your good spirit lead me on level ground
4310280 oh no thats the thing about little towns we dont take credit cards
4310281 disposable looking at two sets one name brand one off brand the pictures look very similar
4310282 9 times out of 10 its not going to last as long as the name brand tv would
4310283 weve seen a number of examples in the last six months where people have spent 800 to 1 200 dollars
4310284 their tv works for about eight months to a year it doesnt work after that
4310285 weve had real difficulty in getting parts for those off brand tvs because theyre manufactured in china or in taiwan and theres no support circuit set up in the united states for that
4310286 weve seen a number of times when people have done that and they end up just getting a refund on their tv as opposed to getting the tv fixed
4310287 its a great idea it gives you peace of mind that way you know youre covered if you have any problems as opposed to having to send it off somewhere
4310288 power supply was 47 for the price they said yes well have it in sixty days
4310289 so im kind of stuck with a tv thats valued at 700 800 and its actually worth nothing right now
4310290 our port visit to umm qasr demonstrates the great confidence we have in our iraqi partners and reflects the marked improvements in security that they have achieved within the past several months
4310291 this visit gave us a chance to interact with senior iraqi navy
4310292 making a port visit to iraq and interacting with iraqi officers is very important because it builds relationships and promotes positive interaction between our navies
4310293 today was a once in a lifetime opportunity and i am proud to help make a positive difference in iraqs future
4310294 this is an important day for us and for iraq
4310295 having this ship visit umm qasr is a big step and we hope more coalition ships can visit this port as well
4310296 our forces are here to foster security and cooperation in the region and to conduct operations that contribute to peace and stability
4310297 u s and coalition forces provide the assurance of security and stability that enables the economic development and growing prosperity of the people throughout this region the people of iraq are beginning to enjoy these benefits and our cooperation with the iraqi will ensure that they prosper as they expand their participation in the global economy
4310298 we just want to cause some confusion in the pass rush pickups for the offensive line
4310299 we can bring any number of guys from a number of different places
4310300 having so much talent in the linebacking corps it allows us to do things like that
4310301 were able to move guys around and have one guy cover one guy blitz and then switch it around we can do so much
4310302 theres a lot of comfort camaraderie trust in one another and we understand what each other is thinking
4310303 through that you can play hard and not really think
4310304 we brought all four linebackers out there moving around and you could see the quarterback get a little confused pointing at this guy that guy if we continue to grow with that scheme well bring more and more of it
4310305 if they ran the right play or something like that theres some risk but what we try to do in situations where they run is react before they can make a first down
4310306 our guys are athletic enough to get off blocks and them not knowing where were going to be or what were trying to get done they could be thrown for a loss too it could work both ways
4310307 i welcome that opportunity and i would like to say well see more of it
4310308 i just think i bring versatility and now we have four good solid experienced linebackers to have room to work so well see what they come up with
4310309 if its so bad why do you put up with it
4310310 big daddy the strangest thing happened while i was in the bathroom
4310311 what if a child were in there there head wouldnt reach to turn it back on while they sat on the pot
4310312 why didnt you just wave your hand in the air
4310313 if our final day has come lets pretend to carry on live on
4310314 you are like a bitter pill that i had to take against my will
4310315 streets turn into graves when the weak ones lose the fight
4310316 lost and so alone born but never known left out on their own forgotten children

4310326 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4310327 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4310328 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4310329 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4310330 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4310331 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4310332 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4310336 we all know that left wing radicals from the 1960s have hung around academia and hired people like themselves but if you thought they were all harmless antiquated hippies youd be wrong todays radical academics arent the legion and far from being harmless they spew violent anti americanism preach anti semitism and cheer on the killing of american soldiers and civilians all the while collecting tax dollars and tuition fees to indoctrinate our children

4310354 comparing the current episode to the last 20 years which includes the recessions in the early 1990s and early 2000s the level of claims was higher during those downturns than it is currently but the level never got as high as it is now without going even higher
4310355 its because of you little motherfuckers that were out of work
4310356 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4310357 the jackals are already sniffing at our body assuming its a corpse seeking to take whatever they can find to build their own schools were not dead yet at least wait until the corpse is cold
4310358 ive been looking forward to putting this to rest and putting it out on the floor so that we can put a vote to it
4310359 and further by these my son be admonished of making of many blogs there is no end and of much reading of blogs is a weariness of the flesh
4310360 i can prove it with the international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4310361 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4310362 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4310363 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4310364 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4310365 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4310366 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4310367 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4310368 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4310369 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4310370 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4310371 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
4310372 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
4310373 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say
4310374 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
4310375 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you
4310376 wow great blog you have here keep up the good work
4310377 if youre looking for ethnic meat then youve come to the right place
4310378 i cant begin to describe how much i love your blog youre so fucking hillarious i could kiss you
4310379 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
4310380 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
4310381 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4310382 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4310383 i dont think that the roll call would necessarily be that productive
4310384 the search and rescue team is engaged in the process but conditions are unflyable at the moment and the avalanche danger is at extreme
4310385 so there are two variables with the rescue one is that we cant get the rescue helicopter in and the other is that its too dangerous for the search and rescue personnel to get out of the helicopter
4310386 estamos gozando mucho este momento y agradecemos a todos los que han estado cerca en estos d as de tanta felicidad
4310387 its hard to pinpoint a specific group of people we dont expect children to come to us with problems but we may find one or two teenagers want to speak to us
4310388 life can often throw up unexpected problems such as a loss in the family divorce illness or a crisis that brings on depression
4310389 sitting with a cup of tea in a safe local environment with someone to talk to can actually make a difference
4310390 that lies at the heart of what we are about the whole thing depends on trust and so we are opening our doors and saying come in and see how we can help
4310391 those available will be only too willing to listen chat and if need be pray in complete confidence with anyone who feels that this might just help
4310392 our congregation came up with many suggestions for the new name of the old book store and we eventually agreed to go with oasis
4310393 when you think of the definition a quiet place for rest and refreshment then it sums up exactly what we are about
4310394 maintain and strengthen the publics trust in the integrity of the public body and its members in conducting public business
4310395 members were appalled to be told that the chairman had only visited the hospital some three weeks ago for the first time since his appointment nine months ago yet he maintained that the nhsggc board is coming to grips with the issues around the vale and is trying to build faith and confidence in its ability to deal with the immense challenge of complex and difficult issues at the hospital
4310396 internationally speaking its a strategic nomination because he is pro european and he knows how brussels works
4310397 she received a call on her mobile phone and the accused stated to her that he was on his way to meet her and that he intended to assault her
4310398 the basis that this took place was a very very immature young man who was upset and angry about contact difficulties it is unlikely to be repeated
4310399 its fast becoming apparent that theyve not thought this through and as a result police boards are being left in the lurch without the necessary funds
4310400 the snp were happy to grandstand with a pledge of 1000 extra bobbies but the reality on the ground is different
4310401 at the last count there were fewer police officers in scotland than under the previous government
4310402 labour promised no new police officers in their manifesto and further to that no extra funding for policing they even failed to support the snp governments proposals for extra police officers when it came to the scottish parliament
4310403 the good news is the snp is committed to recruiting 1000 extra police officers and they will be delivered by 2011 as promised
4310404 it keeps me young and its something i do to have fun its almost like going to the shows for me
4310405 when i was young i was never a sportsman i was more of a climber i was even nicknamed monkey because of it
4310406 after the skydive i had planned to do a paraglide or something along those lines this year so when the zipline came up that was ideal
4310407 im going round all the local shops and pubs to put cans in there to raise more money and get people to pop in a pound for leukaemia
4310408 especially my wife rae but they are all still supporting me
4310409 jim was one of the first to sign up and we were a bit surprised when we noticed his date of birth on the entry form
4310410 good for him were delighted that at his age he is so keen to take part in this exhilarating event and support us
4310411 officers asked the accused to step into the hallway he began shouting and swearing telling the officer to f off and calling him an a hole
4310412 we are all there to play our part but im pleased to have got the two goals its not a bad start considering i started the season on the bench
4310413 it is tough for everyone going to elgin but our first half performance was terrible all through the side we werent playing to our capabilities
4310414 but we got a swift kick up the backside at half time and after our second half performance we maybe deserved to win
4310415 i had quite a few chances against annan so i was just happy to see one of them hit the net eventually
4310416 its good to get all the boys together on the bus we have to do these journeys at some point so theres no time like the present
4310417 one positive in recent games has been the character weve shown to come from a goal down with everyone working together
4310418 i am very interested to see how the sailors start
4310419 im curious to know whether they go in all guns blazing or with anticipation on the first day i can learn so much from watching back here
4310420 the brits train very differently from some of the other big sailing nations so many people are worried about the wind being too gentle that they are not allowing for the odd day of heavier breezes so i think many crews will come unstuck
4310421 all the british sailors are in great shape and if its their day then any of them could win
4310422 theyve all won medals at major championships so theres no reason why they cant do it again
4310423 screw the french and their politics give me their cheese
4310424 trill old girl forget about what you want ed to be when you grow up you did what you love followed your calling youre living the dream youre good at it one of the best they say and yet youre broke and on the verge of bankruptcy contrary to conventional platitude the money doesnt follow when you do what you love so its not what do you want to do when you grow up its what can you do which will earn a livable salary pay your medical bills mortgage and tofu expenses and even allow you to take a vacation once a year
4310425 think girl think youre going to be unemployed this is crisis time youre not running around panicking and thats good but you have to figure out what youre going to do
4310426 i know okay i know sheesh get off my back will ya im trying to figure out this thing which is my life okay i know all right already i know i have to figure out what im going to do i know
4310427 going back to school is the easy option your personal cowards way out you know that youre good at school for you its a safe house going back to school is a cop out for you just so were clear on that point youre masking the problem by throwing another degree on the fire but you know hey maybe this time maybe in this case taking a time out racking up student loan debt and going back to a comfortable environment for you would be good on a lot of levels its still a cop out but maybe this time you can be allowed a cop out the is really bad unemployment numbers are skyrocketing theres a lot of competition for a few jobs creative professionals arent hired as full time staff anymore its turned to a consultant profession you need health insurance and a steady paycheck so consulting isnt for you right now hmmmm maybe going back to college and riding out the behind the safe confines of student loans and academia is a good option for you especially if you get a degree in an in demand high salary earning profession and really what is recession a recess you need a recess from life recess school yeah this means something all signs point to going back to college or playing hopscotch and swinging upside down on the monkey bars so think girl think if youre going to do this you better do it right
4310428 i know duh okay i know thats the pressure point what i like the things id like to do the things i might be good at doing are the things everyone else wants to do so the competition will be tough even if the ends in a few years a bunch of us will be competing for the same jobs
4310429 tut tut stop that were brainstorming here there are no bad ideas everythings viable at this point make a list
4310430 keep up the good work glad youre on our side

4310462 it has not been that long since you last asked me this same question gopher the answer remains the same i do not know now please climb back onto my antlers you are making me dizzy
4310463 the air is very still gopher but i believe i saw the grass rustling some distance ahead it may be the coyotes
4310464 you should refresh yourselves gopher and bird at this point i leave you to the remainder of your journey go with courage
4310465 thank you bird your song was beautiful i hope i will be able to listen to it again soon
4310466 you realize you do not belong here do you not
4310467 this may surprise you gopher we knew of your approach long before your arrival the birds who carried news of us to you have been singing about you ever since you left the prairie below i for one did not think for a moment you would complete your journey you are brave you are also very foolish
4310468 i have sent them away for now but they are near enough to hear me call for them because only you have come here i saw no need for the others to be present what you say to me i shall say to them
4310469 then you will hear me out before you kill me
4310470 have your say gopher i shall consider your words in the meantime
4310471 you came here at great peril to yourself and your message is wise for such a small creature you will not die today because of your bravery but know this our kind live by the hunt and it is the h unters way which allows us to survive and raise our young prey is plentiful here on our hill and those who stray from their territories away from their kind are fair game they understand this as long as this remains so there is no reason for coyotes to come to the prairie take this message to the creatures of your prairie they must stay where they live and be mindful that if game becomes scarce on this hill we will come to the prairie and you will need to protect yourselves any creatures of the prairie who come to this place will be subject to the ways of the hill and its inhabitants take this message home with you and make certain all hear and abide by my words

4310509 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4310510 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4310511 with 5 5 billion in profits verizon can afford to stop outsourcing the high quality family supporting jobs that our communities need today thousands of our members will be picketing and rallying from virginia to massachusetts to let verizon management know that we need to have a fair contract by midnight sunday
4310512 it creates new union jobs including major growth areas like fios it takes a big step forward on health care and it brings hundreds of verizon business employees the union rights they deserve we applaud management for agreeing to keep the best health coverage in america and for their commitment to work with us for real health care reform this settlement provides a framework for growth at verizon and a good standard of living with careers for our members
4310513 this agreement is a tribute to the solidarity and activism of ibew and cwa members working at verizon
4310514 our members mobilized strong and negotiated hard for a good contract that will benefit workers and their families now and in the future we congratulate union and company negotiators for finding solid common ground upon which we can build a better verizon with this agreement we have met our goals to protect the retirees who helped build this company and have negotiated important provisions that will ensure future jobs for union members

4310526 what i want to do now is get on with my life in the army but i will always be thinking of my brother
4310527 we are immensely proud of our son and know that he lost his life doing something he was proud to be a part of and that he loved

4310529 few people wrote under 100 words some people put tolstoy to shame it seems a lot of people have waited a long time to tell a game developer the answer to this question
4310530 a lot of people cited the cost of games as a major reason for pirating many were kids with no cash and lots of time to play games but many were not
4310531 although there were many and varied complaints about tech support game stability bugs and system requirements it was interesting to hear so many complaints about actual game design and gameplay
4310532 got boring too quickly were too derivative and had gameplay issues
4310533 people dont like drm we knew that but the extent to which drm is turning away people who have no other complaints is possibly misunderstood if you wanted to change one thing to get more pirates to buy games scrapping drm is it
4310534 lots of people claimed to pirate because it was easier than going to shops many of them said they pirate everything thats not on valves steam steam got a pretty universal thumbs up from everyone
4310535 ive gone from being demoralized by pirates to actually inspired by them and im working harder than ever before on making my games fun and polished
4310536 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4310537 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4310538 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4310539 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4310540 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4310541 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4310542 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4310543 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4310544 who are open to doing something on the production side
4310545 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4310546 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4310547 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4310548 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4310549 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4310550 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4310551 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4310552 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4310553 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4310554 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4310555 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4310556 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

4310565 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4310566 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4310567 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4310568 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4310569 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4310570 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4310571 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4310572 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4310573 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4310574 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4310575 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

4310578 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4310579 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

4310583 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4310584 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4310585 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4310586 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4310587 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4310588 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4310589 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4310590 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4310591 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4310592 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4310593 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4310594 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4310595 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4310596 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4310597 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4310598 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4310599 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4310600 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4310601 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4310602 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4310603 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4310604 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4310605 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4310606 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4310607 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4310608 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4310609 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4310610 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4310611 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4310612 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4310613 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4310614 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4310615 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4310616 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4310617 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4310618 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4310619 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4310620 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4310621 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4310622 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4310623 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4310624 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4310625 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4310626 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4310627 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4310628 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4310629 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4310721 it really depends on whats going on with the person and whether or not theyre having severe symptoms
4310722 if theyre not showing severe symptoms we may just start them with natural items people will come in on the medications and well add the nutritional supplements in and sometimes theyll get off the acid blockers altogether
4310723 you would think it wouldnt because its very acidic on its own but lots of people respond to it really well i think it may have something to do with the fact that it helps with digestion and a lot of acid reflux symptoms stem from not digesting food well a lot of times when other things havent worked people find apple cider vinegar does and it can be taken indefinitely

4310725 we are not in this sense members of an organization called society because the society which produces the means for the satisfaction of most our needs is not an organisation directed by a conscious will and could not produce what it does if it were

4310751 both presidents roosevelt were great leaders who looked shrewdly into the future to solve key environmental and energy problems tr of course was the father of the united states forest service and oversaw a slew of environmental back then the popular term was conservation initiatives he also worked to sustain a healthier population with bold efforts to improve working conditions and to upgrade the safety of food and medicine and three decades later fdr tackled energy issues he initiated a vast program of energy producing public works including the tennessee valley authority in addition he started up the rural electrification administration which helped assure an equitable distribution of electricity across the u s a those are both great precedents so why should i choose between them
4310752 both tr and fdr saw that this great country would face huge challenges overseas and so it would have to be ready militarily and economically teddy built the great white fleet and sent it steaming around the world in 1907 9 those battleships surely proved valuable in the world war to come and as for franklin after albert einstein wrote to him on august 2 1939 he put in motion the manhattan project which built the a bomb einsteins prescient letter outlining the enormous potential of nuclear fission was written a month before hitler invaded poland and more than two years before pearl harbor but during the course of the war the commander in chief saw the importance of atomic power even as he mobilized the entire nation for conventional weapons production from jeeps to bombers to aircraft carriers fdrs efforts saved america and they saved the world
4310753 and so once again how could i possibly choose between these two great predecessors i want to draw upon their joint legacy all americans should be proud of both of them
4310754 im always ready to help in any way i can ive committed myself to be a public servant
4310755 id take his call now and id take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
4310756 more energy and cheaper energy in return for cleaner energy much cleaner energy
4310757 you cant solve this problem just with conservation and you cant solve it just with production you need both but you need a robust both a vital center both not a mushy both on these issues its unacceptable to have nothing happen because the extremes on both sides block everything and then call that sort of paralysis a compromise thats not compromise thats defeat we need to do better cleaner smarter
4310758 and i think the stakes now are higher even than that this isnt just about jobs and the environment here at home this is about the world balance of power the iranians and the russians and the venezuelans badly behaved as they are have received in effect enormous pay raises because of our collective gluttony for imported oil how can we convince ahmadinejad or putin or chavez that they are on a wrong course when all they see is that their oil and natural gas revenues have tripled in the last couple years
4310759 i want to change that i have been reading a book from a decade or so ago by peter schweizer victory the reagan administrations secret strategy that hastened the collapse of the soviet union and it details how reagan and his team figured out how in effect to economically blockade the soviets driving down oil prices from 40 a barrel when reagan took office to as low as 10 a barrel can you imagine what would happen to russia and iran and venezuela if oil prices fell back down to those levels and what would happen to al qaeda if its wahabi paymasters all went broke
4310760 arnold i dont want you to come here and be merely bureaucrat here for a couple of years and then being run out of town i want you to be a transformative leader able to tap into all the talent and wealth and patriotism that this country has to offer so that we can really do the things i was elected to do here at home provide good jobs at good wages plus health care as well as clean up the environment and regain the upper hand in our international dealings i see all these things as connected and i see you arnold as the key to making all this work
4310761 sir i could never turn you down and i could never turn america down we have a lot of details to work out so that the energy and environment czar can truly be effective but i am confident that working with congress we can get this done
4310762 we have a lot of money in this country what we dont have enough of is security and sustainability happily we can buy that
4310763 i have plenty of my own money nobody buys me i know where boone is coming from and thats why i want him here beside me where i can keep an eye on him i want the best and more to the point the american people want the best
4310764 with apologies to fdr better the occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of experimentation than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference
4310765 these problems are bigger than any person or any party so we must work together
4310766 we are not going to let those special interests terminate our effort
4310767 the presidents roosevelt strategy has put us on a course toward a cleaner and more secure future
4310768 ive had real good workouts these last few days probably my best ones of the season
4310769 im feeling quicker and stronger right now so im looking forward to getting going on monday im real antsy anxious now so its time to go compete
4310770 really im so excited to be back in the olympics
4310771 you know the previous olympics were fantastic for me i really enjoyed them but most importantly this is the one ive been looking forward to
4310772 i think its going to be a really great final
4310773 and also its a lot different from 2004 when i came in as an 18 year old i was just i didnt know what to expect and i was all about enjoying the experience and as i come back this time its all about business ive waited four years to have a rematch and im not taking it lightly
4310774 to come back to the next olympics and to be the favorite and leaving with a gold medal in my main event would mean so much to me
4310775 it would mean that all my sacrifices and hard work have paid off
4310776 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4310777 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4310778 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4310779 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4310780 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4310781 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4310782 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4310783 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4310784 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4310785 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4310786 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4310787 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4310788 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4310789 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4310790 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair

4310794 they must roll into a fast food restaurant and look for fast food grease to turn into eco friendly fuel will this battle include discussion of the efficacy of biofuels as a long term petroleum substitute or the possible argument that biofuels are a crime against humanity
4310795 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people
4310796 have got golden opportunity to use their public profile to shine a light on these issues and get people to engage in their everyday lifestyle
4310797 the idea is if they can do it so can we
4310798 to see that celebrities and directors were driving the car that gave the car a cool vibe instead of a nerdy little weird car vibe
4310799 people take their fashion and style messages from celebrities why wont they also take their environmental messages
4310800 i dont know if theres time to go door to door and show people
4310801 thats why its good to have this celebrity platform anyone who uses their celebrity this podium responsibly im all for it

4310807 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4310808 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4310809 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4310810 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4310811 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4310812 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4310813 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4310814 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4310815 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4310816 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4310817 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights

4310852 fifty fifty maksudnya sekilo daging ayam dicampur dengan sekilo daging kuda
4310853 begini saya mencurigai istri saya ada main dengan lelaki lain saya putuskan untuk pulang lebih awal hari itu ke apartemen saya yg ada di lantai 25 dan seperti yang saya duga tampaknya ada yang tidak beres saat itu mulailah saya berkeliling mencari si hidung belang akhirnya saya temukan sang hidung belang sedang bergelantungan di balkoni saya saya marah dan memukul jari jari sang hidung belang saya ambil palu dan pukulkan ke tangan dia akhirnya dia jatuh ternyata dia bernasib baik dia jatuh di rerumputan yang lebat dan selamat saya tidak tahan lagi saya ambil lemari es dan lempar barang itu tepat di atas badan si hidung belang sesudah itu saya terkena serangan jantung dan mati
4310854 hari ini hari yg sangat aneh buat saya saya tinggal di lantai 26 dan latihan pagi tiap harinya
4310855 begini bayangkan ini saya meringkuk kedinginan di lemari es dan telanjang dan

4310863 pa diantara ke 4 ptn ini yang mana yang alumnusnya terkenal cepet dapet kerja
4310864 trus jadinya paling cepet dapet kerja kalo kuliah di itb dong pa
4310865 oh salah itu nak bu mega yang ga selesain sarjananya di unpad bisa jadi presiden tuh
4310866 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4310867 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4310868 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4310869 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4310870 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4310871 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4310872 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4310873 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4310874 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4310875 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4310876 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4310877 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4310878 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4310879 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4310880 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4310881 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4310882 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4310883 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4310884 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4310885 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4310886 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4310887 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4310888 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4310889 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4310890 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4310891 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4310892 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4310893 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4310894 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4310895 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4310896 he implied he had a weapon but none was observed
4310897 its something that were going to look at the fbis going to look at and investigate any similarities to any recent crimes
4310898 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4310899 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4310900 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4310901 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4310902 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4310903 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4310904 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4310905 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4310906 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4310907 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4310908 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4310909 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4310910 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4310911 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4310912 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4310913 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4310914 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4310915 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4310916 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4310917 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4310918 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4310919 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4310920 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4310921 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4310922 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4310923 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4310924 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4310925 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4310926 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4310927 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4310928 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4310929 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4310930 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4310931 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4310932 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4310933 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4310934 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4310935 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4310936 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4310937 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4310938 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4310939 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4310940 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4310941 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4310942 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4310943 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4310944 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4310945 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4310946 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4310947 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4310948 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4310949 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4310950 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4310951 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4310952 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4310953 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4310954 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4310955 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4310956 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4310957 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4310958 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4310959 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4310960 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4310961 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4310962 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4310963 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4310964 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4310965 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4310966 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4310967 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4310968 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4310969 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4310970 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4310971 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4310972 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4310973 who will be the next president of the united states
4310974 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4310975 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4310976 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4310977 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4310978 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
4310979 it doesnt matter which one is president there is going to be a tremendous need for lobbying
4310980 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4310981 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4310982 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4310983 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4310984 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4310985 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4310986 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4310987 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4310988 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4310989 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4310990 billof rights there is a mountain of evidence that bush is incompetent
4310991 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4310992 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4310993 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4310994 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4310995 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4310996 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4310997 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4310998 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4310999 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4311000 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4311001 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4311002 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4311003 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4311004 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4311005 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4311006 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4311007 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4311008 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4311009 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4311010 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4311011 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4311012 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4311013 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4311014 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4311015 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4311016 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4311017 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4311018 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4311019 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4311020 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4311021 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4311022 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4311023 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4311024 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4311025 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4311026 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4311027 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4311028 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4311029 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4311030 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4311031 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4311032 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4311033 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4311034 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4311035 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4311036 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4311037 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4311038 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4311039 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4311040 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4311041 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4311042 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4311043 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4311044 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4311045 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4311046 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4311047 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4311048 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4311049 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4311050 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4311051 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
4311052 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4311053 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4311054 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4311055 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4311056 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4311057 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4311058 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4311059 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4311060 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4311061 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4311062 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4311063 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4311064 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4311065 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4311066 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4311067 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4311068 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4311069 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4311070 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4311071 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4311072 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4311073 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4311074 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4311075 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4311076 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4311077 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4311078 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4311079 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4311080 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4311081 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4311082 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4311083 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4311084 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4311085 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4311086 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4311087 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4311088 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4311089 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4311090 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4311091 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4311092 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4311093 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4311094 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4311095 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4311096 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4311097 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
4311098 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
4311099 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
4311100 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
4311101 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4311102 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4311103 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4311104 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4311105 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4311106 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4311107 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
4311108 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
4311109 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4311110 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
4311111 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
4311112 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
4311113 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
4311114 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
4311115 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
4311116 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
4311117 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4311118 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4311119 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4311120 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4311121 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4311122 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4311123 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4311124 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4311125 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4311126 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
4311127 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
4311128 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4311129 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
4311130 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
4311131 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4311132 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4311133 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4311134 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4311135 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4311136 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4311137 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4311138 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4311139 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
4311140 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
4311141 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
4311142 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
4311143 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
4311144 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
4311145 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
4311146 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
4311147 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
4311148 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living

4311175 obviously senator obama is putting an awful lot of money into virginia both on the ground and on television and it is a state that has elected democrats recently
4311176 but its one we take very seriously and one we think still leans for us and one we will fight for every single day
4311177 basically you are looking at an even race in virginia
4311178 but we think mccain is a republican who matches up very well in virginia
4311179 they are now seeing the same things we are seeing which is it is really close in virginia
4311180 we are making a strong effort there and we are making that strong effort because we absolutely believe that virginia is in play

4311207 humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives it stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities it is not theistic and it does not accept supernatural views of reality

4311456 the guy who threw the grenade was always at the top of the list
4311457 if there is one issue that should have been taken to the united nations security council or the international court of justice it is that of missing pakistanis
4311458 the political arm of the government was controlling much of the process through the legal adviser
4311459 the judicial system that bows to political pressures is not a system that an objective observer can have any confidence in
4311460 if we didnt get the military commission up and running and get the public behind it it would implode cases like khadrs were going to bring political support and make it harder for the next commander in chief to stop the process
4311461 mi esperanza es que estos acuerdos ayuden a los supervivientes y a sus familias a comenzar a recuperarse y seguir adelante
4311462 hoy me disculpo nuevamente con los supervivientes y sus familias y con toda la comunidad cat lica debemos continuar haciendo todo lo que est en nuestro poder para garantizar la seguridad de los ni os bajo nuestro cuidado
4311463 la publicaci n de su testimonio de george hoy es un paso significativo hacia la apertura y transparencia y ayuda a los supervivientes y a la comunidad eclesi stica a sanar y recuperarse
4311464 if we didnt get the military commission up and running and get the public behind it it would implode cases like khadrs were going to bring political support and make it harder for the next commander in chief to stop the process
4311465 the kind of case the publics going to get energized about
4311466 the influence that expedited the charging of khadr came from jim haynes
4311467 it was very very clear that this was a political process from day one
4311468 i dont think the judges are sufficiently independent and i dont think theyre sufficiently insulated from political control to render independent rulings
4311469 im hopeful somethings going to happen and that the canadian governments going to intervene
4311470 this is a good move since it will be much easier for the family to visit him
4311471 he is now currently in assir prison which is located close to the yemeni border and causes more hardship for the family when they go to visit him all the way there
4311472 hopefully this will be a step forward in releasing mr al murbati which we hope will happen before ramadan
4311473 he is bahraini he was born and raised in bahrain but got a uae passport when his father moved and lived there for a while
4311474 since he has a uae passport bahrain is not responsible for him but as human rights activists the society will continue to take up his case and secure his release
4311475 but if you look at it this way what were doing is crazy
4311476 i realized what a nice thing it would be if the policeman and the dogs could have recognition for all the time they spend in training and all the protection they offer the community that goes unnoticed
4311477 thats why i volunteered to paint the first dog and donate it to the south ogden police department
4311478 everybody out there is suffering right now everybodys talking about raising water sewer gas you know the story so we wanted to do everything we could to keep it low

4311482 we were told within weeks of getting there that the geneva conventions dont apply
4311483 the concern wasnt just that they didnt apply but now that you dont have those guidelines then what are the new guidelines which by the way we werent trained on
4311484 inside the wire a military intelligence soldiers eyewitness account of life at guantanamo
4311485 its not just that what we were doing was wrong but was completely ineffective
4311486 once they feel that you have tortured people sexually humiliated them mistreated the symbols of religion those people will not come to you
4311487 she is a very nice person a very gentle person easygoing everything she says is consistent with the truth
4311488 im sure its true if theyve got some evidence of what they claim lets see it instead theyre providing the press with unnamed anonymous sources
4311489 and shes suddenly picked up carrying a grab bag of terrorist goodies
4311490 please presume her innocent lets show that weve got a decent system of justice
4311491 her degree is in education not biochemistry her lab in brandeis was just a bunch of computers they are just wrong about her background
4311492 youve got to do what you think is right i dont believe shes a terrorist

4311512 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
4311513 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
4311514 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
4311515 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed
4311516 this is the place i come to share my stories thoughts prayers battles struggles and victories as a christian mom
4311517 thanks to the help and prayers of everyone inside and outside the hospital and all over the world we once again have triumphed over this trial

4311532 das tolle an einem irrenhaus als schauplatz ist dass man seiner fantasie v llig freien lauf lassen und so die verr cktesten einf lle verwirklichen kann
4311533 wir wissen dass die spieler schon lange auf eine fortsetzung der serie gewartet haben wir freuen uns also sehr sie heute zum ersten mal unseren spielern hier in paris und denen auf der ganzen welt pr sentieren zu d rfen
4311534 in unserem spiel geht es um zug nglichkeit und spa
4311535 und nicht darum alle paar sekunden von einem 15 j hrigen platt gemacht zu werden der all die guten waffen hat weil er den ganzen tag ber nichts anderes macht als spielen
4311536 dabei geht es vor allem um eines um spa ich denke dass wir mit dem neuen design dieser tatsache sehr viel mehr gerecht werden
4311537 wir haben festgestellt dass die meisten spieler ohnehin nur einige wenige maps in einem mp shooter wirklich spielen der rest ist meist nur vorhanden um eine m glichst gro e zahl auf die packung schreiben zu k nnen
4311538 daher wollen wir diese zum release in bester qualit t abliefern und weitere karten im monatlichen abstand hinterher schieben f r diejenigen die noch mehr wollen
4311539 sicher sind wir uns bewusst dass wir an 95 der spieler von battlefield heroes nie einen cent verdienen werden
4311540 wer einfach nur spielen will der spielt und wem es nicht gef llt der deinstalliert es eben wieder f r die brigen 5 werden wir aber eine ganze menge cooler sachen in petto haben
4311541 this is a premier guy leader player take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
4311542 as a player you have to be very careful about dotting all your is and crossing all your ts before you do anything else
4311543 i take pride in that im going to do everything i can to be the best player i can be on the field before i do anything else
4311544 im not going to sacrifice what i can do on the field for marketing opportunities or other different things
4311545 and thats something i probably need to work on trying to find that balance as long as my play continues to get better maybe i can find a way to reconsider some of those offers
4311546 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
4311547 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
4311548 the focus is not there it is on football and other sports
4311549 a lot of kids play basketball at a young age but as they get older the attention and the facilities are not there so they go in a different direction
4311550 i believe the game is growing here in the uk which is going to help a lot of kids with a lot of talent so hopefully theyll have a brighter future

4311552 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4311553 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4311554 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4311555 umpires tend to be intimated by john which generally means they are more lenient with him he crossed the line today
4311556 the only thing it appears they can do is to either overpay for a couple of big free agents or trade jake peavy for a bunch of prospects what else can they do
4311557 the clear language of the artistic license creates conditions to protect the economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license these conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package
4311558 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration
4311559 there are substantial benefits including economic benefits to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge similarly a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects
4311560 so far ahead of everybody else it was almost laughable
4311561 to be honest with you i dont think ive ever seen anything more spectacular than the performance they put on in the pool thats what the olympics are about for me going out and watching greatness its fun
4311562 having those guys here is pretty special you can kind of hear them starting cheers and getting everybody going its pretty neat

4311581 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4311582 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4311583 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4311584 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4311585 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4311586 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4311587 in dreams i talk to you in dreams youre mine all of

4311594 it sounds so silly i want him to want me more i want him i dont know to be man enough to take the initiative
4311595 it doesnt sound silly maybe a bit girly but not silly
4311596 i dont think i could do it sit there frustrated for seven years the way he does frightened of what
4311597 why do you care you didnt come just to ask me that did you
4311598 im curious is all if you dont want to tell me dont you know i dont care
4311599 i dont know why you set out to seduce me in the first place or why you come back
4311600 i dont know why you dont call the cops the minute i break into your house
4311601 its a recurrent nightmare i want despite myself its the hell i punish myself with
4311602 do you come here just to ruin me in your head you told me i was beautiful once so beautiful you couldnt stand it
4311603 everythings beautiful if you look at it the right way
4311604 youre such a philosopher when youre trying to get in my pants are you really here to talk
4311605 youre still beautiful but that doesnt mean things will change because i think so
4311606 i probably shouldnt say this but at times i get so scared when i think about the previous relationship we shared
4311607 mauk filed a lawsuit wednesday against the ncaa less than a week after the association rejected his final appeal for another year of eligibility at cincinnati the same day the lawsuit was filed hardin county judge william hart in mauks home area of kenton ohio granted a temporary restraining order that says the ncaa cannot prevent him from practicing with the bearcats mauk was a key player as cincinnati rose to college footballs top 25 last season he says he should get another season because of playing time lost to injury while he was at wake forest
4311608 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4311609 nicola paige was talking about you nicola paige shes a superstar
4311610 well she said you were a mistake for our team
4311611 and made an unstoppable army of midgets until the sexy assassin elsha hawk seemed to switch sides killing the midgets and bart all in one process now heres where it gets confusing
4311612 just bear with me a moment sir mask stovo and band baby all emerged unscathed but band baby was by barts dead body and even though mask was on barts side she seemed to be surprised that her ahem sister was with him elsha having apparently gone completely insane turned against her former partner stovo and questioned mask if they were on her side or not
4311613 yes mr president i agree but she can break your face in half and then put lead through it
4311614 now mr president anyhow like i said its all very confusing hopefully ahem that is
4311615 so sir you can understand how confusing this all really is
4311616 i probably shouldnt say this but at times i get so scared when i think about the previous relationship we shared
4311617 clark gregg choke director knew that id written choke while listening to radioheads 1993 debut album pablo honey with creep over and over and over
4311618 so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits
4311619 so sir you can understand how confusing this all really is
4311620 it seems that now this new order of awesomeness is indeed americas biggest threat
4311621 yeah look read this article i found http www asylum com 2008 07 24 paranoia alert bears hunting scientists and other humans seems that stephen colbert was right all along
4311622 ok so maybe bears are still 1 threat to america but this loa could be climbing the ranks to
4311623 transform our community and our world with the gospel of jesus christ

4311635 the public doesnt want to know about process and 60 votes they want outcomes they want results
4311636 whether its the deficit or the challenges to the constitution we have to dig our way out
4311637 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today
4311638 who gave you the right to take the constitution and shove it down the toilet who gave you the right to take impeachment off the table nobody told them to do this

4311643 i try to promote bipartisanship but thats not what the other side wants
4311644 if you have on a fine suit you dont want to fold it up and put it through that machine
4311645 i think there is generally an incentive to be more casual im more inclined to dress down there has been a continual degradation of any fashion sense in the past decade you cant believe what youre seeing
4311646 screeners do have some discretion and can refer a passenger to additional screening if they notice any irregularity to a passengers contour or if it appears there is an item protruding underneath their clothing

4311648 a lot of people have been settling for second instead of wanting to beat hoy
4311649 but everyone has weak points and im going to try to find them
4311650 the race is not only about the favorites half the field starting the points race could medal

4311655 its a little bit uncertain how the race will unfold and who will be the top rivals but i feel 100 percent
4311656 i dont like setting targets i think really the major target is going to be staying in the premier league
4311657 obviously wed like to improve considerably from what we did last year but i dont want to quantify that by saying this place or that place
4311658 ill see how the season pans out and see how good we can be and then maybe start setting definite targets during the course of the season
4311659 weve signed players and we are happy with the signings we think that it has made us stronger as a unit
4311660 its a new team it might take a bit of time for certain positions to bed in but i have been very happy with the way people have been working in the pre season i have been very happy with the pre season results
4311661 he had a thigh strain when he arrived from everton and we dont want to take the risk by playing him too early im pretty sure he will be able to play against arsenal on aug 23 but well have to do without him at hull
4311662 i think with the quality we have got we are capable of pushing for mid table i think it would be realistically a good achievement for us

4311852 this type of win is whats been happening since early in the season when we started win a lot of games late

4311873 indeed a major burden was removed from the shoulders of believers when convincing evidence was advanced that the design of organisms need not be attributed to the immediate agency of the creator but rather is an outcome of natural processes

4312043 two points are sacrosanct for germany the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks

4312050 if there is an indictment of the president of the sudan how can the international community hold sudan responsible for the protection of the many international bodies that are working in darfur
4312051 there is no way we can accept that an international force that we dont command stays in darfur with a warrant of arrest on our president
4312052 we will not give visas we may even withdraw visas if we say darfur has become a contested territory between us and the icc we can only look after the security of the territory and not the security of international personnel

4312055 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
4312056 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds

4312058 setting the minimum marriage age at 18 has been a proposal since 2000 but the yemeni parliaments islamic sharia codification committee has not yet presented the amendments to parliament for discussion
4312059 but amendments to the law in 1999 made it unclear and the law now fails to mention an exact minimum age for marriage it only authorises the girls guardian to decide whether she is physically and psychologically prepared for marriage
4312060 but there are extreme groups in society and in parliament which are against amending the law
4312061 hormone and physical changes which confuse her body growth and affect her health in the long and medium term

4312065 when a new kadima party chairman is chosen i will resign as prime minister to permit them to put together a new government swiftly and effectively
4312066 i want to make it clear i am proud to be a citizen of a country where the prime minister can be investigated like a regular citizen
4312067 it is the duty of the police to investigate and the duty of the prosecution to instruct the police the prime minister is not above the law
4312068 i will step aside properly in an honourable and responsible way and afterwards i will prove my innocence
4312069 these marriages usually end up in failure and the girl usually goes through trauma due to living with a man who is much older

4312071 our intelligence information indicates the withdrawal of certain groups of al qaida from iraq because of the military strikes many of them have escaped through the borders with syria and iran to hotter zones such as somalia and sudan
4312072 i believe this is the beginning of the complete withdrawal of al qaida from iraqi territory
4312073 this also highlights the increasingly improving performance of the iraqi armed forces and the speed by which they can operate in different places
4312074 al qaida began to lose a lot of sympathy on the sunni streets after realising that al maliki government launched a war against the shiites fighters believed to be backed by iran

4312094 it is vital that a species with such a limited distribution is not further compromised
4312095 this is most likely due to shrinking of their habitat and vegetation by foxes and local dogs
4312096 if we keep nibbling away at this last large piece of remnant vegetation in the city council area what other species are we going to lose from the area
4312097 it can support a number of species and maintain genetic diversity of those species
4312098 most other remnants within the city are too small to remain viable in the long term without considerable inputs and ongoing management
4312099 i believe it is a significant community asset for amenity recreation open space and to provide habitat for many threatened and declining species
4312100 enjoying nature so close to the residential areas of the city is a legitimate use of the area for our community and future generations
4312101 i would rather see them entertain the thought of a bridge im assuming they have not done that because of the cost

4312123 s lo que se me ocurri que obviamente era mejor que el asesino pudiera ejercitar su libre voluntad en lugar de restringirla lamento profundamente las elecciones que hizo pero se es el precio de tener un mundo con agentes libres acaso preferir as que todos los humanos de este mundo fueran robots las elecciones libres del atacante no estaban ciertamente bajo mi control as que no se sostiene que se me responsabilice por sus acciones
4312124 mi motivaci n fue un poco diferente estaba a punto usar mi arma contra el asesino cuando pens pero espera no ser a una oportunidad perfecta para todo aquel que estuviera caminando cerca y de forma que alguna persona presente y desarmada pudiera ejercitar un hero smo desinteresado si interviniera en todo momento como estaba apunto de hacer nadie podr a ejercitar esta virtud de hecho si previniera cada acto de violaci n y de asesinato la gente se volver a muy egoc ntrica y se echar a a perder
4312125 probablemente lo habr a hecho si yo no tuviera la experiencia que tengo de la vida como un todo por supuesto partiendo de que la violaci n y asesinato de la se orita k parece horrible si lo tomamos como un hecho aislado pero cuando usted pone los hechos en el contexto de la globalidad de la vida se agrega realmente a la belleza total de ese gran cuadro los gritos de la se orita k eran como las notas discordantes que hacen mejores a piezas musicales excelentes que no lo ser an si todas las notas se hubieran dado sin defectos de hecho apenas pod a contenerme de hacer movimientos ondulantes con mis manos e imagin ndome que yo mismo conduc a los matices deliciosos de la orquesta
4312126 cuando llegu a la escena saqu el arma y apunt a la cabeza del violador
4312127 estoy profundamente avergonzado de haber hecho eso sabes lo cerca que estuve de destruir toda la bondad del mundo lo que quiero decir es que todo el mundo sabe que no puede haber un bien sin mal afortunadamente record esto justo a tiempo y tuve una fuerte sensanci n nauseosa cuando me di cuenta lo que casi hab a hecho tanto que se me estremicieron mis manos y rodillas estuve muy cerca
4312128 mire realmente no estoy como para intentar explicarte los detalles
4312129 hay una raz n excelente de porqu no intervine pero es muy complicada para la puedas entender as que no me voy a molestar en intentarlo lo que quiero decir es que t mismo admites que no est s ni remotamente cerca de mi capacidad de comprensi n qu derecho tienes t en juzgarme no hay ning n malentendido en todo este asunto y d jame precisar que nadie podr a cuidar de la se orita k m s de lo que yo lo hice y que soy de hecho una persona muy buena esto lo deja claro
4312130 pero simplemente no era factible f jese que yo quisiera que todos eligieran libremente creer en m pero si yo interfiera cada vez que alguien estuviera a punto de ser violada o ser asesinada la evidencia de que estoy entre ellos ser a tan clara que todos se ver an forzados a creer en m puede usted imaginar una infracci n m s diab lica sobre el libre albedr o de las personas obviamente fue mejor que retrocediera y dejara que la se orita k fuera violada y asesinada ahora todos pueden elegir libremente creer o no que existe este polic a extraordinario que los ama como a sus propios hijos
4312131 justamente evit que una mujer la semana pasada fuera violada y asesinada tengo que saltar e intervenir cada vez que veo algo similar sucede alrededor en realidad el hecho de que no haya m s mujeres violadas y asesinadas en esta ciudad es casi un testimonio milagroso de mi bondad
4312132 momentos despu s de que la se orita k llegara a su fin yo la resucit y vol a una zona tur stica tropical donde ahora est experimentando una dicha extraordinaria la dura prueba que pas es s lo una recuerdo distante en su memoria estoy seguro que estar s de acuerdo en que es una recompensa adecuada al sufrimiento que pas por tanto el hecho de que yo estuviera ah mirando en lugar de intervenir no afecta en absoluto a mi bondad
4312133 yo la dise gen ticamente a ella desde cero la fabriqu y por lo tanto ella es de mi propiedad y puedo hacer lo que desee con ella podr a violarla y asesinarla yo mismo si estuviera esa inclinaci n y eso no ser a peor que cuando t partes un papel que es tuyo por tanto no tiene sentido decir que soy mala persona por no ayudarla
4312134 lo contrat para crear a la se orita k para m porque quer a que alguien me amara y que adorara pero cuando suger este asunto a la se orita k ella se apart realmente lejos de m como si pudiera encontrar un significado y felicidad con alg n otro decid que la cosa m s bondadosa que pod a hacer era desgarrar su esp ritu disponiendo que fuera violada y asesinada por un delincuente com n de modo que en su sufrimiento extraordinario volviera hacia a m satisfaciendo el prop sito para el cual la hab an creado bien me complazco en decir misi n lograda algunos segundos antes de que muriera estaba tan enloquecida por el terror y el dolor que se convenci realmente de que me amaba porque sab a que s lo yo pod a terminar su dura prueba nunca me olvidar del amor que reflejaban sus ojos cuando miraba para arriba y hacia m en sus ltimos momentos suplicando misericordia justo antes de que el delincuente se inclinara sobre ella y le cortara la garganta fue tan hermoso que todav a me vienen l grimas ahora tengo justamente que ir a la isla donde pedir el precio por su servidumbre
4312135 parece el delincuente consigui paga doble porque le contrat para realizar el asesinato tambi n por qu oh era s lo una prueba la se orita k y yo hab amos estado cit ndonos durante alg n tiempo no se ofendan no sab a que fuera propiedad de alguien m s y una hermosa noche ella finalmente me dijo que me amaba as pues como es natural dese ver si era verdadero amor es decir si ella continuar a ador ndome incluso mientras que se ahogaba en una piscina de sus propias l grimas y sangre conmigo de pie delante de ella y sin hacer nada
4312136 a prop sito pienso que tambi n debes saber que cuando est bamos parados all mirando a la se orita k siendo violada y apu alada repetidamente nosotros sufr amos junto con ella y experimentabamos exactamente el mismo dolor que padeci o quiz s a n m s

4312150 yes i can see how this can be a big decision you know i found that typically my clients are initially concerned with one of the three things is the problem important enough to solve it now is this the right solution for your situation can you afford the solution which one of those concerns you the most
4312151 hmmm i see let me ask you lets say we get started on this project what are the downsides
4312152 great what kinds of questions do you think they might they ask
4312153 good idea i always discuss decisions like this with my partner or spouse but let me ask you a question what will you do when your partner doesnt like the idea of us moving forward with this
4312154 yes its a sold investment i tell you what i know this is only worthwhile if you produce solid results right whats the one result you would want to be absolutely sure we could produce in the next month months six days 90 that would have you really happy you hired me great why dont we make this our top priority and get started right away
4312155 not really how does this price compare to what its costing you to do nothing about this problem
4312156 hmmmm how long have you been dealing with this issue if you havent solved it on your own so far what makes you think you can do it now
4312157 yes i suppose you could but let me ask you something when was the last time you saw heard of a heart surgeon performing an open heart surgery on himself
4312158 with all the respect i must disagree if you thought you could solve this problem on your own we wouldnt be talking right now tell me how would things be different if you could rely on an unbiased opinion to give you a fresh perspective of this problem
4312159 yes it will take some time to address this issue how much more time per week could you devote to other revenue generating activities if you could eliminate dealing with this problem on ongoing bases
4312160 thats funny you just told me it takes you 10 hours a week to deal with this problem wouldnt it make sense to hire someone like myself and solve it so that you can use your time on more productive tasks

4312420 our state now recognizes that an individuals capacity to establish a loving and long term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individuals sexual orientation

4312423 i do not have a problem with the gay sailors who do not flaunt their sexuality
4312424 i honestly feel that the bulk of society is not very accepting of the lifestyle
4312425 so how do you get society in general to want to get off of that line of thinking

4312449 i looked at the boys and said go inside and call your moms because the day was over it was time to go
4312450 that made him very angry he began from that point on to get more angry and furious
4312451 i wasnt under arrest hed beaten me up in front of my kids we were terrified
4312452 i was looking at 15 years that could have gone to prison because of this
4312453 hes had more complaints lodged against him than any police officer ive ever seen
4312454 he truly is one of the most dangerous people that ive come across doing this
4312455 he applied to be a police officer at the louisville police department and when they did his background investigation he didnt pass muster so they didnt hire him
4312456 when strathmoor village hired him they did a 15 minute interview in the parking lot then gave him a badge and a gun
4312457 before you strap a badge and a gun on an individual whos a loose cannon and give him the ability to send people to the penitentiary you better check out who youre dealing with first
4312458 this really did happen and its happened to other people not just me
4312459 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe

4312462 to the extent that the faa and the department of transportation begin to turn their policy drive more toward expanding capacity and yes making significant investments in a next generation air traffic control system and changes of that nature it would show a great deal more flexibility in terms of what we think our appropriate operational measures are in the interim
4312463 it is very encouraging we have worked closely with the port authority in the past and i cant see why we cant agree on a common approach
4312464 the favorite is australia but im beginning to think the u s might beat them

4312484 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4312485 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4312486 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4312501 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
4312502 for centuries our educational system has led us to approach scripture as a silent text that you are to read and understand and that is far different from hearing a story in a traditional service the scripture reading is time to take a quick nap with the storytelling approach you dont take a nap
4312503 this tournament is known to be a very tough one and we have only managed to win one gold medal here since we started to send participants in 2003 usually we only win a few silver or a few bronze each year in previous years but now we have 49 honors and all our representatives each won an honor for the country
4312504 we should promote this interest this love for mathematics not just to win trophies and medals in international tournaments but to pave the way for students to go into engineering and science and technology courses our country needs engineers and scientists

4312512 he cares about his on court performance more than he ever has in his life
4312513 whatever adelman needs me to do come off the bench be the sixth or seventh man start i dont even care whatever he needs me to do im 100 percent sure its going to work
4312514 this guy really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4312515 we have a great team to start on the floor and a bench i think were going to go really far
4312516 i didnt think about the streak until i started walking back on the mound
4312517 the first thought that popped in my head was i cant believe that just happened with a runner on first but i guess the good thing it wasnt a cheap one a whole bunch of things fell at once and so that way theres no pressure from this point on
4312518 its almost been like a no hitter type streak or something
4312519 unbelievable what hes done but ill get him right back out and try to start another one hes been tremendous
4312520 there were many many moments where momentum shifted and we were able to stay focused stay poised and come out of some tough situations
4312521 eventually we were able to put some runs on the board but the key was being able to stay in the present and not letting that shift of momentum affect our approach at the plate and on the mound its a great win for us because it was quite difficult
4312522 this type of win is whats been happening since early in the season when we started win a lot of games late
4312523 weve got our confidence up and we believe as long as we go on that field weve got a chance to win
4312524 its exactly what were looking for beyond everything else is the continuous maximum effort it was tremendous i loved it
4312525 i just want to not have to go through this again
4312526 its hard you cant go out and do anything you have to find things to do that dont cost any money its hard on your psyche to be living like this
4312527 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4312528 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4312529 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4312530 god grant me the serenity to accept the things we cannot change
4312531 alright i did this to myself it stole a piece of me i never intended on losing and now i need to get over it and not look back
4312532 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4312533 as a matter of policy we do not discuss current or future ships movements however i can tell you that reports of an alleged naval blockade of iran are false
4312534 we routinely rotate deployed naval forces in the uscentcom area of responsibility
4312535 i knew when i was here before that this team was going to be something special
4312536 and that was something i wanted to be a part of and help them build unfortunately i wasnt there for part of the building aspect but i thought that if i could help out in any way then this was where i needed to be
4312537 but i do know that hes a fast tough kid that just wants to get on the field any way he can
4312538 put him on four special teams he can really help on special teams because hes big hes 220 pounds hes fast hes physical
4312539 special teams if they need me to do one thing or the other im going to do whatever i can to help this team
4312540 the university of washington is a great school academically and the football program is top notch a nationally recognized and renowned program so i just thought it was a good situation to be a part of
4312541 the freshmen here are playing like sophomores and juniors in a lot of i aa programs i would say everything is about one step faster in all aspects of the game but its a learning curve like anything else and i believe ill be able to handle it
4312542 some of my best games were in december the playoff game against the washington redskins i had a strong performance
4312543 the coaches work with us as far as practice and giving us reps off
4312544 but having another talented defensive lineman will never hurt you guys get hurt and defensive line is an exhausting position to play and having more guys to come in and make plays is beneficial
4312545 patrick is our leader in sacks but he did wear down because he plays the game hard all the time
4312546 and he did wear down to the point where against green bay he was hurt pretty good and he still played if we can avoid that by taking some of the snaps away from him as long as the next guy can come in and play thats what were looking at right now
4312547 when i get the adrenaline going i dont like watching
4312548 taking snaps off early in a game can be helpful maybe take off a series in the first quarter and one in the second that can pay off in the second half and hopefully make you more productive
4312549 i want to be consistent down in and down out game in and game out
4312550 give me a desk and a tv and decent chair and nice fields and thats really what we get used to
4312551 so in that respect this place is very comfortable the one thing i will not miss is the bubble or the moldy smell or anything that went with that like the darkness

4312555 i dont see them changing their policy to get western approval
4312556 they have no need to change anything they do in foreign policy to make themselves look good
4312557 once it was in the air that the olympics could be affected by these issues they had to sit down and think much more concentratedly about each of them
4312558 they didnt want to be out of step with the african union on the question of sudan not wanting to appear as a colonialist power but a cooperative one
4312559 i have to see if your heart is bumping mama
4312560 i am not surprised to see a breakthrough of 800 now and i guess whats coming into play now is more technical selling below 800
4312561 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4312562 i think investors are changing their views on all commodities sentiment is of course very bearish
4312563 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
4312564 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing a complex trait as anxiety
4312565 we meant to make the mistake we were just trying to show a generic skyline to give the impression of urban regeneration

4312569 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4312570 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4312571 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4312572 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4312573 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4312574 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4312575 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4312576 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4312577 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4312578 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4312579 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4312580 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4312581 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4312582 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4312583 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4312584 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4312585 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4312586 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4312587 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4312588 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4312589 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4312590 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4312591 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4312592 if you look at a stealth game its about being weak and hiding this is about being in a strong positions and them not knowing where you are its a very different fell

4312594 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
4312595 the study has a very pro exercise message if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
4312596 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
4312597 this research re confirms the clear benefits of regular exercise for older people
4312598 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep
4312599 it is the biggest opportunity i have ever had playing basketball
4312600 this guy really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4312601 we have a great team to start on the floor and bench
4312602 it is as if they are trying to foment a floor fight at the convention

4312608 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
4312609 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
4312610 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4312611 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4312612 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4312613 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4312614 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4312615 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4312616 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4312617 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4312618 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4312619 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4312620 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4312621 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4312622 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4312623 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4312624 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4312625 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4312626 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4312627 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4312628 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4312629 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4312630 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4312631 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4312632 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4312633 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4312634 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4312635 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4312636 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4312637 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4312638 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4312639 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4312640 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

4312653 theres no place in this area right now where the children can go to have recreation and thats one of the things i believe that the city should do come in so that we can have recreation for the children

4312657 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4312658 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4312659 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4312660 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4312661 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4312662 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4312663 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4312664 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4312665 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4312666 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4312667 who can guess that precise moment when your world is going to change
4312668 we had worked hard our entire lives and if this was all the insurance we had we could become homeless
4312669 from a male point of view you want to be able to fix things you want to be able to provide

4312712 lets do what we want to do and then simply talk about it in their language and ideas
4312713 since in their worldview they do not think what we are doing is possible they will think we are doing what they want us to be doing because we are talking their language we will be left alone to do exactly what we want to do right under their noses they will be happy and we will be happy without there being any need for confrontation soon they will discover that we are growing and they are not because they are stuck standing there watching us
4312714 how can we do this in a way which works fully for those in the enterprise and those in the community rather than for one more than the other
4312715 if these ideas are true what kind of an organization does it suggest
4312716 work is the means adopted for attaining a higher level of satisfaction for human aspirations and demonstrating collaboration with the other members of the community to promote the common good to ensure that it is contributed freely productively and in a manner that makes everyones collaboration viable the members shall respect its discipline namely a hierarchy
4312717 when humans are confronted with conflict their mind brains shift to a very primitive and highly reactive way of thinking called the
4312718 system of human organization that creates a conflict free environment for decision making and action implementation
4312719 this is a law of life and the more lavishingly we show kindness and concern the richer is our life in what manner we get back what we have given is of minor importance the only thing that life promises is that life pays back all its debts to us
4312720 for us to stand together united until this battle is won the people of berlin have spoken we have done our duty and we will keep on doing our duty people of the world now do your duty people of the world look at berlin
4312721 we must all hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately
4312722 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4312723 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
4312724 there are severe criminal penalties for collusion and on that basis we strongly suggest that any suggestion of collusion in the petrol market be supported by factual evidence rather than throwing around baseless accusations
4312725 the nigerian states of nassarawa and kwara have persuaded white farmers from zim to farm in their states loans and about 45 000 acres have been allocated to each farmer persuaded to head north
4312726 sorting of rubbish can be done very well by large machines at centralised factories or even outsourced to foreign lands but the green movement insist we do it at home as a penance for our consumerism almost as if when we needed pins we were forced to make them at home it is this forbidding of the division of labour that makes us poorer and is symptomatic of the green movement

4312730 some of my classmates push me outside the door before their religion class others ask me why am i not orthodox the same way the priest had asked my parents
4312731 god helps me forgive them but i dont like these jokes
4312732 religious education here indoctrinates fuelling prejudice against other faiths and against sexual minorities
4312733 but its more than this teaching children to discriminate against something builds a national mentality and in the end people reject differences and discriminate against everything
4312734 credibly asserted that authorities pressured children of other faiths to attend classes of orthodox religion
4312735 religious and sexual discrimination are not a problem of the schools as far as i know all religions say their god is the greatest and almost all disagree with homosexuality and we cant change peoples faiths
4312736 the values offered by religious education are needed desperately in times of aggressive and materialist individualism
4312737 cults seeking to introduce christ to the romanian people as if they havent known him for almost two millennia
4312738 it is very important that mid has constructive communications with shareholders and i believe that dennis is an excellent communicator who will be able to facilitate a productive dialogue dennis also has a long standing association with mid magna and mec i believe that these traits will serve him well and that he will make a very positive contribution as mid continues to evaluate its investment in mec and works to reestablish its relationship with magna

4312750 the balance sheet for year end 1866 is tantalising in what it leaves unsaid and without further figures it is only part of the picture this statement falls short of the standards of reporting required today and its odd assortment of balances have the slender merit of providing cosmetic comfort to the casual observer

4312760 a break that contained darren and ian formed as the race approached the last climb which was exactly as we had hoped for in our game plan going into the stage
4312761 ian did a fantastic job for me today since we were in the break of 15 but no one really wanted to pull so ian was doing the lions share of the work
4312762 ian had a great ride but unfortunately he flatted out of the break
4312763 we were able to change his wheel very quickly so he latched onto the chase group without any trouble but that left darren alone to work in the breakaway
4312764 when ian flatted out we still had only about 40 seconds on the chase group so i decided to ride as hard as i could especially since none of the other riders were going to help me
4312765 darren attacked on the climb and went clear with garmins blake caldwell
4312766 darren was very strong but since blakes team mate and race leader jason donald was in the chase group he didnt have to work with darren on the climb
4312767 blake was able to come around darren at the end
4312768 they managed to put 18 seconds into the next chase group and we should see darren probably in third place overall tonight
4312769 there is one more mountain stage which will definitely shake up the classification a little more and darren is probably one of the best climbers who can time trial at this race so we are feeling fairly good about the situation tonight
4312770 we are also pretty pleased that the task of defending the jersey hasnt fallen to us too soon especially since we are now down two riders
4312771 scott touched wheels with someone mid race and went down hard we suspect he may have fractured his collarbone though im not certain about that
4312772 it was just one of those innocuous small accidents that happen sometimes and have a larger impact than we would like
4312773 sometimes these breaks can be very minor so we could see scott back in action pretty soon
4312774 our calendar is packed solid and the guys are racing hard wherever we send them
4312775 we were tackling tour de france cat ones in the pyrenees against some tough european racing competition while the guys here in the us were taking care of business in some of the fastest races of the year that really helps us build positive momentum going into downers grove in a few days
4312776 we knew this was going to be tough going in with a four man team
4312777 all of our guys rode exceptionally well with lacombe and veilleux showing incredible fitness and drive add this to the kind of form our squad demonstrated in france and we are in great shape to go into the uspro criterium road race and time trial championships

4312806 sen obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle class wage earners
4312807 thats why his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000 not income taxes capital gains taxes dividend or payroll taxes
4312808 the reality of barack obamas record is the following he has voted to raise taxes 94 times in his short time as a senator
4312809 barack obama can say it but it doesnt make it true
4312810 the opinion piece that we saw today in the wall street journal is part of a path that obamas taking which takes him back more towards the middle more towards mccains policies
4312811 were pleased to see that because there is tremendous uncertainty over obamas plans for the economy and for the stock market and for the markets overall
4312812 it was like the old days when we would draw crowds of upwards of 20 000 on weekends

4312823 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4312824 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4312825 being so far away from things its hard to grasp we got a call in the hotel at 6 20 a m this morning usually when you get a call that early its not good but he assured us right at the start that it was good news he was about to tell us i played today but honestly cant remember a single shot i hit i was thinking about him all day hell be well advised for sure i just hope he takes it
4312826 there is no divide to the air that we all breathe or the clean water that we all depend on
4312827 there is no divide between our common desire to make the border region an economic powerhouse

4312874 waarschijnlijk leefde ik te ontspannen naar dat wk toe ik was iets te gemakkelijk nu is de felheid weer terug
4312875 deze winter dacht ik vooruitgang te boeken door iets zwaarder te gaan rijden omdat ik met mijn leeftijd meer kracht op de pedalen moet kunnen overbrengen het was zeker geen verkeerde keuze maar de oude kleinere versnelling voelt weer goed
4312876 met de dag begin ik hier sneller te rijden ik heb een kleine week last gehad van een jetlag en ook aan de baan moest ik weer even wennen met de teamsprint staan we er goed voor de wetenschap dat ik een sprinter ben die in een toernooi groeit sterkt me de individuele sprint is over drie dagen verspreid dat is zeker in mijn voordeel

4312888 michael moore has endorsed you but he recently said fill in the blank with some outrageously offensive line taken out of context will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
4312889 i had been with john for about three years he was a really nice guy and i enjoyed being with him but there wasnt a ton of passion most everyone we knew had gotten engaged and though john would have proposed in a second whenever he brought it up id change the subject i took a trip to australia for work and while i was gone i got together with a co worker to whom id always been insanely attracted i had a fantastic trip probably because for the first time in a long time i experienced that excitement id been missing i broke up with john soon after i returned home and began dating the guy from the trip even though im not super proud of my actions things ended up for the best after dating for a few years the guy from the trip and i got married and were incredibly happy together
4312890 right before i was going to break up with my ex sean he found out that he had to put his beloved dog to sleep he was so broken up about it that i didnt have the heart to end things so i waited a month or so until he was in better shape when things seemed to be better and i was ready he lost his job so i felt like i was back to square one by that time i had met someone else that i really wanted to start seeing so i went ahead and did it i eventually ended things never telling sean about my extra curricular dating i think i rationalized that i was trying to spare his feelings
4312891 my boyfriend greg and i decided to do the long distance thing after i was accepted to a graduate program 200 miles from where we lived the first few months were fine but i soon found myself becoming extremely attracted to my lab partner henry what began as innocent flirting eventually wound up with us in bed after the program was over i returned home to greg being with him was really difficult but i didnt break up with him initially because i was still attracted to him too i visited henry a few times and realized that he was really more of a fling probably born out of boredom and that greg was the one for me i eventually stopped communicating with henry i never told greg about what happened which occasionally makes me feel guilty but i chalk my cheating up to being young and silly he and i are still together four years since my program ended
4312892 i began dating eric shortly after i had been dumped by dave my boyfriend of two years i was devastated and eric was definitely a rebound thing after eric and i had dated for five months dave came back and wanted to give things another shot i still really missed him so i began seeing him but never ended things with eric i think i sort of kept eric around for insurance purposes just in case things didnt end up well with dave dave and i didnt make it on round two and after eric discovered through mutual friends that i had been seeing him again he ended things with me i definitely learned my lesson about dating two guys at the same time not to mention trying to rekindle a relationship thats just plain over
4312893 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
4312894 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
4312895 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him

4312950 i dont like setting targets i think really the major target is going to be staying in the premier league
4312951 obviously wed like to improve considerably from what we did last year but i dont want to quantify that by saying this place or that place
4312952 ill see how the season pans out and see how good we can be and then maybe start setting definite targets during the course of the season
4312953 weve signed players and we are happy with the signings we think that it has made us stronger as a unit
4312954 its a new team it might take a bit of time for certain positions to bed in but i have been very happy with the way people have been working in the pre season i have been very happy with the pre season results
4312955 he had a thigh strain when he arrived from everton and we dont want to take the risk by playing him too early im pretty sure he will be able to play against arsenal on aug 23 but well have to do without him at hull
4312956 i think with the quality we have got we are capable of pushing for mid table i think it would be realistically a good achievement for us
4312957 were never satisfied and it needs to get better but the focus was good
4312958 we were pretty sharp defensively and not real sharp offensively in the red zone
4312959 weve got to take better care of the ball and make sure were not having negative plays its hard to tell when its not live and youre actually gaining plays and that type stuff there are so many things we cant do that we would do in the red zone and it wasnt a bad day but weve got to be sharper

4312961 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4312962 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4312963 ive got to convince the player this is the place for him to come and play his football
4312964 justin hoyte has got fantastic potential hes already a very good player and weve done research we know hes a good professional in terms of his lifestyle

4312966 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4312967 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4312968 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves

4312973 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together

4312975 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4312976 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4312977 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4312978 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4312979 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4312980 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4312981 i must tell you gentlemen i only put 20 000 on top of mr johnson i wanted buy this new machine that would enable me to diagnose his rare disease and save others its what he would have wanted
4312982 i have to confess i only put 10 000 on top of mr johnson we needed that money to help more homeless and its what mr johnson wouldve wanted
4312983 i cant believe both of you stealing from a dead man i wrote mr johnson a check for the full 30 000

4312986 no one had enough brains and guts to risk humiliation to raise a hand and say chief were not ready here lets stop everything as a result mobileme badly crashed on launch
4312987 the new ka is the perfect match for the character of camille adventurous individual and thoroughly modern
4312988 we are delighted that the launch of the film coincides with the launch of such a significant new model for ford of europe

4312994 were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna
4312995 i think i am going to hopefully just be putting up more of a fight in the last few laps this time whereas i ran off and crashed at the last race
4312996 it would be nice if i can put pressure on right up until the last lap
4312997 its not a job that i would be considered for and i honestly dont think im suited to do that
4312998 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4312999 we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights
4313000 i think that choice and gay rights are fundamental issues left to individuals
4313001 i never thought the government should be involved in even discussing them they are personal things and if you really believe in the constitution of this country if you really are particularly i think if you are a conservative you should say government should get out of the bedroom

4313018 manakala hadir dalam keadaan sehat dan istiqomah konsisten di atas rute perjalanan menuju allah azza wa jalla tergantung pada kumpulnya unsur pendukung hati tersebut kepada allah dan menyalurkannya dengan menghadapkan hati tersebut kepada allah azza wa jalla secara menyeluruh karena kusutnya hati tidak akan sembuh kecuali dengan menghadapkan nya kepada allah azza wa jalla sedangkan makan dan minum dengan berlebih lebihan dan berlebih lebihan dalam bergaul terlalu banyak bicara dan tidur termasuk dari unsur unsur yang menjadikan hati bertambah berantakan kusut dan mencerai beraikan hati di setiap tempat dan hal hal tersebut akan memutuskan perjalanan hati menuju allah atau akan melemahkannya menghalangi dan menghentikannya rahmat allah yang maha perkasa lagi penyayang menghendaki untuk mensyariatkan bagi mereka puasa yang menyebabkan hilangnya kelebihan makan dan minum pada hambanya dan akan membersihkan kecenderungan syahwat pada hati yang mana syahwat tersebut dapat merintangi perjalanan hati menuju allah azza wa jalla dan disyariatkannya itikaf berdasarkan maslahah kebaikan yang akan diperoleh hingga seorang hamba dapat mengambil manfaat dari amalan tersebut baik di dunia maupun di akhirat kelak dan disyariatkannya itikaf bagi mereka yang mana maksudnya serta ruhnya adalah berdiamnya hati kepada allah azza wa jalla dan kumpulnya hati kepada allah berkhalwat dengan nya dan memutuskan segala kesibukan dengan makhluk hanya menyibukkan diri kepada allah semata hingga jadilah meng ingat nya kecintaan dan penghadapan kepadanya sebagai ganti kesedihan duka hati dan betikan betikannya sehingga ia mampu mencurahkan kepada nya dan jadilah keinginan semua kepada nya dan semua betikan betikan hati dengan mengingat nya bertafakur dalam mendapatkan keridhaan dengan sesuatu yang mendekatkan dirinya kepada allah sehingga bermesraan dengan berkhalwat dengan allah sebagai ganti kelembutannya terhadap makhluk yang menyebabkan dia berbuat demikian adalah karena kelembutannya tersebut kepada allah pada hari kesedihan di dalam kubur mankala sudah tidak ada lagi yang berbuat lembut kepadanya dan manakala tidak ada lagi yang membahagiakan dirinya selain daripada nya maka inilah maksud dari itikaf yang agung itu
4313019 wahai rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam sesungguhnya aku ini pernah nadzar pada jaman jahiliyyah dahulu yaitu aku akan beritikaf pada malam hari di masjidil haram
4313020 dan sesungguhnya rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam pernah memasukkan kepalanya kepadaku padahal beliau sedang itikaf di masjid
4313021 nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam berwudlu di dalam masjid dengan wudlu yang ringan
4313022 dahulu nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam tatkala beliau sedang itikaf pada sepuluh hari terakhir di bulan ramadhan aku datang mengunjunginya pada malam hari ketika itu di sisinya ada beberapa isteri beliau sedang bergembira ria maka akupun berbincang sejenak kemudian aku bangun untuk kembali maka beliaupun berkata jangan engkau tergesa gesa sampai aku bisa mengantarmu kemudian beliau berdiri bersamaku untuk mengantarkan aku pulang tempat tinggal shafiyyah yaitu rumah usamah bin zaid sesampainya di samping pintu masjid yang terletak di samping pintu ummu salamah lewatlah dua orang laki laki laki laki dari kalangan anshar dan ketika keduanya melihat nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam maka keduanyapun bergegas kemudian nabi pun bersabda
4313023 sesungguhnya syetan itu menjalar menggoda anak adam pada aliran darahnya dan sesungguhnya aku khawatir akan bersarangnya kejelekan di hati kalian atau beliau berkata sesuatu
4313024 nabi shalallahu alaihi wassalam itikaf pada sepuluh hari terakhir pada bulan ramadhan sampai al mewafatkan beliau kemudian isteri isteri beliau itikaf setelah itu
4313025 pada atsar tersebut ada suatu dalil yang menunjukkan atas bolehnya wanita itikaf dan tidak diragukan lagi bahwa hal itu dibatasi dengan catatan adanya izin dari wali wali mereka dan aman dari fitnah berdasarkan dalil dali yang banyak mengenai larangan berkhalwat dan kaidah fiqhiyah
4313026 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4313027 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4313028 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam memerintahkan kami dengan shadaqah fithri sebelum diturunkannya kewajiban zakat dan tatkala diturunkannya kewajiban zakat beliau tidak memerintahkan kami dan tidak pula melarang kami tetapi kami mengerjakan mengeluarkan zakat fithri
4313029 bahwa pada sanadnya ada rawi yang tidak dikenal196 akan tetapi hadits tersebut mempunyai penguat dan dikeluarkan oleh an nasai 5 49 dan ibnu majah 1 585 dan ahmad 6 6 ibnu khuzaimah 4 81 dan al hakim 1 410 dan al baihaqi 4 159 dari beberapa jalan dan sanadnya shahih dan kalaupun dianggap shahih tidak ada dalil yang menunjukkan atas naskh diahapusnya hadits qais yang menunjukkan wajibnya zakat fithri mungkin rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mencukupkan dengan perintah yang pertama karena turunnya suatu kewajiban tidaklah menggugurkan kewajiban yang lain
4313030 ini tidak menunjukkan hilangnya kewajiban zakat fithri tetapi hanya menunjukkan tambahan dalam jenis ibadah tidak mengharuskan dimansukhknya hukum sebelumnya kedudukan zakat harta sebagaiman kedudukan zakat fithri yaitu berkaitan dengan riqab orang per orang
4313031 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mewajibkan zakat fithri sebanyak satu gantang kurma atau satu gantang gandum atas hamba dan orang yang merdeka kecil dan besar dari kalangan kaum muslimin
4313032 tidak wajib atas orang yang puasa karena hadits ibnu abbas radhiallahu anhuma
4313033 zakat fithri wajib atas orang yang puasa yang kaya atau orang fakir yang mendapatkan makanan dari dia jika illat diwajibkannya karena pensucian maka seluruh orang yang puasa butuh akan hal itu jika berserikat dalam illat berserikat pula dalam hukum
4313034 pensucian disebutkan untuk menghukumi yang dominan zakat fithri diwajibkan pula atas orang yang tidak berpuasa seperti diketahui keshahihannya atau orang yang masuk islam sesaat sebelum terbenamnya matahari
4313035 kami mengeluarkan zakat pada zaman rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam satu gantang makanan satu gantang gandum satu gantang korma satu gantang susu kering satu gantang anggur kering
4313036 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mewajibkan atu gantang gandum satu gantang korma dan satu gantang salt
4313037 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam menyuruh kami untuk mengeluarkan zakat ramadhan satu gantang makanan dari anak kecil besar budak dan orang yang merdeka
4313038 barangsiapa yang mengeluarkan berupa tepung akan diterima barangsiapa yang mengeluarkan berupa adonan diterima
4313039 zakat fithri satu gantang makanan barangsiapa yang membawa gandum diterima yang membawa korma diterima yang membawa salt gandum yang tidak berkulit diterima yang membawa anggur kering diterima aku mengira beliau berkata
4313040 dulu makanan kami adalah gandum anggur kering susu yang dikeringkan dan korma
4313041 tunaikanlah satu gantang gandum atau korma untuk dua orang satu gantang dari gandum atas orang merdeka hamba anak kecil atau besar
4313042 timbangan yang teranggap adalah timbangannya ahlu mekah dan kiloan yang teranggap adalah kiloan nya orang madinah
4313043 kami diperintah oleh rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mengeluarkan shadaqah fithri atas anak kecil dan orang tua orang merdeka dan hamba dari orang orang yang membekalinya
4313044 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam zakat fithri sebagai pembersih diri bagi yang berpuasa dari perbuatan sia sia dan perbuatan kotor dan sebagai makanan bagi orang orang miskin
4313045 barangsiapa yang menunaikan zakatnya sebelum shalat maka dia adalah zakat yang diterima dan barangsiapa yang menunaikannya setelah shalat maka dia adalah merupakan shadaqah dari beberapa shadaqah yang ada
4313046 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4313047 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak
4313048 kalaulah seandainya kaum muslimin tahu apa yang ada di dalam ramadhan niscaya umatku akan berangan angan agar satu tahun ramadhan seluruhnya
4313049 jika haditsnya shahih karena dalam hatiku ada keraguan pada jarir bin ayyub al bajali
4313050 wahai manusia sungguh bulan yang agung twlah menaungi kalian bulan yang didalamnya terdapat suatu malam yang lebih baik dari seribu bulan allah menjadikan puasa pada bulan itu sebagai satu kewajiban dan menjadikan shalat malamnya sebagai amalan sunnah
4313051 sumbernya pada ali bin zaid bin jadan dan dia lemah
4313052 aku mendengar imam ahmad dan beliau menyebutkan riwayat orang orang syam dari zuhair bin muhammad berkata
4313053 hafalannya jelek dan hadits dia dari syam lebih mungkar daripada haditsnya yang berasal dari irak karena jeleknya hafalan dia
4313054 hadits hadits yang mereka riwayatkan dari ahli syam ini tidak membuatku kagum
4313055 barangsiapa yang berbuka puasa satu hari pada bulan ramadhan tanpa ada sebab dan tidak pula karena sakit maka puasa satu tahun pun tidak akan dapat mencukupinya walaupun ia berpuasa pada satu tahun tersebut
4313056 dalam hadits ini ada perselisihan tentang hubaib bin abi tsabit dengan perselisihan yang banyak hingga kesimpulannya ada tiga penyakit idhthirab goncang tidak diketahuinya keadaan abil muthawwas dan diragukan pendengaran bapak beliau dari abu hurairah
4313057 jika khabarnya shahih karena aku tidak mengenal abil muthawwas dan tidak pula bapaknya sehingga hadits ini dhaif juga
4313058 sesungguhnya yang takut kepada allah di antara hamba hamba nya hanyalah ulama sesungguhnya allah maha perkasa lagi maha pengampun
4313059 sesungguhnya ulama adalah pewaris para nabi sungguh para nabi tidak mewariskan dinar dan dirham sungguh mereka hanya mewariskan ilmu maka barangsiapa mengambil warisan tersebut ia telah mengambil bagian yang banyak

4313072 people in underserved communities are sometimes not aware of the health care services that are available to them

4313080 i will do it as an experiment and record my findings via my weekly posting at mari smith teresa thanks a million for the opportunity to contribute to you and your readers
4313081 because the story answers to most of the myths and preconceptions westerners already have about soviet life the problem will be to make sure that students read it with the same degree of resistance with which they would normally confront any other piece of fiction
4313082 discuss the meaning of ritual suicide among the yoruba as it is explained in soyinkas play
4313083 without any censorship in the west fashionable trends of thought and ideas are carefully separated from those which are not fashionable nothing is forbidden but what is not fashionable will hardly ever find its way into periodicals or books or be heard in colleges
4313084 many people living in the west are dissatisfied with their own society they despise it or accuse it of not being up to the level of maturity attained by mankind a number of such critics turn to socialism
4313085 as humanism in its development became more and more materialistic it made itself increasingly accessible to speculation and manipulation at first by socialism and then by communism
4313086 you have a suspicious substance that was found in a hotel room in conjunction with person being a foreign national and we have a lot of questions and that is why we are assisting
4313087 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4313088 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4313089 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4313090 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4313091 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4313092 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4313093 the environment is my thing so i immediately started trying to look for ways to approach it from a sustainability standpoint
4313094 building dashboard is a web based application that reports real time utility usage statistics to building occupants

4313096 harvard hooked up its buses with gps so you can see exactly where they are in real time
4313097 if someone was waiting at the bus stop they could access the site with their phone or blackberry and figure out exactly how far away their bus is theres lots of room for innovation
4313098 students actually take into consideration how green a campus is i think if we put the information right in front of them everything will make much more sense as far as how energy is used

4313107 this scale is 10 times larger than what was being talked about awhile ago
4313108 this makes large scale solar an increasingly likely and large part of the energy portfolio in california and the west
4313109 we will continue to explore such innovative technologies as we aggressively work to increase the amount of renewable energy we provide our customers
4313110 if they can get the costs down to the range theyre talking about that would be a real major step
4313111 but we dont know exactly what the numbers are because theyre not being made public im wondering why there isnt more transparency in this

4313115 thus no consent was sought nor was any consent obtained from persons who utilize the facebook beacon activated affiliates web site who were not facebook members
4313116 even with respect to facebook users the beacon program did not obtain any consent prior to the communication of identifying transactional information to facebook
4313117 i think facebook is still trying to make beacon work and the roots of what they are doing make sense
4313118 but if people keep thinking that their privacy is being violated facebook has to listen to its users because without users there will be no facebook
4313119 its a digital breath of fresh air and facebook needs to be held accountable
4313120 the lawsuit and public outrage over beacon forced facebook to backpedal on its plans but the fact of the matter is that facebook is a black data collection box

4313143 our investigation revealed that ubs had knowledge that a market collapse was looming but did not disclose that information to the new hampshire higher education loan corp
4313144 we will vigorously defend ourselves against this complaint as we believe that we worked in the best interests of our investor and issuer clients this complaint attempts to link a single client interaction with overall market conditions which affected all student loan issuers and as such we believe there is no basis for these specific allegations
4313145 their goal should be to figure out how to get student loans out
4313146 given that we have been in discussions with them and the new hampshire corporation regarding the unique issues being raised by the state
4313147 has no impact on that settlement and ubs clients in new hampshire will be made whole under the settlement proposal

4313187 theres a reason why we tell mothers to remain calm during pregnancy the foetus can hear and feel whatever the parent is doing and can be a reason for future family conflicts very often we have teenagers who have been told by their relatives that their mothers didnt want them at the time of pregnancy and this can give rise to serious issues

4313217 after two hours they were advised that there was really no point continuing with their efforts
4313218 she made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary in the snow partially on a skidoo
4313219 it takes her clark about 24 hours to tune out of her special work environment and then shes like everybody else
4313220 up to 1 in 50 troops seriously injured by vaccines
4313221 97 plus percent of children dont have these kinds of defects and so when you look at what the vaccine risk is to children and then what the benefits are the benefits far outweigh the risks that occur
4313222 the sound will be bad but we dont cancel because we love you so much

4313224 novamente depois que levamos a virada nosso time se perdeu em campo e acabou tomando o terceiro gol que dificultou muito a nossa chance na competi o
4313225 o time at se posicionou bem principalmente no primeiro tempo mas ap s o segundo gol nos perdemos em campo e nos complicamos claro que temos chance de reverter mas temos de saber que o 2 a 1 para a gente era interessante pois um gol nos dava a classifica o
4313226 isso n o pode acontecer a gente estava perdendo de 2 a 1 t nhamos feito um gol aqui a gente ia para belo horizonte precisando fazer um gol apenas e estar amos classificados mas com este gol que a gente tomou no final vamos ter que fazer dois
4313227 a gente fez um bom jogo acabamos levando o segundo gol ali em uma desaten o nossa coisa que vem acontecendo a tempo e a gente vem conversando para estar corrigindo isso mas infelizmente isso aconteceu de novo
4313228 a gente estava com o jogo nas m os infelizmente sofremos o empate no segundo tempo a equipe se manteve postada at determinado ponto sofremos dois gols que n o estariam nos nossos planos mas infelizmente aconteceu
4313229 eu disse que ia pegar esse recorde de novo agora preciso ver se esse franc s n o vai nadar mais r pido
4313230 muito bom saber que j estou na final foi um tempo bom e espero baixar ainda mais para amanh
4313231 come amos agora o nosso trabalho estou muito focado e descansei bem nessa semana para fazer uma boa prova sabia que poderia ficar entre os tr s soltei um pouco n o precisava me esfor ar tanto logo no come o

4313253 the family are really pleased to be back in america
4313254 our history of success in the states is well known and weve a lot of friends over here in the wine trade whove made us feel most welcome
4313255 sales of our wines within australia have more than met our expectations
4313256 and now the next stage is to make our mark in the states
4313257 some people may question our timing what with the value of the dollar and the slowdown of australian wine exports to the us however its precisely these distractions that can provide us with opportunities we seek
4313258 the first orders against our initial shipment of 300 000 bottles have been most heartening and weve the support of an outstanding team of distributors
4313259 i should definitely make the team better theres no ifs ands or buts about it i already know what kind of coach rick adelman is and i definitely should be able to help out
4313260 when you get a chance to play for same organization that had and clyde drexler youve got to appreciate that
4313261 from hearing rons recent statements its obvious that he has an immense desire to win
4313262 we have a team of players who have that same immense desire and ron will fit right in
4313263 i didnt think about the streak until i started walking back on the mound
4313264 the first thought that popped in my head was i cant believe that just happened with a runner on first but i guess the good thing it wasnt a cheap one a whole bunch of things fell at once and so that way theres no pressure from this point on
4313265 its almost been like a no hitter type streak or something
4313266 unbelievable what hes done but ill get him right back out and try to start another one hes been tremendous
4313267 there were many many moments where momentum shifted and we were able to stay focused stay poised and come out of some tough situations
4313268 eventually we were able to put some runs on the board but the key was being able to stay in the present and not letting that shift of momentum affect our approach at the plate and on the mound its a great win for us because it was quite difficult
4313269 this type of win is whats been happening since early in the season when we started win a lot of games late
4313270 weve got our confidence up and we believe as long as we go on that field weve got a chance to win
4313271 its exactly what were looking for beyond everything else is the continuous maximum effort it was tremendous i loved it
4313272 the solidarity of nato from the baltic to the black sea
4313273 and declared in a section of the speech dealing with the black sea region where georgia is located that the u
4313274 rather than tolerate russias nuclear blackmail or cyber attacks western nations should make clear that the solidarity of nato from the baltic to the black sea is indivisible
4313275 your teeth look great your husband did a good job marrying you b c your children will be lucky if they get your teeth
4313276 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4313277 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4313278 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4313279 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4313280 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4313281 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4313282 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4313283 why not make my new school backpack more unique than it already is
4313284 it was through his cheek and then it went through his shoulder and went out the other side of his back
4313285 they said it was close to his spine but it was just above it

4313288 which food item would you like to give the houseguests for the week giant lollipops coconuts or bologna that keep that in mind comments
4313289 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4313290 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4313291 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4313292 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4313293 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays
4313294 routinely given to advance science and treatments for the benefit of patients
4313295 a lot of the experts are turned to by industry for consulting
4313296 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4313297 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
4313298 looking through a different lens dynamic assessment and the multicontext treatment approach
4313299 if i may be so bold there was another president
4313300 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4313301 i represent umno stop this forum dont insult islam you chinese indians go to hell
4313302 good to know but now lets talk with our other interviewers

4313304 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
4313305 martha jones ex time traveler and now working as a doctor for a u n task force has been called to cern the worlds largest particle physics laboratory in geneva where theyre about to activate the large hadron collider lhc
4313306 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france
4313307 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
4313308 i am very disappointed at what has happened but i would do the same again
4313309 its unthinkable why someone would take someones car when they are just trying to help a man who has been seriously hurt
4313310 this womans compassion has been totally taken advantage of by a pathetic opportunistic thief
4313311 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
4313312 give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
4313313 dont get scared but you blacked out for a few seconds
4313314 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4313315 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4313316 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4313317 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4313318 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4313319 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4313320 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4313321 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4313322 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts
4313323 its not the marijuana thats dangerous for me its the chocolate to which i could easily become addicted again
4313324 he is still on leave and we never issued a statement that his services would be terminated his services are still needed by the hospital
4313325 i do not want to comment on that how long he will be on leave or when he is due back
4313326 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4313327 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4313328 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4313329 he went the whole practice yesterday and played pretty good
4313330 he made some plays he came in this morning and said his shoulder came out and he had trouble raising it
4313331 the other guys have to step up but we cant afford to lose any more
4313332 mack frost has to stay healthy and jeremy navarre has to stay healthy armstrong have to play good
4313333 i make this look good you wasnt rockin it right
4313334 you never really cherish something until you lose that something
4313335 the day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect he becomes an adolescent the day he forgives them he becomes an adult the day the child forgives himself he becomes wise
4313336 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone it does what they need it to do and basically that is just to make a phone call
4313337 theyre still going to remain in the minority mainly because these devices basically just arent for everyone
4313338 voice and text are certainly very popular because you know what theyre forms of communication and thats what people want to do
4313339 i never looked at the consequences of missing a big shot when you think about the consequences you always think of a negative result

4313370 in the number ix jordans wit tha deuce trey on back
4313371 by varying the lattice constant and the number of periods in the photonic crystal structure peacock feathers provide several 2d photonic crystal structures with different colors
4313372 in our recent nanotechnology research we embedded light emitting nanoparticles into natural photonic crystals in order to fabricate novel biomaterial based optical devices with tunable spontaneous emission
4313373 in the resulting nanozno peacock feather the feather not only functions as the support for zno nanoparticles but also should serve as the light controller according to its 2d photonic crystal structure which is still under investigation
4313374 embedment of zno nanoparticles in the natural photonic crystals within peacock feathers
4313375 we assumed that in an ideal system the spontaneous emission is tuned both by the embedded nanostructures and by the photonic crystal matrix of the peacock feather which is famous for its ability to control light in the visible range
4313376 we chose zno nanoparticles as the light emitting entity with defect emission that spans the visible spectrum meanwhile the ordered melanin arrays within peacock feathers are chosen as the natural photonic crystals that have the ability of controlling visible light in the resulting nanozno peacock feather the feather not only functions as the support for zno nanoparticles but also should serve as the light controller according to its 2d photonic crystal structure
4313377 these biomatters mainly serve as the reactive chemical template the surface modifier as well as the bottom up assembly director to control the formation and assembly of nanoparticles and nanoclusters in solution
4313378 however further treatment like spin casting and langmuir blodgett deposition technique is needed to obtain solid state products for extensive applications in our research we introduce a facile route to in situ fabricate zno nanoparticles in solid state biosubstrate
4313379 the specific hierarchical porous structures have been observed to influence the gas sensing and photocatalysis properties of biomorphic nanomaterials
4313380 we also investigated silk fibroin fibers with strings like morphology bacteria with sphere and rod shapes as well as butterfly wings peacock feathers and diatom frustules with ordered photonic crystal structures to integrate and enhance the functionalities of inorganic nanoparticles the resulting hybrid nanocomposites exhibit outstanding chemical or physical properties and have valuable applications in photocatalysis gas sensing ductile ceramics and semiconductor technology
4313381 fabrication and gas sensitivity of sno2 hierarchical films with interwoven tubular conformation by a biotemplate directed sol gel technique
4313382 biogenic synthesis and photocatalysis of pd pdo nanoclusters reinforced hierarchical tio2 films with interwoven and tubular conformations
4313383 novel bacteria templated sonochemical route for the in situ one step synthesis of zns hollow nanostructures
4313384 in situ synthesis and photoluminescence of qd cds on silk fibroin fibers at room temperature
4313385 we envisage that the exploration of these areas will provide new possibilities for the rational design of various kinds of functional nanomaterials with ideal hierarchy and controllable length scales
4313386 bio inspired strategies integrating biotemplate biomineralization and biomimesis will be extensively developed in the next few years to obtain functional nanocomposites with hierarchical architectures and interrelated unique properties
4313387 i never looked at the consequences of missing a big shot when you think about the consequences you always think of a negative result
4313388 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4313389 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
4313390 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth
4313391 the reasons that women most frequently cite for terminating a pregnancy include not being ready to care for a child or another child at that time financial inability to care for a child concern for or responsibility to others desire to avoid single parenthood relationship problems and feeling too young or immature to raise a child
4313392 some pregnancies are terminated because they are a consequence of rape or incest very few fewer than 1 percent women cite coercion from others as a major reason for their abortion
4313393 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4313394 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4313395 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4313396 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4313397 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time
4313398 the worst day in santa monica is better the best day wherever else you might be
4313399 who would choose a kid in a wheelchair to save their world
4313400 but from age three we knew something was wrong she was very introverted isolated when she started school at four she came home and said she was a freak it seemed a strange word for a four year old to use she was always quite a sad little person
4313401 looking back we could never find any tape in the house it was because she was taping her genitals up every day she said to us later that she thought it would all go right for her at puberty that her willy would drop off and she would grow breasts she said she was going completely crazy because she knew in her head that she was a girl
4313402 she was there in front of the mirror with her genitals tucked away
4313403 i had watched programmes on transgender im very interested in people its part of who i am to find out about these things but you never imagine its going to happen to you
4313404 it was apparent he was unhappy and said he wanted to be a girl
4313405 thousands of families face raising children who step outside the pink or blue box
4313406 well say things like youre special god made you special because there arent very many little girls out there that have a penis
4313407 it usually becomes more evident when they go to school
4313408 there have been reported cases of kids who wont drink for the duration of the school day so that they dont have to go to the toilet and who dont want to sleep in a bedroom with their peers
4313409 we get 60 to 80 referrals a year and our referrals are going up we see children from as young as six up to aged 18
4313410 we get a lot of calls from parents who have five to nine year olds there seem to be more boys than girls affected at that age
4313411 which is probably because its more acceptable for girls to be tomboys if you have a little girl who wants to cut her hair short or play football that is seen as normal but if you have a boy who wants to draw mermaids or dress up as a princess they get made fun of
4313412 for others it is likely to go on for some years and will cause a lot of problems
4313413 as far as theyre concerned a trans outcome is bad they are hoping that during puberty the natural hormones themselves will act on the brain to cure these trans teenagers what we do know is what happens if you dont offer hormone blockers you are stuck with unwanted secondary sex characteristics in the long term and in the short term these teenagers end up suicidal
4313414 the only indication i did have when she was a child was that she showed an interest in female clothing not wearing it but just having some in her room i said you mustnt take your sisters clothes and then forgot about it i was completely amazed shocked and frightened when i did find out some years later what was happening but i have always felt that people have a right to be who they are i felt that whoever this person was i was her parent and i wanted to support her
4313415 we have run 11 family workshops and seen over 200 individuals in family situations i like to think that we have helped an enormous number of people to get over that first shock of rejection and sadly sometimes revulsion
4313416 when you live with it it is so obvious and so extreme some of these children are saying from a very early age this is what i am why doesnt anyone understand that my name is bob and i am not a girl sometimes its as soon as they can talk at age two or three
4313417 the uk stance on puberty suppressing drugs is completely unreasonable in other countries they are provided as soon as puberty has commenced but obtaining this treatment which suppresses oestrogen in girls and testosterone in boys is very difficult in this country
4313418 it is a temporary reversible intervention if the child changes their mind they can be interrupted they are entirely benign with no known side effects
4313419 but there are cases that are very clear where the disorder is strong and persistent
4313420 the dutch data looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up the data is not over a long enough period of time and that concerns endocrinologists
4313421 the question is if you halt your own sex hormones so that your brain is not experiencing puberty are you in some way altering the course of nature
4313422 there is a small amount of evidence for differences in the brain
4313423 that is a very interesting finding but it is not robust enough to say that it is definitely the only reason and that it is an innate condition it is most likely multifactorial
4313424 feelings are very intense and it is very difficult for families and young people to cope with the uncertainty they are very strong in their conviction that they are in the wrong body
4313425 at her school they were shocked but they were wonderful
4313426 it was explained to all the year groups that it was a condition and not a choice they explained the effect it had on her and that bullying would not be tolerated the kids were great it was the parents saying they didnt want a freak in school with their child
4313427 it takes a long long time to come to terms with it took us about two years to stop crying for our loss and also for the pain that we knew our child was going to have to go through no one would choose this its too hard ive asked my daughter if this condition was known about in 1989 when i was pregnant and there was an option to have a termination would you have wanted me to she said yes and i agree if i had known what it would be like for her i would have done it thats how bad it is

4313429 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
4313430 adolescents are faced with so many influences that contribute to smoking attitudes and behaviors to find that a simple household rule that bans smoking in the home has a meaningful impact on smoking attitudes and behaviors is somewhat surprising
4313431 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
4313432 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not okay to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent
4313433 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
4313434 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months
4313435 there are no such things as liberators the people liberate themselves
4313436 i never looked at the consequences of missing a big shot when you think about the consequences you always think of a negative result

4313445 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4313446 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4313447 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4313448 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4313481 were pretty confident in winning our share of that and growing our existing customer base

4313571 the possibility of widespread social distress and even political instability
4313572 dismal economic conditions also foster forces of discontent that potentially could turn against the kim regime especially if knowledge of the luxurious lifestyle of communist party leaders becomes better known or as poor economic performance hurts even the elite
4313573 the only significant power base that might challenge the regime is the military since kim jong il became chairman of the national defense commission however he has promoted 230 generals most of the armys 1 200 strong general officer corps owes their allegiance to him

4313591 she hardly ever wears her wedding ring even off set
4313592 i want her to be happy and its a turn on in a way on the downside though there are guys having sex with your wife
4313593 i look at it as a guy with his dick in my wife but theyre working and its not emotional she never orgasms in porn thats for us if it happened on the set it would be a little weird
4313594 i got a text message from her that said ive been ripped
4313595 get that text and you know its no sex for a few days
4313596 i constantly made epsom salt baths and forced her to get in it burns the cut but also helps it to heal faster
4313597 it wasnt a big deal either way but once you start you cant undo it
4313598 girlfriends of mine call and say that they want to come by for a swim

4313602 we went with a couple of my girlfriends to hang out in their hotel room
4313603 then this music producer dude showed up and all of a sudden these girls were running around in their panties
4313604 one told me that he erased all her movies from his hard drive
4313605 it was hard for me to deal with but my attitude is that if you can find a cool girl good for you
4313606 we urge the government to consider all options in framing its response to the review
4313607 it is essential that the government take into account the strategic importance of the industry when it determines future policy arrangements
4313608 mr bracks finds that the industry needs to continue embracing global competition but also acknowledges the challenges it faces not least climate change
4313609 this can be seen as a threat to the australian industry or as an opportunity to carve out a new niche in the international production system and secure critical export sales
4313610 if it had to be a foreigner couldnt it have been a german
4313611 my experience of managers in england was not that positive unfortunately at nottingham forest i had two different managers whom i would call typical old fashioned english managers
4313612 there is not a good reputation for old fashioned british coaches except for bobby robson because of his personality
4313613 with no disrespect they were more like socialisers hanging out with the lads but now things have changed i think steve mcclaren can do a good job
4313614 he was interested in the passion and succeeded really well in bringing some of that back
4313615 i always wanted to work abroad to experience different countries
4313616 holland has always been a respected football country in england they produce good footballers and good coaches ive only been here six weeks but now i know why you can see why holland has a conveyer belt of talent
4313617 that is in the past i am not worried about my image i know what i have done in the past and this is a new adventure for me
4313618 i am not proving anything although maybe i am proving to myself i am one of those coaches who can travel abroad

4313622 im talking about the impotence and inability of both europe and the united states to be unified and to exert leverage and to comprehend the level of the threat
4313623 he was saying its a difficult situation he said their tanks are 40 kilometers from tbilisi this is where we are
4313624 i think it was presented as you need to sign on to this
4313625 my guess is it was presented as this is the best i can get
4313626 confirmed that the risks are on the downside for growth
4313627 the french economy is not just going through some simple turbulence but is really heading toward a recession at least as bad as in 1993
4313628 its like training an animal to do something by gradual increments
4313629 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing
4313630 we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us
4313631 extraordinarily there is no defence of public interest something which had been in the earlier discussion paper
4313632 the commissions final recommendation is that a legal action should be available to remedy a serious invasion of personal privacy where the individual a had a reasonable expectation of privacy and b the conduct complained about would be regarded as highly offensive to a reasonable person further the plaintiff would have to satisfy the court in each case that c the public interest in privacy outweighs other matters of public interest including the interests in informing the public about matters of public concern and in allowing freedom of expression by including the public interest test covering only highly offensive conduct and placing the onus of proof squarely on the person complaining of the breach the commission has set a very high bar taking into account the concerns of artists and media organisations about respecting freedom of the press and freedom of expression indeed some privacy advocates and civil libertarians argue that we have set the bar much too high
4313633 even if the cause of action had credible defences for the media which is not the case the mere fact of its existence would transform privacy law into one of the hottest practice areas
4313634 i think he came in with a great deal of zeal
4313635 unfortunately i think the first couple of years he has not been able to outline what he wants his legacy to be he pretty much was still trying to deal with some of the things he was left with
4313636 the single largest long term biodiesel sales contract to an end user in the u s
4313637 the termination of or a significant reduction in biodiesel purchased under the rccl biodiesel purchase agreement for any reason including our inability to perform under the agreement would materially reduce our revenue and would harm our financial condition and results of operations

4313656 market conditions continue to be extremely difficult and timberwest is therefore staying the course with its harvest deferral strategy
4313657 with the combination of higher projected future log prices the incremental volume growth of the trees and the expectation of lower projected harvesting costs we believe unitholder value is enhanced by leaving the trees to grow
4313658 by reducing harvests when margins are low and increasing harvests when margins are high the net asset value of the company will increase

4313661 a reorganization would be designed to better match the underlying cash flows of the real estate and timberland businesses with the components of the capital structure
4313662 the company is confident that the value of these businesses is in excess of its current trading price and will remain focused on growing long term unitholder value while preserving a strong balance sheet for the future
4313663 however it is possible that the company may not be able to remain in compliance with its covenants later in the year
4313664 in terms of the risk to people who would be handling this horse on an ongoing basis it would probably be limited information that we would gain from keeping the animal alive
4313665 reading is everything reading makes me feel ive accomplished something learned something become a better person reading makes me smarter reading gives me something to talk about later on reading is the unbelievably healthy way my attention deficit disorder medicates itself reading is escape and the opposite of escape its a way to make contact with reality after a day of making things up and its a way of making contact with someone elses imagination after a day thats all too real reading is grist reading is bliss
4313666 but my ability to pick something up and read it is now entirely dependent on the whereabouts of my reading glasses

4313689 este conflicto fue planificado preparado y ordenado por el gobierno de los estados unidos que lejos de promover el restablecimiento de la paz en la zona se dio a la tarea de estimular las agresiones del gobierno georgiano

4313691 complete unity of purpose between the british and the irish authorities
4313692 the victims their families and officers of the ruc have been let down by defective leadership poor judgement and a lack of urgency
4313693 i would not only resign i would publicly commit suicide if i felt this to be fair
4313694 this resolves the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4313695 the libyans didnt believe that congress would ever be helpful and congress didnt think libya would ever do it
4313696 we found a diplomatic way to accommodate both sides by turning suspicion into an asset
4313697 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4313698 this could not have worked without a great deal of honesty on everyones part
4313699 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terror against american victims
4313700 the signing of this agreement means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve todays agreement is a critical development in moving libya forward on its path toward diplomatic respect
4313701 agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party

4313725 this is a very precious blessing we have in this country which is to vote and if we truly believe this is the promised land and if we truly believe the founding fathers were inspired by god when they wrote that constitution then we need to put a lot of thought into what we do before we go to the polls
4313726 i believe there is a proper role of religion in our society and we ought to promote that and not run away from it
4313727 but i dont think its appropriate to guess which candidate jesus christ would support thats sacrilegious to me
4313728 if anything is more sacrilegious its to claim to be a believer of god and put someone in a tent city because of their ethnic persuasion
4313729 as a man of faith i believe god looks at all of his children equally
4313730 we have everything we need to survive this energy crisis from god
4313731 i think what bennion spencer seems to be doing is a little more unusual and because of that is likely to make some voters uncomfortable
4313732 its pretty hard to figure out what jesus would do on some political questions and i think hes going to make some people a little uncomfortable that he seems so certain
4313733 yeah well the song is decent but its not that good to cause that reaction
4313734 um why you ask is that youre interested or something
4313735 we love dressing up and putting on different kinds of clothes
4313736 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time this upcoming album theater of the mind is an event and all the songs on it are events
4313737 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4313738 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves
4313739 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4313740 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4313741 they did a fantastic job they tried everything they could doing cpr for two and a half hours which is pretty harrowing
4313742 the last thing i would have imagined that gottlieb would have died from
4313743 just play along and itll turn out the right way i promise
4313744 i mean you did try to kill me all those times
4313745 back in the day you used to check me out all the time i thought maybe it was hero worship until i caught you ogling the red speedo

4313749 this will be a major blow to the chances of being named attorney general or appointed to another cabinet position assuming obama gets elected in november and chooses edwards over someone who has been directly involved in politics during the past four years
4313750 i dont know if hell ever be able to recover and return to the work volunteering job he was doing before this
4313751 john edwards needs to step down from or refuse to accept the position immediately
4313752 hes in a lot of trouble if he still needs to be elected to something
4313753 i just hope our tax dollars arent going to him somehow

4313764 strong correlation between the number of payday lenders within a geographic area and the political power of conservative christians within a state
4313765 business conditions continue to weaken in the u s and so far this month we have seen credit indicators deteriorate beyond our expectations
4313766 if we want something now we pay for it in
4313767 we no longer have to dread our bills in january
4313768 i was just surprised because when i saw your report i was looking at the other photos and i was like wow
4313769 i went out the door and my 4 year old is right behind me and she says mommy the grills on fire
4313770 one of them cracked and broke then another one broke and another one broke i just closed the lid and didnt even use it couldnt even use it could not use it because all the heat would be back there and you couldnt cook
4313771 theres no doubt in my mind that it would be just like the other ones if i continue using it
4313772 what im looking for is someone who has a vast amount of administrative experience in managing large and complex organizations
4313773 a vision of where to take the system during the next five to eight years
4313774 you have to like to ride its not just something to do

4313779 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in
4313780 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4313781 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end
4313782 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4313783 when we see the live audience hear their roar hear their appreciation that is the incentive
4313784 every time we keep feeling like oh my god last nights show was fabulous it has been very very overwhelming
4313785 its a mirror image of what happened in the first quarter
4313786 it looks like buyers are still reluctant to dive into this market
4313787 the majority of people look at their home and ask do i have equity in it
4313788 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4313789 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4313790 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4313791 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4313792 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem
4313793 i just thought wed spice things up a little bit today
4313794 it is very unlikely that the philippines will get the same growth rate as last year but it is still seen to achieve a sustainable growth this year
4313795 but a 4 1 percent growth is already positive for the philippines it is a sustainable growth rate for most countries in the asian region
4313796 more room to echo the challenges reduce inflation pressure and allow room for lower interest rates
4313797 once the us enters into a recession we expect it to go on for another two years
4313798 anyone who is growing maybe looking at markets other than the us america is important but its not the only market

4313818 i think its a really good cause and its a good opportunity to raise money for a cause that you and others you know truly believe in
4313819 the money they raise helps the people in their communities

4313825 as ive told one of the citys attorneys we were just forwarding what they wanted
4313826 it was not an endorsement we were asked to submit a letter but we are not advocating on their behalf
4313827 on behalf of the sponsor massillon we are asking your office to reconsider the determination based on three conditions that we said currently exists
4313828 we dont have the ability to approve it recommend it
4313829 if it does not meet the guidelines with the current package theyve the city provided national park service wouldnt approve it either
4313830 why did he send a letter thats crazy thats nuts
4313831 we cannot get cooperation of creating more jobs for economic development

4313834 if legally im told i need to go back and rebargain and sit at the table i will
4313835 but im not going to voluntarily sit down with an organization that had a contract tentatively negotiated and its membership rejected it
4313836 why did they take it back to the membership if they felt their membership wouldnt pass it
4313837 and they walked out if you have one group that doesnt ratify it you dont have an agreement
4313838 she always lets loose on me wheneevr she gets angry i treat her like a little baby and never said anything but for the first time i snap scold and shout she acts like someone stole her ok shut up do you even need to think about this
4313839 its done i knew i would be okay even without her yucks what the hell was i thinking an year ago when i proposed soul mate and all katte yucks
4313840 a girls sorrow is not seen unpaid for you shall suffer and then will realize how much i loved you you are not the one i loved the boy i loved is dead

4313843 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4313845 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4313846 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4313847 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4313848 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4313849 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4313868 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
4313869 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
4313870 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
4313871 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately

4313881 you want to win the gold when you play for the u s its different
4313882 are like the kobe bryants of china they get lots of advertisements
4313883 theyve already brought in legislation which means there can be no more awas australian workplace agreements so they have acted no one can complain about that
4313884 they brought that legislation in in march now theres a second stage of the legislation and theyre undertaking a serious round of consultations and thats to be welcomed
4313885 they are after all political animals and their first concern is a bit of leather in parliament house that they can put their bums on
4313886 what these letters do is they use positive messages about how good it will be on a rainy day and how special you are as a customer to get the offer
4313887 and they try not to use the word debt because that brings home what youre actually doing which is potentially taking on much more debt
4313888 the problem is they then say that nothing should be done about it because they warned customers and all that customers need is more information so they can make their own decisions about these things

4313893 our port visit to umm qasr demonstrates the great confidence we have in our iraqi partners and reflects the marked improvements in security that they have achieved within the past several months
4313894 this visit gave us a chance to interact with senior iraqi navy leadership and further enhance coalition cooperation with the iraqi navy and marines
4313895 making a port visit to iraq and interacting with iraqi officers is very important because it builds relationships and promotes positive interaction between our navies
4313896 today was a once in a lifetime opportunity and i am proud to help make a positive difference in iraqs future
4313897 this is an important day for us and for iraq
4313898 having this ship visit umm qasr is a big step and we hope more coalition ships can visit this port as well
4313899 there has been significant progress in iraq during the past year and a half that allowed firebolt to make this port visit to umm qasr

4313907 you want to jump right into it then alright the key to getting to this world and maintaining it is therapy if every individual is unhappy the society is doomed to be as well it was an uphill battle coming to this point but after enough people found inner peace enough that the average citizen saw that such a thing was possible the self help movement exploded in your time shame was linked to therapy only the crazies needed it now its the central focus of our culture and we cant fathom going without it we teach emotional awareness in preschool and its the most important class
4313908 but just today these people were happy to die for what they believed in the problem wasnt their emotions it was their religion
4313909 it was much more complicated than that but details will only depress you you live in a time where self deception is rampant and as far as religious extremism goes no one strives for heaven when theyre already living it
4313910 whats left to motivate people then doesnt everyone need to fear a kick in the ass

4314000 no practising muslim woman doctor medical student nurse or patient should be forced to bare her arms below the elbow 1
4314001 if giving out the morning after pill is against your religion you cant become a pharmacist
4314002 i hope more here will admit that devil worshippers nazis and serial murderers have a point when they warn about running red lights
4314003 one could solve the entire problem by providing sterile latex gloves that go further up the arm
4314004 your right to swing your fist stops at my nose
4314005 look what happened to the republican party at one time there were reasonable people who called themselves republicans they had reasonable ideas then the religious right co opted the entire party
4314006 same for the mosques the call to prayer is no more disturbing than the bells of st patricks which i happen to live near
4314007 one could solve the entire problem by providing sterile latex gloves that go further up the arm as many american hospitals here in nyc do for the orthodox jewish hospital workers for chrissake if theres a simple solution then why not use it
4314008 but the islamic medical association insisted that covering all the body in public except the face and hands was a basic tenet of islam
4314009 no practising muslim woman doctor medical student nurse or patient should be forced to bare her arms below the elbow
4314010 but i must be honest here and say i am yet to meet a muslim who is so selfish in this manner one of my english literature teachers at school was a muslim though besides the headscarf you wouldnt know it
4314011 oh no not them we didnt like them when they were democrats theyre horrible people
4314012 given the tenuous position of muslim communities here in the west such carping without cause is simply picking on an already dangerously exposed and frequently demonised group and comes perilously close to unacceptable race baiting a post that is distinctly unworthy of you pz
4314013 to save one life is as to save all of mankind

4314015 you sir are nothing more than a bigot hiding behind the shield of science
4314016 jewish law has a principle called pikuach nefesh which not only permits but requires an observant jew to break almost any other commandment of jewish law if somebodys life or health is at stake
4314017 im beginning to think that multiculturalism is ok as long as muslims arent involved
4314018 nobodys suggesting that all muslims or even most are this crazy
4314019 go perform an anatomically improbable act on yourself insanity shouldnt get a free pass regardless of whether its muslim insanity christian insanity or any other flavor
4314020 one thing im curious about after reading that article and i dont think it has been mentioned yet is how medical procedures are performed on muslim women
4314021 what lilly de lure in post 75 fails to understand is that while no one here thinks nor ever even states that the insane freaks mentioned in the article represent all the deluded humans who believe islam if any college medical school etc ever gives in to any of these disgustingly idiotic demands all muslims will have an excuse to whine and cry for all to receive them
4314022 you know its interesting how people outside a religion come up with these weird and illogical
4314023 oh i know there are some bad eggs in that bunch but really now we cant say being muslim is wrong can we
4314024 only help the non jew if it will help the jews
4314025 i can see that logic is not your strong point
4314026 and were talking about not bending over backwards to accommodate medieval stupidity of a degree found only in a small minority of adherents of either of the above religions not about molesting anyone in any way
4314027 which is why it is ridiculous to pretend that the sort of gross generalaisations contined in the original article apply to all muslims of course what all those muslim groups you mention have in common is the stereotyping and profiling of them in contemporary western society as potential terrorists and misogynistic religious fanatics
4314028 you could also say the same about the many branches of judaism and for that matter could most definitely say that same thing about people of the same
4314029 its funny how this mockery is coming from a culture who had no idea of cleanliness until they mingled with muslims during and after crusades
4314030 yeah i know youll call me a bigot and coo and murmer about how enlightened and tolerant you are but until you actually have to deal with a true muslim not the sniveling weaklings who cannot or will not live up to the prophets call or a true xian one who fights satan not the cowards who just go to church or a true jew one who knows only they are chosen and the rest of us are all oh yuck gentiles you are just so many twittering tolerant boobs lining up to be sent to the gallows for the infidels
4314031 but the whole point of what we have been saying is that muslims have been doing no such thing and that this is a scare story if they had i would be pointing and laughing at the fools who wanted the exemption rather than at muslims as a whole see comment 92 now do you see what we are getting at
4314032 no practising muslim woman doctor medical student nurse or patient should be forced to bare her arms below the elbow
4314033 exposed arms can pick up germs and there is a lot of evidence to suggest skin is safer to the patient if covered one idea might be to produce long sterile disposable gloves which go up to the elbows
4314034 a number of muslim females had difficulty in complying with the procedures to roll up sleeves to the elbow for appropriate handwashing
4314035 mcb spokesperson on halal meat and food for the muslim council of britain
4314036 dude im a muslim and this is not right hygiene is essential in worship and daily life the lady should do it or quit down to her but again jumping on one imbeciles dumb interpretation of teachings to blanket ridicule all muslims is wrong come on you know its unfair
4314037 indeed i too am growing tired of professor myers always singling out the religious beliefs of muslims alone for ridicule
4314038 im sure that to any vaguely reasonable interpretation of islam that none of this would be a problem in any way but my point is that there are people out there speaking loudly for islam in a way that makes it look terrible why is no one jumping up and down on them and instead blaming non believers for getting the wrong impression
4314039 a few muslim medical personnel are behaving like idiots and some batshit lunatic muslim equivalent of bill donoghue has their back
4314040 important point pz is no malkin his anti religiosity is equal opportunity i dont know why some commenters here think he is waging a special crusade against islam if anything he usually focuses much more closely on christian whackjobbery than on the muslim version probably because the former is the overwhelmingly dominant variety of whackjobbery where he lives
4314041 they need to change their practice or else change their profession
4314042 mrs tilton makes a legitimate point the claim made by this article is based on a fallible induction that makes a generality on islam as whole based on an instance where a lunatic happened to be muslim if this not the case then it should be simple for mrs tiltons critics to produce proof where islamic text would endorse this sort of lunacy
4314043 the fact of the matter is there are some medical students who are refusing to act in a manner that is expected of them it is perfectly reasonable for those students to be told either they follow the guidelines reach a compromise that is workable separate scrub areas would likely be unworkable for example or leave medicine
4314044 no practising muslim woman doctor medical student nurse or patient should be forced to bare her arms below the elbow
4314045 what makes you think that youre different in principle with your magic pixie dust explanation for consciousness from people who reject the germ theory of disease
4314046 wait a second have i just walked in the wrong door
4314047 aha i told you so we have to protect ourself from these terrible muslims
4314048 better you remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt

4314062 older people are among the prime contributors to climate change but also potentially some of the first casualties there is an urgent need to exploit synergies between climate change policies and policies aimed at older people and to avoid duplication and contradiction older people must be part of the solution we need to make it easier for them to conserve energy use public transport and maintain crucial social networks that will help them better cope with the effects of a changing climate
4314063 two enormous but utterly predictable waves will be rolling across the global landscape in the coming decades the ageing of our populations and the effects of climate change whatever other political and social policy changes will command our attention these two challenges will be constant and unrelenting older people are likely to be physically financially and emotionally less resilient to climate change and government strategies will need to address this

4314067 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way

4314120 theres a huge gap between pure academic research and business research
4314121 everything else falls through the hole in the middle and gets taken up overseas
4314122 australia misses the people that sit in the gap in countries with high technological spirit like the us theres a whole pop of people who are comfortable sitting in the gap
4314123 the sorts of things were talking about you have to start from somewhere
4314124 theres no venture funding for something like this in australia so its great to be able to step back and try to make a real change and do a relatively high risk project
4314125 academics blame industry and vice versa and the government policy tries to push the two together which i think is the wrong thing to do
4314126 i think the academics doing its research should be seen as just as important as industry pursuing its own goals
4314127 i think our project is one that sits in that gap and i dont believe you can always drag pure university research towards commercial relevance i think if you can fund the gap both sides of research can benefit each other
4314128 between 2005 and 2007 our revenue increased by 200 percent

4314137 he is realizing that sometimes you have to deal with the devil to govern
4314138 lugo probably concluded he needed at least short term marriage of convenience to get things done during the first 100 days that will be critical to get political traction and momentum
4314139 is a pretty conventional economist hes going to be reassuring to investors and the international financial community

4314192 george bush is in trouble our people did not find any wmd in iraq can you help us
4314193 can we prepare something for that we could bring in some nuclear material from the former soviet union and pretend they are iraqi
4314194 they come in the summer of 2003 bringing in iraqis interviewing them
4314195 then they start talking about wmd and they say to these iraqi intelligence officers that our president is in trouble
4314196 but the guys were thinking this is absurd because anything put down would not pass the smell test and could be shown to be not of iraqi origin and not using iraqi methodology
4314197 vamos a dar dos semanas a los compradores durante este tiempo les prometemos que vamos a llevarlos es un periodo m s que suficiente

4314202 en la preparaci n hab a jugado buenos partidos y quer a recuperar esas sensaciones aqu todos suman estoy satisfecho pero especialmente por el comportamiento del bloque ahora tenemos equipo para competir con todos y desde luego no vamos a tener miedo ante estados unidos no podemos descartar una victoria
4314203 you may surely eat of every tree of the garden but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die
4314204 did god actually say you shall not eat of any tree in the garden
4314205 we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden but god said you shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden neither shall you touch it lest you die
4314206 you will not surely die for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil
4314207 by the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground for out of it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you shall return

4314212 we have observed that some of the people leading the violence are foreigners because they speak a different language and they do not understand our local languages
4314213 also the tactics they are using are not peculiar with zimbabweans because they are cutting out the tongue removing eyes and genital parts we are not sure where they come from
4314214 there are between six and 10 foreigners in each base and there are 20 zanu bases in the two constituencies
4314215 the tongues are from much farther up north kenya uganda or rwanda
4314216 people are very scared of them because they know no bounds
4314217 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays

4314226 todays kitchen designers want us all to pretend dirty hands and dirty dishes arent the norm and so all such unpleasantries must be hidden away
4314227 as wonderful as the dishwasher is i wonder what we have all sacrificed in sparing generations of children from the tradition of washing and drying the dishes what lessons have gone untaught what revelations have stayed untold because this post meal gathering has been done away
4314228 gold has arguably exited a period of strong investment demand with profit taking and seasonally soft fabrication both working against gold
4314229 any activity with a logical connection to a procedure health service or health service program or research activity this includes referral training and other arrangements of the procedure health service or research activity
4314230 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
4314231 i think there are other strategies and tactics that get us far closer to advancing the cause of human life
4314232 they would absolutely have to be at the end of their tether to call the police
4314233 a lot of parents dont even know they can call the police with these kinds of issues its absolutely the last step
4314234 parents are trying to compensate for not being available they are generally wanting to give their kids the best
4314235 then the kids just start to use quite bullying tactics and slowly over time they will start to up the ante until they are smashing things and becoming quite abusive
4314236 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4314237 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4314238 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4314239 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4314240 i know how you feel my mom makes me ride in the stroller too
4314241 youll want to be with your friends and you wont go walking biking and swimming with me like you do now
4314242 in ten years youll be too old to do all those things anyway
4314243 grandpa did you see that that person wasnt wearing a helmet
4314244 well dont wake her up just tell her i called by the way what are you doing
4314245 dad i know that babies come from mommies tummies but how do they get there in the first place
4314246 you dont have to make something up dad its ok if you dont know the answer
4314247 dont you know theres a war going on over there
4314248 thats the man who made this camp possible maybe youve seen his picture on his salad dressing bottle
4314249 well youve probably seen his face on his lemonade carton
4314250 whenever you need to go to the bathroom hold up two fingers
4314251 grandma i think you should try to figure out some of these on your own
4314252 lord why on earth did i invite all these people to dinner
4314253 i cant read i cant write and they wont let me talk
4314254 mommy cant come to the phone to talk to you right now shes hitting the bottle
4314255 sometimes parents point their kids to heaven while they lead them to hell
4314256 it is the most important weapon in the terror arsenal of robert mugabe hundreds of thousands of new notes arrive weekly in zimbabwe and pay the security forces which put down dissent
4314257 with the production of notes we undertake a sovereign task and take no positions as regards to individual customers
4314258 we are looking at a deeper hit on the financial sector and a wider travel ban
4314259 the test is targeting those members of the regime who are propping up mugabe
4314260 why would china and russia veto a resolution aimed at 14 people who are directly responsible for the maintenance of the regime
4314261 the answer they have given is this is not a regional crisis when you have got four million refugees i dont see how you can say its not a regional crisis
4314262 to track the wealth and the assets that are owned by members of the mugabe regime so that we are in position to take tougher action at a later date
4314263 i reserve the right that we will come back to the united nations if mediation does not succeed and bring forward a further resolution quickly rather than taking months
4314264 the eu and america will continue our sanctions and continue to block the sale and delivery of arms
4314265 t he violence that preceded the election of june 27 meant that the election was fundamentally flawed
4314266 an inclusive and peaceful political settlement that reflects the will of the zimbabwean people
4314267 im confident that if this community wants this zoo to be here and their willing to come together and work with us we can make sure this zoo is not only here for the community but that it becomes the regional zoo it has the potential to be
4314268 its been too hot lately theres just no way i could have done it
4314269 oh my what is this huge purchase at a store ive never been to
4314270 the rising cost of food fuel and the day to day cost escalation were dealing with in our homes were feeling the same thing in this school district
4314271 it was through his cheek and then it went through his shoulder and went out the other side of his back
4314272 they said it was close to his spine but it was just above it
4314273 so everything was real good it just went through muscles
4314274 well intentioned gesture of securing for him for his sixteenth birthday an inscribed copy of atlas shrugged
4314275 the rowers are in for quite a few chances of winning but when racing comes at the olympics it really is difficult to consistently come up with your good results
4314276 the olympics put a lot of pressure on you and people have got to be aware of that
4314277 im just hoping they do all strike it lucky and get the first couple of races under way and get a good roll on it then if the first couple start winning you never know what happens
4314278 i got the first one under way and once that happened i knew there was nothing going to stop me i knew i was the best and the whole team sort of got in that same vibe and we just suddenly felt invincible
4314279 i wanted gold this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4314280 the quality of mercy is not straind it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes
4314281 this is an exciting day for the penguins and our region and we will be proud to be the anchor tenant of this new multi purpose facility
4314282 we look forward to opening the nhl season here in october 2010
4314283 players ages 28 and younger who will end up in the hall of fame
4314284 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4314285 it was not only the army that rose in its defense but also regular citizens
4314286 the planes came in and they started to bomb the ground was covered with dead people and there was nowhere to go
4314287 the people that died they died from their houses falling in on them from the shrapnel and from concussions
4314288 we are all people whether good or bad we all want to live and speak our native tongue we have long been denied the opportunity this is the reason why my family and i have lived in moscow for several years now this is the reason why all of us have russian names we realise that it is a lot safer to be with russia and in russia
4314289 we gathered in front of the cathedral of christ the saviour because it symbolises russian orthodox christianity
4314290 i fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve
4314291 do your worst we are ready we shall not allow the blood of our people in ossetia to be mocked we shall do what we must
4314292 the expectation that our two nations could work together as real partners
4314293 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4314294 we expect the united states to adopt a responsible approach
4314295 it is especially important to refrain from any steps that could directly or indirectly be taken by the georgian leadership as encouragement of its revanchist ambitions and prompt a repeat of the tragic scenario
4314296 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4314297 think very carefully about what is going on here we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4314298 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4314299 right now the only people we will have on the ground are those that are required to deliver the human mission our priority is to save lives and alleviate suffering
4314300 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4314301 it seems that america and nato can make a humanitarian intervention when they think it is right but russia cannot make an intervention when it thinks it is right
4314302 in russian eyes the situation already seems like double standards
4314303 lost boys was a massive part of my life it still is you cant crap on that
4314304 la raz n por la cual la peque a yang no fue escogida para aparecer fue porque quer amos proyectar la imagen correcta est bamos pensando en lo que era mejor para la naci n
4314305 what is graphic design going to do for you when youre starving
4314306 in a sense they may see it as economically viable for them to skirt the law and wait to see if they get sued because the exposure is not that huge if they dont get sued
4314307 if they can settle a complaint for less than 100 percent of what they owe people for overtime theyve gotten away with a good deal
4314308 the advantage to a company of classifying somebody as exempt is that the company can make the employee work as much as it wants and the employees only remedy is to ask for more money quit or sue for back wages
4314309 it hinges on whether the employee exercises independent judgment and discretion with respect to matters of significance for the company
4314310 if you dont exercise independent judgment if you perform rote repetitive tasks in accordance with guidelines protocols checklists or established procedures youre not likely to be exempt under the administrative exemption because youre not exercising discretion youre just following the rules
4314311 companies like to give fancy titles to employees because its a costless way for them to make their employees feel valued and it has a corollary benefit of making employees sound like they fit an exemption if the employer has an eye to getting sued
4314312 weve found in these cases that there are established protocols and pathways and instructions and guidelines and ways of doing things that they have to follow time and time again
4314313 you get an alert from a third party software vendor and you know what the steps are to install those updates because you did it last week theres a right way to do it and not a lot of choice in the matter
4314314 or if theres an error showing up on the monitoring software with respect to a router you know you have to check 11 different aspects of the router and when you find the thing that is wrong with the router you fix it and theres only one fix and theres not much choice in the matter
4314315 in the initial meeting i had with him when i said how important is your hair he said you want me to cut it i said well id like you to clean it up a little bit i think he was within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit
4314316 like billy crystal said in analyze that its a process
4314317 you knew he had a natural ability but unless youre in there every day watching the process that he goes through with the tee work and the cage work and all that stuff that he does you really cant associate the two
4314318 again its not a mistake youre born with it but what you do with it is the big difference and he certainly doesnt take the ability for granted from what im seen
4314319 whats the deal with mens and womens air pistol and all the gun events
4314320 there are something like 20 medals in shooting i guess people have guns
4314321 here you have one of the most popular sports in the world
4314322 we have the better case the sport has olympic level popularity now
4314323 what most people dont realize is that the vote to remove baseball happened at singapore in 2001
4314324 its not about getting major leaguers its very important to understand that at the time they did not put another sport in its place it does give an indication that they are prepared to re address the matter
4314325 50 percent of the ioc members are in europe and europe dominates the olympics agenda no doubt about it we want them to know it is a good sport that draws and has done well
4314326 its a huge event that finishes one week before the ioc makes its decision and that was not coincidental
4314327 eight or 10 sports would be out if you applied the same criteria that the ioc applied to baseball
4314328 they havent kicked track and field out despite what happened to marion jones
4314329 if not an issue its an excuse we are tainted there is no question even though mlb is independent from the ibaf we are being tarnished by a situation we have no control over history has shown that there have been some issues and you cant ignore them
4314330 those of us involved in running that event would stand to gain from the absence of baseball in the olympics but none of us feels that way not playing in the olympics would be a real unfortunate blow to millions of people around the world
4314331 we have to explore that its not entirely clear to me that the absence of talent is the reason countries around the world just dont understand how popular baseball is
4314332 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic

4314334 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
4314335 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis

4314337 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
4314338 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
4314339 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
4314340 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
4314341 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
4314342 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
4314343 this is the main reason that carriers such as verizon wireless say they have such strict testing

4314450 prince covered a radiohead song at coachella which displays crafty cultural radar you cant imagine michael jackson having
4314451 hes re established himself as a live act which is the way into the future
4314452 while he doesnt tour as frequently as some when he does its a big deal and in high demand
4314453 in 2007 princes 21 sellouts at the o2 arena in london was the years top grossing engagement at 22 million a remarkable feat he is definitely in the upper echelon of touring
4314454 commercially hes never had the same impact as madonna or jackson
4314455 where madonna is consumed by building her fame prince is consumed by creating an aura of mystery
4314456 in 10 years you can imagine prince opening a theater in las vegas with shows booked 100 days straight
4314457 he makes the music hes always made sound in the moment thats roughly akin to what muddy waters did in his career
4314458 he looks exactly the same as he did in the 80s as long as hes cranking out good music i cant imagine people wont be there

4314464 i had certain people in mind like chet baker mel torme sang i like to recognize the tune with a great marty paich arrangement and tony bennett has the only record of this funny world i wanted to avoid too many obvious choices

4314493 the others detained were three americans who were acting as support and to ensure the safety of the climbers and engage with the authorities

4314525 it was through his cheek and then it went through his shoulder and went out the other side of his back
4314526 they said it was close to his spine but it was just above it
4314527 so everything was real good it just went through muscles
4314528 you dont know me but i feel like ive known you for a long time may i sit and visit with you for a little while
4314529 i mean before she died she asked me to return this album to you
4314530 i met nadine at the diner where she worked i was a scared kid i had run away from home and only had a few bucks left there was nowhere to turn except maybe to become a well you know i had to support myself somehow
4314531 i sat way back in the corner booth so nobody would see me
4314532 nadine waited on me that day she got my lunch then took her break and sat with me asked if i wanted to talk
4314533 she said she knew i was hungry by the way i stuffed my face then she shoved her sandwich over for me to eat too as i ate she told me she had run away from home when she was fifteen
4314534 hey are you okay do you need a nurse or something
4314535 you loved nadine didnt you she told me you loved her a lot
4314536 she said the two of you fought the day she left home she said you begged her to come home but she left anyway said it was the dumbest thing she ever did
4314537 did she tell you i followed her to the city to try to make her come home
4314538 nadine cried when she told me that she said she was so scared about being on her own but she was too stubborn to let you know
4314539 nadine showed me the pictures of the two of you together when she was a kid by that time i was really missing my mom nadine told me i was a lot like her you know stubborn too proud to give in
4314540 we used to go to sunday school my nadine was such a good girl she loved jesus so much i just dont know what happened
4314541 she said she got in with the wrong kids and started drinking she didnt want to go to church anymore then she met billy they started messing around and she got pregnant
4314542 i didnt know my poor nadine she never told me
4314543 she was afraid to tell you thats why she ran away she was afraid youd be so disappointed that youd stop loving her she ran away and had her baby but gave it up for adoption
4314544 nadine read me that chapter about love in first corinthians she told me about jesus did you know she started going back to church just a few months ago said she needed jesus back in her life because she just couldnt live without love anymore she missed her daughter and you so bad she figured you probably never stopped praying for her
4314545 yup she showed me how to know jesus love too thats how i know it was real for her
4314546 after she got to know jesus she wanted to come home
4314547 before she came though she wanted to find her daughter and tell her all about her grandmother
4314548 gracie is twenty three years old now nadine found her and went to see her a week before the accident they made plans to come and visit you together she was going to call you the day she met me in the restaurant she invited me home to her apartment because she didnt want me to end up scared and alone like she did

4314565 i went to a concert today and there was a guy singing how he was sick of russian music radio station nashe radio and things like that and i realised how petty it is
4314566 the fact is we are witnessing a very serious situation a historical process and thats what i wanted to reflect in this album of course the title is not original but after listening to the album it will be clear what its about
4314567 in a sense its a return to our roots its the music we wanted to play when we were kids
4314568 now we had a chance to record this album its dark depressive music not the short upbeat songs that we have been playing all our lives for some reason
4314569 because the cd is a dying form we wanted to release the album it might be our last cd album so we wanted to have a large number of copies released
4314570 good morning beslan good morning chechnya good morning to cops good morning my country my free country a million kilometers of shit
4314571 i used social topics because the situation is amazing it amazes me everybody drops on their knees and cries cool even if they are not endangered nothing threatens them nobody seems to do anything to you if you say fuck off but everybody cries cool i cant understand it so i wanted to express my attitude to it on this album
4314572 speaking of lyrics i used to lower the standard a little use some irony like in songs deflower baby or a bullet for a bourgeois but i speak rather seriously here in every song
4314573 this albums lyrics could be used as poems which i cannot say about any of our previous albums it even scares me a little because the album turned out to be perhaps too serious but there could not be any other album now because the social situation around is such that i have no desire to make a positive entertaining album i think its even inappropriate in the historical process that were going through now
4314574 we are present at exactly the same historical situation only in a different guise and i couldnt help expressing this on the album
4314575 its a commonplace its so obvious that its not even funny anymore
4314576 the hopes that westerners had relied on in europe didnt come true all in all churchill had his pictures taken with stalin despite the harshest criticism the same happens now whatever regime there is in russia the west will never take any radical steps to help radical circles here
4314577 we have come to a situation when the creation of such parties as narodnaya volya is inevitable this is not a call to violence but a lesson from history
4314578 the preservation of the regime that the presidential bunch undertakes is parallel to the course of tsar alexander iii which only gave birth to a wave of terror
4314579 thats what i wanted to speak about on the album if hexogen was rather detached on this album we have made our social position clear from the start were trying to establish ourselves in this historical situation
4314580 we dont answer the question what is to be done
4314581 because the fact of the matter is not putin it lies much deeper thats what we are trying to understand on this album thats why we called it mirror were trying to look into ourselves on this album why we have remained the same slaves we were an attempt to exorcise the slave from ourselves is perhaps what this album is
4314582 it has even influenced the chords if we had everything in major on all the previous albums all the songs on this album are in minor
4314583 it is an homage to all the bands we listened to as kids its very different even from our earlier albums that all sounded different everybody who heard it in its early stages were a little shocked that it was us but it is us whatever it is
4314584 our attitude to the sound has fully changed we recorded it even more live than before on purpose it took us four hours
4314585 we wanted to make an album the likes of which nobody has made in russia before a genuinely garage album we even recorded it in a church we got into debt over it but somehow we paid it off
4314586 it was a landmark concert for me in a way because i grew up on his songs i immediately remembered myself how i was listening to his fatherland of illusions when i was 15 i would have never imaged that i would be singing fed up with misha
4314587 ive always liked his stance too very individual he has never danced to anybodys flute i would always be happy to play with him his new songs show what ddts yury shevchuk and the others have lost as they were chasing after studios he has not lost his sound judgment
4314588 weve staked mostly on making and distributing tape albums as we had reasons to think that live performances arent likely to come our way very soon and at that particular moment they werent likely at all
4314589 i have been involved in the most extreme political camps so i know the inner workings of that all and i can report that all of it is very stupid and disgusting all of it it has to be experienced so as not to get involved in such stuff consciously which is what i do
4314590 i think that in order to live and be creative which is the same thing one has to be free
4314591 just like weve been weve remained a rebellious superrebellious band but the frontline is moving ever deeper and deeper now it is beyond politics ideology religion
4314592 its a blow of course it may sound high blown but really this is the end of a big story he had influenced everyone turned everyones brains around one way or another
4314593 this is very saddening news about yegor punks and anarchists around the world have lost perhaps the greatest legend of soviet era and post soviet era underground to have ever lived
4314594 its a pity about letov whos up next for all his freakouts he was a part of our lives
4314595 do you think that your flirtations with the national bolsheviks in the 90s have helped popularizing fascism in russia and have indirectly paved the way for the current climate in which people are beaten and stabbed on a daily basis dont you feel somehow responsible
4314596 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
4314597 the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are sign in before you can post messages

4314607 jai obtenu deux deuxi mes places cette ann e et je voudrais grimper dun rang ici a t il mentionn cest un tournoi important une preuve mieux organis e que bien des tournois du circuit nationwide jaime le parcours et jaime montr al je naimerais rien de mieux que de gagner mon premier tournoi ici il faut continuer dobtenir des birdies
4314608 je ne me suis pas donn suffisamment de chances de birdies au retour
4314609 sur le circuit canadien il sagit de mon tournoi le plus important a dit le golfeur de qu bec mais ma priorit demeure le tournoi de qualification du circuit de la pga am ricaine lautomne
4314610 je mattends toujours ce quun compte dune vingtaine de coups sous la normale soit la marque battre a t il dit je devrai h ter le pas jai jou de malchance en quelques occasions
4314611 au cinqui me trou par exemple ma balle sest retrouv e dans un vieux divot et jy ai rat une belle chance de birdie jai aussi rat trois roul s de six pieds pour des birdies jai trouv que les verts taient un peu difficiles lire il sagit de sy habituer mais je suis tout de m me satisfait je nai pas commis de bogeys
4314612 jai trouv que les verts taient rapides a t il dit je nai pas commis de bogey et jen suis fier
4314613 jai disput une ronde solide a dit matthew au 18e trou je me suis promen dun c t lautre de lall e mais jai cal un roul de 10 pieds pour le birdie les verts n taient pas leur mieux surtout en fin de journ e mais avec toute la pluie qui nous est tomb e dessus a se comprend
4314614 je serais bien heureux de terminer parmi les 20 premiers a dit blais jai r ussi trois birdies et jai commis trois bogeys cest un bon d part

4314616 the most difficult thing was to answer their question where was god
4314617 most mothers here are tortured because they dont know what happened
4314618 we knew the kids were getting better when they started misbehaving
4314619 i think they the zimbabwe government are sending a clear and unambiguous and unequivocal message to president mbeki to sadc to the african union to the united nations and everyone else that look you people are forcing us dialogue with the mdc but we are not interested we are thugs we are hooligans we are fascists and therefore stop leave us alone we have obtained a mandate on the 27th of june and that is it dont bother us
4314620 and i think as usual you will see a paralyzed sadc that will be a victim of its own inaction and incapacity to understand the extent of the madness the fascism that they are dealing with so its almost history replaying itself over and over again
4314621 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases

4314623 arley was a hard working dedicated and committed member of the cto family selflessly giving over 20 years of his life to the organization
4314624 arley was never shy to do whatever was necessary for the good of the cto and the caribbean region on a whole
4314625 his passing is a tremendous loss not just to the caribbean tourism organization but to the entire caribbean region our prayers and best wishes go out to his wife margaret and immediate family as well as the caribbean tourism family that he adopted in his more than decades of service
4314626 we in the cto family have lost our heart and the caribbean has lost a brilliant passionate and compassionate friend in the passing of arley sobers he was my sounding board my confidant my advisor and my great friend during my years at cto and long before he helped to establish and solidified ctos global reputation as a source of information on the caribbean few people are irreplaceable but arley comes as close as any we all consider ourselves a part of arleys family and mourn our great loss with margaret and all of arleys family and friends

4314657 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4314658 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4314659 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4314660 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4314691 the libyans didnt believe that congress would ever be helpful and congress didnt think libya would ever do it
4314692 we found a diplomatic way to accommodate both sides by turning suspicion into an asset
4314693 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4314694 this could not have worked without a great deal of honesty on everyones part
4314695 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terror against american victims
4314696 the signing of this agreement means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve todays agreement is a critical development in moving libya forward on its path toward diplomatic respect
4314697 agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party

4314783 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come

4314825 dan diantara manusia ada orang orang yang menyembah tandingan tandingan selain allah maka mereka mencintainya sebagaimana mereka mencintai allah adapun orang orang yang beriman amat sangat cintanya kepada allah dan jika seandainya orang orang yang berbuat zalim itu mengetahui ketika mereka melihat siksa pada hari kiamat bahwa kekuatan itu kepunyaan allah semuanya dan bahwa allah amat berat siksaannya niscaya mereka menyesal

4314838 in our letter dated 10 august attached we made a commitment to the meat industry action group miag to hold a special general meeting which would be called irrespective of the outcome of the vote on the pgw partnership proposal therefore the time resources and money that miag will cause silver fern farms to waste on court action defies belief
4314839 on approval of that transaction the new board would hear the issues raised at that special general meeting based on miags issues we have a firm option on the table to be voted on whereas miag requirements are about a process as opposed to a concrete transaction
4314840 miag has already caused considerable disruption to both silver fern farms and alliance group through their actions particularly related to governance and other issues central to the management of both companies
4314841 it is more likely that history would record miag by its actions in destabilising the governance of both companies has in itself been the cause of slowing the progress of industry consolidation
4314842 further to suggest we are treating shareholders with contempt is nonsense we have been meeting with shareholders for the past three weeks discussing the proposed transaction with pgw along with others matters in relation to sliver fern farms and the industry

4314898 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4314899 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4314900 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4314901 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region

4314914 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4314915 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries

4314917 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4314918 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism
4314919 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it

4314925 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4314926 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4314927 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4314928 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4314929 the case law around the country is that post wrongdoing remedies by the defendant are not admissible to mitigate punitive damages
4314930 when ever after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event measures are taken that if taken previously would have made the injury or harm less likely to occur evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence culpable conduct a defect in a product a defect in a products design or a need for a warning or instruction this rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose such as proving ownership control or feasibility of precautionary measures if controverted or impeachment
4314931 a defect in a product a defect in a products design or a need for a warning or instruction
4314932 although relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice confusion of the issues or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence
4314933 a review of case law from other jurisdictions and academic commentary on this subject reveals no consistent rule on the admissibility of such evidence some courts have taken the view that such evidence is almost never relevant in assessing punitive damages other courts however permit the introduction of post occurrence remediation evidence by the defendant as a shield against punitive damages

4314956 its not the intention of the u s to take control of facilities
4314957 i strongly doubt that russian prime minister vladimir putin is going to be deterred by the prospect of a u s humanitarian effort

4314961 i am happy that we have been able to give our countrymen this big achievement which gives us direct entry to the highest level of football in asia right at this moment this is the greatest win of my career
4314962 everybody has fun playing eating and drinking and it is more of a festival despite some serious football at that level

4314973 we do not want you to be uninformed brothers about the hardships we suffered in the province of asia we were under great pressure far beyond our ability to endure so that we despaired even of life indeed in our hearts we felt the sentence of death but this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on god who raises the dead

4314976 tidak ada halangan bagi kami agar kharthoum bersifat nasionalisme akan tetapi dengan syarat ibu kota itu harus bersifat sekuler yakni agama dipisahkan dari negara dan setiap warga negara bisa melakukan apa yang dia inginkan dengan syarat tidak melanggar kebebasan orang lain
4314977 kami tidak mendengar hal itu diawalnya dan kami juga tidak percaya hal ini akan terjadi di akhir pihak yang mendukung pemberontak dan menyeru pemberontak kepada gagasan ini membawa bakteri jahat yang tujuan akhirnya bukan hanya pemisahan selatan tujuannya tidak lain adalah terpecah belahnya sudan pertanyaan yang harus diajukan kepada igad dan mediator adalah beri kami satu contoh saja sebuah negara di dunia sepanjang sejarah yang memiliki dua militer dan kami ingin mereka menjawab dalam term realita negara mereka sendiri apakah mereka memiliki dua militer akankah keamanan nasional negara manapun mengijinkan hal ini
4314978 bahwa jika kedua pihak yang berselisih gagal mencapai kesepakatan damai maka masih ada sejumlah sarana
4314979 tidak ada jalan dihadapan masyarakat dunia kecuali melakukan pemeriksaan terhadap beberapa pejabat sudan secara kriminal atas kejahatan yang dilakukan dahulu dan mengajukannya ke mahkamah icc
4314980 bahwa jika terjadi pemisahan maka utang akan menjadi tanggungan pemerintah sudan bukan menjadi tanggungan pemerintahan selatan
4314981 sesungguhnya kesepakatan damai yang diharapkan bertujuan terbentuknya pengaturan pemisahan selatan sudan secara damai dan yang disepakati
4314982 sesungguhnya pemberian bagian kepada setiap wilayah atas kekayaannya mungkin untuk diimplementasikan di masa datang terhadap setiap wilayah sudan khususnya yang mengalami marjinalisasi secara politik dan ekonomi seperti darfur dan sudan timur
4314983 demokrasi desentralisasi multi kultural multi etnis multi agama dan keyakinan dan multi bahasa negara
4314984 spla tidak akan melanjutkan keikutsertaan di dalam pemerintahan persatuan nasional selama belum ditentukan jadual waktu bagi penyelesaian masalah yang ada khususnya masalah abyei
4314985 setelah hari tersebut ditetapkannya amandemen maka sanksi tidak mencakup aktivitas bisnis di sudan selatan nuba mountain blue nile abyei darfur dan daerah daerah termarjinalisasi di kharthoum dan sekitarnya
4314986 bahwa kedua gerakan meingininkan pengaturan keamanan seperti yang terjadi antara pemerintah sudan dengan spla trhadap kondisi darfur ini sebagai oenegasan bahwa kedua gerakan slm a dan jem ingin menuntut penerapan teks naivasha seputar pengaturan keamanan terhadap darfur
4314987 saya katakan bahwa ini adalah mahkamah kezaliman eropa bukan mahkamah kezaliman internasional
4314988 dengan begitu kamu as tidak memiliki hubungan dengan langkah yang diambil luis moreno ocampo
4314989 laba minyak berada di balik air mata barat untuk darfur
4314990 mereka barat telah membuat rencana detil untuk masa pasca perdamaian sudan di barat
4314991 minyak teluk memiliki urgensi keamanan nasional bagi amerika serikat dan as akan menggunakan segala sarana termasuk kekuatan militer untuk menjamin kepentingan kepentingannya
4314992 siapapun orang amerika yang peduli terhadap tanda tanda politik mengetahui bahwa as tidak berperang melawan iraq demi demokrasi karena demokrasi tidak ada di dunia arab as juga tidak berperang demi keluarga kerajaan di kuwait as pergi berperang untuk menghentikan iraq atas kontrol terhadap satu sumber yang merupakan darah bagi industri dan yang menentukan hidup matinya perekonomian

4315011 how come there are all these women who have possessive husbands whom get jealous of their girlfriends and try to isolate them and yet i pick a man who is the exact opposite and even tell me when i need to hang out with my girlfriends more
4315012 well youre like a nuclear power plant one man alone could not maintain the whole operation if i tried to all by myself there would be a major meltdown

4315015 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4315016 it was the same way last year ive probably practiced with a different team seven or eight times since ive been in the national football league and it never changes that second day is usually a bit more competitive and we had some great work
4315017 tempers are going to flare up a little bit thats the nature of this profession but they were professional enough to back off and players laugh at it and smile
4315018 sometimes when we go against our own team the defense will win and the offense will come out extra motivated because the coaches in the meetings are yelling at you and things like that
4315019 it makes us want to come out and give that extra effort the next practice
4315020 his speed is a little bit deceptive he is a lot faster than people give him credit for he runs well inside the tackles and outside
4315021 i think the scheme that we have is better and the guys that we have
4315022 our inside scheme i think is a lot better than what we had last year with the players you can have the best scheme in the world but if you dont have the talent it is not going to mean anything
4315023 i explained to him that he needed to spice it up because im winning right now
4315024 theyre definitely one of the best teams in the nfc

4315026 wahai manusia sesungguhnya yang menyebabkan kebinasaan umat umat sebelummu adalah apabila mereka mendapati orang yang mulia mencuri mereka membiarkannya saja tetapi bila mereka mendapati orang yang lemah mencuri mereka menjatuhkan hukuman yang berat atasnya demi allah seandainya fatimah putri muhammad mencuri nisacaya aku akan memotong tangannya
4315027 dan janganlah sekali kali kebencianmu terhadap suatu kaum mendorong kamu untuk berlaku tidak adil berlaku adillah karena adil itu lebih dekat kepada takwa dan bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan

4315034 remains dangerous for thousands of years and no nation on earth has developed an acceptable solution for safely disposing of it
4315035 efficiency programs and renewables such as wind and solar can provide more carbon abatement per dollar while avoiding the downsides of nuclear power
4315036 the supposed nuclear revival is a carefully manufactured illusion that seeks to become a self fulfilling prophecy
4315037 new nuclear power plants are not a solution for americas energy needs
4315038 serious questions of safety security waste and proliferation surround the issue of nuclear power until these questions are resolved satisfactorily environmental defense cannot support an expansion of nuclear generating capacity
4315039 and while it can be argued that the actual risks of nuclear power are far lower than the perceived risks and that coal fired power plants have killed a far greater number of people than nuclear energy most communities do not want nuclear plants nearby

4315054 good biblical preaching draws the congregation into the event as paul preaches to the corinthians his presentation of the saving event of gods activity in christs work precedes his interpretation of that work to the people event precedes interpretation while interpretation draws the congregation into the event
4315055 in the biblical text morality is grounded in history or more precisely the moral life of the believer is grounded in the redemptive historical work of god in christs death and resurrection
4315056 god engages his people as participants in the event of his activity he places them in union with the event or to put it another way god draws his people into his redemptive historical work as a participant in the event not as a spectator of the event one must not view the indicative imperative grammatical construction in abstraction from its theological and revelational historical content the content is what gives the construction its rich supernatural relevance and meaning
4315057 the biblical theologian sees application as that which truly comes from the text because he draws the believer into the redemptive historical and eschatological drama of the biblical text the struggles you face in the christian life are the same struggles that the church recorded in the biblical text faced you live between the two comings of god just as the people of god in the biblical text live between the two comings of god their history is your history as their redemption and application was grounded in the promises and the accomplished work of christ so your redemption and application is grounded in the promises and accomplished work of christ you are living in the same life pattern that the church lived in the biblical text and thus the bible is gods document of application
4315058 my life is applicable to the bible how can we be formed by the bible
4315059 as i partake in the passover i partake with those who ate in hushed voices with belts around their waists and their feet shod with sandals when israel was delivered we were delivered when god and his destroyer angel spared israel judgment they spared us judgment the blood on the doorpost that appeased gods wrath for israel is the blood that appeased gods wrath for us whatever happened to them happened to us when they left egypt we left egypt the parents exodus is the childrens exodus israels salvation is our salvation
4315060 12 steps to living the life you think you deserve
4315061 its only through the indicative that people find real help
4315062 the great gospel imperatives to holiness are ever rooted in indicatives of grace that are able to sustain the weight of those imperatives the apostles do not make the mistake thats often made in christian ministry for the apostles the indicatives are more powerful than the imperatives in gospel preaching so often in our preaching our indicatives are not strong enough great enough holy enough or gracious enough to sustain the power of the imperatives and so our teaching on holiness becomes a whip or a rod to beat our peoples backs because weve looked at the new testament and thats all we ourselves have seen weve seen our own failure and weve seen the imperatives to holiness and weve lost sight of the great indicatives of the gospel that sustain those imperatives woven into the warp and woof of the new testaments exposition of what it means for us to be holy is the great groundwork that the self existent thrice holy triune god has in himself by himself and for himself committed himself and all three persons of his being to bringing about the holiness of his own people this is the fathers purpose the sons purchase and the spirits ministry
4315063 this man must be pried from the false christ to which he clings and held closer to the fires of the law until he cries out
4315064 the crucifixion and resurrection are not simply facts indicatives crb that one must assent to they are facts indicatives in which you must find yourself hidden you have died with christ in his crucifixion and your life is hidden with him in god sin shall not be your master you have been raised with him to a new life believe imperative these things and you will walk imperative in these ways this is the mystery of godliness that it springs from the knowledge of christ
4315065 the indicatives of gods gracious self revelation give rise to the imperatives of heart and life conformity to him

4315070 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4315071 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4315072 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

4315119 they may have to make some adjustments get used to going to bed earlier and getting up earlier or in the afternoon in a way its payback for what we all used to do as adolescents delaying our natural sleep patterns by staying up late so often
4315120 some of it is natural but a lot also has to do with some of it we cant help but a lot can be improved by taking care of the underlying medical condition that contributes to poor sleep

4315141 realizing and attaining your own potential value as a person
4315142 i think both are going to be very difficult the 1500 has three rounds and those three rounds are very taxing so i think that is the race thats going to take a little bit more out of me
4315143 what happened in london was that i wanted to run a smart race but it wound up not being a smart race
4315144 i wanted to run basically strong at the end but i got boxed in with about 250 meters to go i wasnt planning that but ill use that as a learning process
4315145 once i got out of that trouble i started to kick hard i wasnt really disappointed but i learned something out of that race
4315146 that was good enough for me thats a good indication that my trainings been going well
4315147 everybody who makes the final especially the 5000 meters has a chance to win the race
4315148 everyone knows he can really run tough anytime he wants at the beginning of the race or at the end of the race so its really going to change everything
4315149 but my thinking is that everyones going to be tough but i also want to believe that my preparation coming here has been fantastic and i want to believe that im going to be ready for any kind of race thats going to develop
4315150 if it is fast from the beginning thatll be better because im used to that the only thing that i have to be very careful about is not to get tripped boxed in or pushed around its important to know my position when im running thats the most important thing and to know when to run hard
4315151 to win a close one like that and to face some adversity is a good thing
4315152 being so far away from things its hard to grasp we got a call in the hotel at 6 20 a m this morning usually when you get a call that early its not good but he assured us right at the start that it was good news he was about to tell us i played today but honestly cant remember a single shot i hit i was thinking about him all day hell be well advised for sure i just hope he takes it

4315302 federer loses to blake at the olympics which im not enjoying very much
4315303 yet a new totalitarian ideology now threatens an ideology grounded not in secular philosophy but in the pervension of a proud religion

4315316 good god john edwards was having sex with the daughter of the guy who taught tommy burns how to kill horses by electrocuting them

4315335 we need leaders in congress who believe in transparency and accountability
4315336 these issues have cast a cloud over jons candidacy for congress and the citizens of community deserve answers
4315337 jon has made leadership by the example the slogan for the campaign this is an opportunity to allow his actions to meet his words
4315338 more excuses and rhetoric will not suffice we need concrete evidence of how powers spent the money that he raised for the children of iraq and we need it today
4315339 as one of the centerpieces of powers campaign the expenditures of war kids relief should be
4315340 concerned a little bit about lighting yes about the noise
4315341 and i am sure some kids will have a little more difficulty than usual
4315342 once its done it is going to be amazing its going to be really nice for them to have their own part of the building
4315343 i think it will be really great for the kids once they get it finished which i think is going to be pretty soon
4315344 they give you time lines when things are going to be done but it never seems to get done on time

4315346 and lets hope we can deal with it in a very quick manner
4315347 for the court to take such extraordinary action on its own indicates the importance the judges place on the case and means that maher may finally see justice in this country as the dissenting judge noted the majoritys opinion gave federal officials the license to violate constitutional rights with virtual impunity now the court has the opportunity to uphold the law and hold accountable the u s officials who sent maher to be tortured
4315348 by making it appear indian with references to hindu scriptures and great poets people will not come to the truth this is a complete turn back from the real bible
4315349 i am sure this bible made in india and for indians will bring the word of god closer to millions of our people not only christians
4315350 work alone is your proper business never the fruits it may produce

4315358 we believe that the court was wrong in its interpretation of the law
4315359 under the courts rationale were a new yorker to be sideswiped by a car driven by an employee of the saudi embassy they could sue for bumps and bruises yet nearly 3 000 families of those innocents who were brutally killed in lower manhattan cannot pursue their claims

4315361 the it industry is in a constant state of crisis it is perpetually short of qualified manpower

4315363 the only thing that really works in retaining people is the proper work culture and environment people will even accept a lower salary if they are happy where they are the objective of every company should be to build a home away from home not a prison without bars

4315427 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4315433 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4315434 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4315450 este es el verano de mi vida y vivo en una nube
4315451 pep guardiola me dijo que ser a titular en el entrenamiento de la ma ana y me dej sorprendido porque la verdad es que no me lo esperaba
4315452 despu s de enterarme de la noticia lo primero que hice fue llamar a mi hermano para que se lo dijese al resto de la familia porque estaba muy contento
4315453 empec el partido con algo de nervios pero despu s fu ganando en confianza
4315454 no s si seguir en el primer equipo lo que tengo claro es que soy jugador del bar a atl tic
4315455 hemos jugado bien y si seguimos as puede ser una buena temporada
4315456 el m ster me quer a ver por la banda pero lo m s importante era jugar como un equipo
4315457 el tema de arshavin debe de quedar solventado en un sentido u otro esta semana porque empieza ya a afectar al rendimiento del equipo
4315458 esta situaci n se est prolongando demasiado en el tiempo y creo que todo se decidir definitivamente esta semana la pregunta del mill n es d nde voy a ir
4315459 para m la familia es lo principal siempre me han ayudado en todo es una cosa muy importante que est n muy bien como yo y yo estoy muy a gusto aqu la gente me trata muy bien por eso se renuncian a cosas pero soy joven y quiero seguir mejorando mi primera opci n era seguir en el valencia
4315460 tenemos un buen equipo no hay muchos fichajes este a o pero esperamos recuperar a gente para el grupo porque la temporada pasada fue complicada estamos en uefa pensamos en la liga y esperemos lleguen momentos muy buenos
4315461 est m s tranquila y eso es lo m s importante para m
4315462 he estado en el valencia he vivido de todo y eso me ha servido para tener m s madurez
4315463 where you innovate how you innovate and what you innovate are design problems
4315464 did you see the pictures from my trip to los osos
4315465 intenci n de ofender el equipo se ha disculpado fue algo inapropiado pero el objetivo no era ofender y as lo hemos dejado
4315466 es de cari o simpat a y reconocimiento que es lo que siente la federaci n por el pueblo chino y su pa s
4315467 del todo gratuita se ha generado desde la mala fe por parte de unos medios que han querido da ar la imagen no s lo de la propia feb sino tambi n de espa a y del deporte espa ol
4315468 mantiene una larga relaci n con el baloncesto de la rep blica popular china con cuyo desarrollo est comprometida y que se refleja en la estrecha colaboraci n
4315469 qui n est discutiendo lo de la foto no entiendo que se hable tanto de este tema
4315470 no estamos acostumbrados a jugar a las 9 de la ma ana pero los alemanes tampoco tenemos que concentrarnos m s no s si nos cuesta arrancar o es otra cosa pero hemos ganado los tres partidos con claridad bueno el de china tras la pr rroga y estamos en cuartos de final que era nuestro primer objetivo
4315471 con la tranquilidad de la clasificaci n ahora hay que intentar conseguir la mejor plaza posible dentro de nuestro grupo pero sin perder la cabeza y quiero decir con ello que si alguien no puede jugar como esta vez jim nez pues no juega no hay que forzar a nadie pues esto es muy largo y adem s no sabemos si es mejor jugar contra uno o contra otro del otro grupo
4315472 hay algunos jugadores a los que les cuesta entrar en la l nea del equipo
4315473 es dif cil jugar en la selecci n porque todos est n acostumbrados a jugar muchos minutos en sus equipos navarro y ra l han tenido adem s problemas f sicos y les cuesta m s si lo consiguen tendremos m s posibilidades porque los dem s est n bastante en la l nea
4315474 aqu no tienes 2 3 d as para recuperar ya que debes jugar cada 48 horas la situaci n nos hace que casi debamos entrenar durante los partidos porque el trabajo del d a anterior no puede ser nunca demasiado fuerte
4315475 he jugado bien el primer set y el segundo tambi n aunque he fallado algunos golpes y se me ha complicado
4315476 estoy muy decepcionado porque este era uno de mis objetivos esta temporada
4315477 ha sido una sorpresa pero el tenis est muy igualado y no siempre es posible una final nadal federer lo normal es que s lo llegue uno o ninguno
4315478 he ganado los tres ltimos partidos jugando a un gran nivel aunque s de las dificultades que tendr con djokovic porque junto a federer es el jugador que mejor se desenvuelve en este tipo de superficies adem s me gan hace poco por lo que s lo que tengo delante
4315479 s lo me preocupa el partido ante djokovic pero para mi estar en una final ol mpica ser a un sue o ganar una medalla ser a impresionante
4315480 estoy muy contento de mi aportaci n de cara a puerta mi posici n es la misma que en temporadas anteriores pero debo correr menos que con rijkaard ya que el m ster me ha pedido que no baje tanto a buscar balones iniesta y keita realizan esta funci n y yo puedo estar m s fresco para llegar al rea
4315481 hace un mundo que no me lesiono ni me acuerdo desde luego esta es mi primera lesi n desde que soy futbolista profesional eso seguro
4315482 por suerte no tengo que utilizar los brazos hubiera sido peor en una pierna en fin no se puede hacer nada espero que esta sea la ltima de mis lesiones con el barcelona y si me ten a que pasar mejor que me pase ahora que no en plena competici n
4315483 y me da igual si es joven o veterano cuando las necesidades aprietan hay que buscar un jugador competitivo lo que yo valoro es al futbolista no la edad
4315484 es un asunto que llevamos madurando desde hace unos d as y que est ah no es de ahora
4315485 es algo que no tiene nada que ver y que no debe influir si viene otro jugador ser para reforzar al equipo
4315486 la lesi n merma las posibilidades de estar para el inicio de liga
4315487 la eliminatoria no est resuelta quedan 90 minutos por disputarse y tambi n es posible que nosotros podamos marcar cuatro goles
4315488 creo que estamos bien pero esa es una decisi n del club si viene alg n refuerzo bienvenido sea y si no la plantilla est capacitada para pelear por todo
4315489 marcar los que sean necesarios todos los delanteros queremos marcar muchos goles el a o pasado consegu ocho si esta temporada son m s mejor
4315490 la supercopa es el primer torneo y vamos a intentar ganarlo como la liga la champions y la copa del rey vamos a pelear por todo la supercopa es un buen principio para empezar la liga con fuerza el objetivo de esta temporada es ganar las cuatro competiciones en las que participamos
4315491 espero que se tome la mejor decisi n y se quede
4315492 seguro que en nuestro estadio habr mucha m s presi n de la que hubo en el veltins arena
4315493 su gol lleg en un momento en que a n no est bamos metidos en el partido es que su afici n apretaba mucho y lo notamos
4315494 cuesta jugar al bal n a estas alturas de la temporada y es por falta de ritmo
4315495 a veces reaccionamos de la manera que lo hacemos como todos los pilotos en el pasado valentino ha hecho comentarios con los que he estado de acuerdo sobre toni el as tal vez la reacci n fue excesiva
4315496 no estar a mal conseguir poner presi n a mis adversarios esta vez en vez de hacer un error como en la ltima carrera
4315497 fue una gran batalla son cosas que se dicen en caliente y a m tambi n me ha pasado
4315498 ahora nos espera un largo camino porque siete carreras son muchas y aunque para ganar a stoner debo ir al l mite no siempre va a poder ser as
4315499 mejor incluso que todo lo que he visto en el barcelona
4315500 somos pacientes porque a n quedan dos semanas luis garc a tiene voluntad de venir al benfica pero todo depende de las negociaciones
4315501 hay m s jugadores en el mercado y malo ser a que un club como el benfica dependiese de un nico futbolista queremos a luis pero sabemos que hay otras opciones en el mercado
4315502 la lesi n merma las posibilidades de estar para el inicio de liga
4315503 es un base puro un jugador acostumbrado a dirigir al equipo y un buen asistente adem s tiene un tiro exterior m s que aceptable por lo tanto creo que puede encajar perfectamente en la estructura de equipo que estamos haciendo
4315504 s que encontrar amos a jugadores para compararle lo que pasa es que yo prefiero definirle m s en general se trata del t pico base que conocemos de siempre peque o y que se caracteriza por organizar el equipo controlar el ritmo de juego y si la situaci n lo requiere tener capacidad anotadora por lo tanto estamos ante un jugador bastante completo
4315505 con los fichajes que hemos hecho para potenciar el juego exterior la l nea de per metro est repleta de tiradores es decir si las opciones que se dan durante el partido lo exigen podemos tener unos porcentajes de lanzamiento importantes
4315506 la lesi n merma las posibilidades de estar para el inicio de liga
4315507 i reached some plains so vast that i did not find their limit anywhere i went although i travelled over them for more than 300 leagues with no more land marks than if we had been swallowed up by the sea there was not a stone nor bit of rising ground nor a tree nor a shrub nor anything to go by
4315508 eso que ha sucedido es una mala noticia para nosotros lo hemos hecho con todo el cari o pero hay quien quiere hablar de esto de forma interesada hemos venido a china y alguien busca el lado negativo quienes lo ven as son los que deben pensar qu es lo que pasa
4315509 ellos se disculparon y no es necesario llegar a m s en ning n momento hubo mala fe o ganas de menospreciar a la poblaci n china
4315510 para m era un poco rid culo por nuestra parte hacer eso el patrocinador insisti e insisti presion porque es la gente que pone el dinero fue s lo una mala idea nunca intentamos ofender o ser racistas

4315513 i think it will be a very positive message and i know that im looking forward to it brewster said
4315514 the exciting thing for me is that it seems like hes really trying to make something positive out of this you look at different situations and try to learn from them because thats all you can do

4315530 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
4315531 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
4315532 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
4315533 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4315534 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4315535 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4315536 he was just one of those guys who was always there
4315537 if you had a question you would go ask floyd
4315538 he had a lot of straight forward good answers for us hes going to be missed
4315539 he always really thought through things well before he made a decision
4315540 i thought it would be so funny to take him a pickle snowcone so i did it
4315541 he took a big bite of it and after he recovered he pointed across a me and said im going to get you
4315542 i guess what i remember about him most was he was the hardest working volunteer i ever knew
4315543 he believed in honesty and wanted the kids to learn that
4315544 he always said that if kids were involved in 4 h they would never be bored

4315548 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
4315549 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
4315550 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
4315551 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
4315552 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
4315553 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
4315554 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
4315555 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
4315556 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4315557 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
4315558 doing what i want bitch playing video games smoking herb and just pure chilling reading things i want to read and giving you my fuckin opinion about it whether you agree or disagree who is to say youre right and the people before you for that matter what you have to say about that
4315559 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4315560 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4315561 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4315562 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4315563 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4315564 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4315565 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4315566 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4315567 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4315568 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4315569 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4315570 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4315571 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4315572 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4315573 101 how not to propagate negative stereotypes when reporting on race
4315574 why are you giving lilah money was there a bet was i a bet

4315584 must say hes bloody hot in the collar and chain and black lipstick but hes taking it poorly thinks you two are making fun of him

4315631 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4315632 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4315633 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4315634 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4315635 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4315636 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4315637 forty percent of the mass of every tree in the forest is crude oil
4315638 could put idaho in the oil business for the first time
4315639 that idiot sali is just an absolute idiot he doesnt have one ounce of empathy in his whole fricking body and you can put that in the paper
4315640 we have not only a hindu prayer being offered in the senate we have a muslim member of the house of representatives now keith ellison from minnesota those are changes and they are not what was envisioned by the founding fathers
4315641 yet the debate over my comments boils down to this should the future of our country rest upon the judeo christian convictions of our founding fathers or the religious diversity advocated by the left i choose the founding fathers the judeo christian principles on which our republic was founded can be embraced defended and practiced by people of any faith anyone doing so will find an ally in me but when principles outside of the judeo christian tradition begin to be promoted within congress we should all recognize that the government given to us by the founding fathers will be at risk that should give every american serious pause
4315642 the prospects in flair bartending are awesome but people here are not well trained we want to tap this potential
4315643 we searched the sanctuary for the calf till late last night but could not find it
4315644 we resumed the operation today and found it yelling near rohini
4315645 there are also chances that rohini was sick and it was abandoned by the other members of the herd
4315646 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around
4315647 she was a rather bizarre character and seems to have a strange circumstance now
4315648 there was a strong aroma about her and i told her this needed to be taken care of before i went to court with her
4315649 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4315650 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4315651 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4315652 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4315653 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4315654 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4315655 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders

4315665 saya sendiri sebenarnya tak tahu persis kejadiannya namun berdasarkan informasi yang diperoleh dari beberapa rekan lain zaki tidak terima ditegur oleh budi saat jam pelajaran makanya setelah pelajaran selesai zaki yang rumahnya tidak jauh dari sekolah langsung mengambil golok dan kembali ke sekolah saat itu budi sudah bersiap siap hendak pulang dengan menaiki sepeda motor
4315666 kita tidak bisa terus hanya memasukkan orang ke penjara karena korupsi keberhasilan pemberantasan korupsi itu harus dilihat dalam pencegahan perilaku korupsi lagipula keberhasilan pembangunan sangat ditentukan oleh kualitas tata pemerintahan yang bersih dan berwibawa
4315667 perwujudan indonesia yang bersih dari korupsi harus didukung oleh kita semua baik dengan menyusun perundang undangan yang baik dan kuat maupun dengan pelaksanaan yang konsisten dan tanpa kompromi hanya dengan langkah ini indonesia dapat membangun martabatnya di mata dunia

4315670 hi my name is kimberly and im a cheerleader from naperville and i am energy
4315671 i am who i am because i did it for myself
4315672 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
4315673 i was shocked when the producers of the show called i even asked you do know im a man right
4315674 an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
4315675 jika rusia tidak mundur dari sikap dan tindakan agresifnya di georgia hubungan as rusia bisa berdampak buruk selama beberapa tahun ke depan
4315676 saya tak melihat prospek untuk penggunaan kekuatan militer oleh as dalam situasi ini
4315677 as menghabiskan 45 tahun dengan kerja keras untuk menghindari konfrontasi militer dengan rusia saya tak melihat alasan untuk mengubah pendekatan itu sekarang
4315678 hari hari dan bulan bulan mendatang akan menentukan arah hubungan as rusia di masa mendatang
4315679 is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
4315680 this is not a defensible position in a situation in which there is evidence pointing in the direction of harmful effects
4315681 in this respect the response of the apa committee to this situation appears to follow the type of logic used by the tobacco industry to defend cigarettes since in our opinion there is no conclusive evidence of harm then the product may be treated as safe
4315682 by the admission of the report studies in this area including my own have significant flaws relating to sampling measurement and confounding what this means is that the best scientific evidence to which they refer is really not all that good
4315683 given that this is true then it would be inappropriate to draw strong conclusions on the basis of such limited evidence the apa report in fact does draw a very strong and dogmatic conclusion that cannot be defended on the basis of evidence since this evidence is lacking by the admission of the report
4315684 ive been thinking about you lately and i thought that id just see how you were doing your brother said youd moved and i well wanted to check in with you see what was doing
4315685 well yeah but what should the name be like should it be sarah or maisy or sally
4315686 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4315687 he came in and showed me as billy crystal said in analyze that its a process he took a little bit off its within the rules of cleaning it up a little bit right now its around his shoulders its not covering his name up well continue to monitor it
4315688 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4315689 so youre just going to take your ball and go home
4315690 saya tak sangka dapat menang semudah ini tumpuan saya hanya untuk memulangkan segala pukulannya kerana saya tahu dia gemar mengasak
4315691 memang saya sedikit gugup pada set pertama tapi selepas itu saya mula yakin dan dapat bermain mengikut strategi yang diatur
4315692 dua dua lawan itu adalah sama kuat jadi tak guna saya fikirkan semua itu kerana lebih baik saya mempersiapkan diri sendiri menghadapi perlawanan itu
4315693 do you like it did i do a good job is it how you wanted it
4315694 you have the republicans which is a party of bad ideas then you have the democrats which is a party of no ideas
4315695 the more you talk about it the more you hype yourself the more you forget that you have to prove it on the field people in the media tag us as the it team and people start reading into that once they read into it they forget about going out and actually playing the game
4315696 historically there have been more issues with johns matches than the other guys but this was over the top
4315697 i guess 1992 in new haven was the last time i played john has anything changed i guess he has one of those explosive personalities you could say
4315698 there are a lot of things i can deal with disputed line calls stoppage in play i have an issue when my opponent starts berating people fans and umpires i said something to the official as players we are in control of the match officials are in charge of the integrity of the game
4315699 he cares about his on court performance more than he ever has in his life
4315700 whatever adelman needs me to do come off the bench be the sixth or seventh man start i dont even care whatever he needs me to do im 100 percent sure its going to work
4315701 this guy really puts us over the top in terms of what we need
4315702 we have a great team to start on the floor and a bench i think were going to go really far
4315703 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4315704 he says every time he gets a hit its the hair i say its the ability he knows as well as everybody else around here that his ability is special hes a character
4315705 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4315706 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4315707 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4315708 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4315709 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4315710 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4315711 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4315712 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4315713 what defenses does georgia have because of the cease fire agreement which russia has not honored georgian troops are being moved to organize a defensive line 10 kilometers six miles away from
4315714 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4315715 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4315716 when you come across something like that in the middle of the desert it sends a tingle down your spine
4315717 everywhere you turned there were bones belonging to animals that dont live in the desert
4315718 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4315719 which suggests he was eating a lot of protein and had an active strenuous lifestyle the kiffian appear to have been fairly healthy it would be difficult to grow a body that tall and muscular without sufficient nutrition
4315720 this mans life was less rigorous perhaps taking smaller fish and game with more advanced hunting technologies
4315721 the most important for him is to take his time and decide if he wants to play or not we are ready to wait for him
4315722 i am waiting for more this season it will surely be hard the only thing that is better than a first place in the east is the first place in the nhl
4315723 i dont think anyone should get in the way of what i want im not going to feel bad if i go out and race my heart out and end up winning
4315724 the most important thing is being able to separate the two races and just most on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me is the psychological part
4315725 he just loves to get in and race the best and that pushes michael and that pushes aaron peirsol
4315726 i think aaron and michael both know that hes a threat when hes on and i think those are going to be two very exciting races to watch
4315727 thats a swim to get me into the meet a little bit
4315728 its been a long week waiting and watching a lot of ups and downs finally im in the meet and i can relax and do my race a little bit better
4315729 i didnt have much speed the first 50 but i think i came home pretty good i just need to put myself out there a little more in the first 50 and ill be ok
4315730 ill just try to set myself up for a good final and go from there
4315731 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4315732 in a sense theyve got obama hostage and are exacting their ransom
4315733 selling the calls like you often see players do in soccer
4315734 the obama nation leftist politics and the illinois senator is a dangerous radical candidate for president the book is a compilation of all the innuendo and false rumors against obama that he was raised a muslim attended a radical black rage
4315735 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4315736 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4315737 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4315738 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4315739 beliau anwar tidak menyerang saya secara terus tetapi menggunakan orang orangnya untuk memburuk burukkan saya di laman laman blog termasuk dalam
4315740 saya akan jawab segala tuduhan itu di permatang pauh nanti untuk membersihkan nama saya dan mendedahkan semua rahsia anwar termasuk sebab sebenar saya meninggalkan beliau anwar kerana sebelum ini saya sudah beritahu jika saya masih lagi diserang dengan fitnah fitnah seperti ini saya akan lakukannya dedahkan rahsia
4315741 saya akan mengadakan banyak perjumpaan tertutup dengan rakan rakan dari umno pkr dan juga pas untuk menerangkan kepada mereka asas asas mengapa mereka perlu mengundi bn dan bukan pkr
4315742 ini bukan masanya saya mahu terus bekerja dan menggempur permatang pauh untuk menentang anwar habis habisan
4315743 apa yang penting saya mahu tunaikan tanggungjawab untuk menyatakan kebenaran dan mendedahkan kepalsuan anwar
4315744 saya yakin jika saya benar benar ikhlas mereka akan dapat menilainya sendiri tidak perlu mengambil hati
4315745 saya mengenali beliau beliau memang seorang yang kuat berkerja berkhidmat dengan cemerlang dan mempunyai rekod hebat kerana berjaya memenangi dun seberang jaya selama dua penggal
4315746 tidak mustahil beliau akan merampas kembali kerusi permatang pauh walaupun ia adalah kubu kuat anwar
4315747 di kota makkah inilah terletak jantung kehidupan agama kepulauan nusantara yang setiap detik selalu memompakan darah segar ke seluruh penduduk muslimin di indonesia
4315748 sultan sultan yang belum beragama mesti tunduk dan memberikan penghormatannya kepada khalifah
4315749 sesungguhnya tidak ada apa yang disebut politik etis di tanah jajahan karena tujuan politik colonial ialah eksploitasi bangsa yang terbelakang walaupun tujuan yang sebenarnya sering disembunyikan di belakang kata kata indah
4315750 sin duda alguna esta ser una de las m s grandes celebraciones del a o en am rica latina
4315751 nuestra visi n es proclamar el evangelio de jesucristo a toda la ciudad raz n por la que pentecost s se ha convertido en una fiesta popular donde la gracia de nuestro se or se manifiesta al hombre

4315753 dado el momento hist rico por el que atraviesa el pa s y el mundo este a o la fiesta de pentecost s tiene un inter s muy especial
4315754 por esa raz n elegimos el pachencho romero y estamos invitando a l deres de todo el continente para que nos encontremos en maracaibo sabemos que d az pab n tendr una palabra de dios para todos y que viviremos un nuevo pentecost s fresco y de actualidad
4315755 un respiro de amor respeto reafirmaci n espiritual y social del individuo

4315757 creemos que la actual crisis que mantiene al 70 por ciento de la poblaci n en la zozobra de una econom a de sobrevivencia es fruto de la aplicaci n de un sistema neoliberal injusto y las repercusiones de pol ticas internacionales como el aumento en los precios del petr leo
4315758 la iglesia debe responder con contundencia a esta grave crisis alimentaria que nos amenaza de manera tan real y cercana un llamado a solidarizarse para que los m s pobres no padezcan hambre
4315759 un hombre de dios y como mois s es l der de una gran multitud
4315760 la multitud rompi en un extenso aplauso que termin con una ovaci n de pie
4315761 c mo har n ahora a la luz de la nueva informaci n sobre las creencias de hagee para cancelarla invitaci n o dar n giros y vueltas para darle un argumento racional a su continuo apoyo a este falso testigo
4315762 hagee ha hecho m s que ning n otro cristiano de nuestra generaci n para mostrar amor a los jud os y para apoyar con fuerza a israel hizo alg n comentario sacado de contexto sobre hitler que seg n alg n blogger liberal lo convierte en antisemita
4315763 con una pesada carga de estereotipos calumnias y teor as conspirativas antijud as una de las cuales era tal vez la favorita de hitler
4315764 la supuesta camarilla banquera internacional jud a encabezada por la familia rothschild que controla los destinos de la naci n entera incluso la progresi n de los eventos y de la historia del mundo a trav s de la manipulaci n de los mercados financieros internacionales
4315765 la profec a esperada por hagee y su feligres a de la invasi n y desolaci n de israel y su divisi n en 12 unidades administrativas denominadas por cada tribu de israel
4315766 pocos jud os estadounidenses sopesan la magnitud del odio hacia ellos que emana de los p lpitos y de las redes televisivas evangelistas
4315767 la propaganda ha sido ligeramente codificada pero al fin y al cabo no es muy sutil m s que denostar directamente a los jud os los predicadores y l deres fundamentalistas cristianos han denostado a grupos e ideas asociadas para bien o para mal con los jud os
4315768 what if he gets lost trying to find his classroom one day

4315776 while we respect our endorsing process in the republican party some things rise far above process and party in terms of importance the integrity and character of our candidates and elected officials are two of those things
4315777 combines excellent conservative credentials with a high degree of personal integrity and character
4315778 we must maintain and uphold our beliefs that violence of any kind whether it is in word or in deed should not be rewarded with our partys support
4315779 it is an embarrassing and sad fact but if representative olson wins in november he will become a more influential member of the minnesota legislature because he was arrested charged tried and convicted of domestic assault
4315780 to win a close one like that and to face some adversity is a good thing
4315781 the one thing i want to make sure we do is make sure kurt gets some time with the first team
4315782 being so far away from things its hard to grasp
4315783 queremos bajar el mercosur a las provincias para que estas se sientan m s part cipes de la integraci n nos interesaba comenzar por tucum n porque el etanol es un tema que est en la agenda del mercosur
4315784 our business model echoes the same business model which led to
4315785 we record each and every session that is being delivered also we have given clear instructions to all our tutors regarding the online safety for the students
4315786 what the republicans have found is that a direct attack on social security or direct attack on medicare is worth their political life
4315787 its the third political rail what they want to do is bleed it to death
4315788 its trash time and a lot of decent people think where theres smoke theres fire and the way to cut through that smoke is to talk to each other
4315789 its a chance to sign up volunteers get lawn signs get your neighbors to be part of the process

4315791 ouch i think i locked my keys in my car

4315793 overall the farm sector still lags its potential due to underinvestment in previous years the full year production could also be hampered by high fertilizer and oil prices
4315794 the demand side is a major concern supplies from opec countries are rising but there is a shortage of buyers the industrial use in china has been cut back
4315795 we just think its incongruous that the report points to several adverse effects on the species but in the end it turns the report on its head and concludes that it wont result in the extinction of those species
4315796 the standard we must go by is whether those impacts will result in jeopardy to any of those species
4315797 were pretty confident this lawsuit is just a delaying tactic
4315798 unfortunately this is whats become of the environmental process this is why it takes forever to build infrastructure projects
4315799 its unlike anything weve seen in the trading card category said hackler whose company is an industry leader in collectibles pricing

4315803 the jackals are already sniffing at our body assuming its a corpse seeking to take whatever they can find to build their own schools were not dead yet at least wait until the corpse is cold
4315804 sen obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle class wage earners
4315805 thats why his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000 not income taxes capital gains taxes dividend or payroll taxes
4315806 the reality of barack obamas record is the following he has voted to raise taxes 94 times in his short time as a senator
4315807 barack obama can say it but it doesnt make it true
4315808 the opinion piece that we saw today in the wall street journal is part of a path that obamas taking which takes him back more towards the middle more towards mccains policies
4315809 were pleased to see that because there is tremendous uncertainty over obamas plans for the economy and for the stock market and for the markets overall

4315841 the worldview is we have to get back to a catholic civilization they want to go back to a christian society imposed from above its just another world they want to build
4315842 i thought it was disgusting and now i dont want another guy to kiss me before marriage
4315843 in high school i found myself looking at every girl and asking has she given up her virginity is she still pure here ive stopped asking i know everyone is
4315844 here at ave maria we follow the teachings of the magisterium
4315845 we have not prostituted ourselves other catholic schools and the rest of america have embraced modernism and the culture of death they have given wholehearted support to the death penalty abortion and euthanasia the value of the human person is now entirely relative
4315846 we dont believe in the separation of church and state
4315847 and this country should orient itself toward christ the foundation of western civilization rests on christendom which means that america owes its existence to the catholic church
4315848 we saw an environment where the free expression of the human spirit is thwarted
4315849 that whole organization is basically run like a sole proprietorship
4315850 most of the very competent people who knew how to run universities either left after a while or were pushed out
4315851 spoke of high academic aspirations and their personal devotion to mary and to the catholic church

4315868 this isnt an admission its an admission that life is short
4315869 and rather than spend her energy fighting a lawsuit without end she decided shed rather devote her talents and time to making positive change in our society
4315870 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and i am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity

4315878 dia sadar bahwa dia manusia biasa dia masih punya allah yang mengatur hidupnya yang aku tahu dia akan selalu berusaha tapi dia tidak menjanjikan apa apa soalnya dia tidak tahu apa yang akan terjadi pada kita dikemudian hari entah kenapa itu justru memberikan kenyamanan tersendiri buat aku
4315879 dunia ini fana apa yang kita punya hari ini belum tentu besok masih ada iya kan paling gak aku tau bahwa dia gak bakal frustasi kalau suatu saat nanti kita jadi gembel hahaha
4315880 estoy satisfecho por el trabajo realizado el resultado es lo de menos hemos hecho un buen partido en l neas generales y debemos seguir en esta l nea nos cost salir desde atr s con fluidez si no piensas r pido es complicado ante un equipo de primera lo importante es que nosotros lo sabemos y estamos en ello para mejorarlo hemos tenido que cambiar el sistema y darle minutos a todos no hemos podido mantener el 4 4 2 y hemos jugado con un 4 1 4 1 que nos ha dado mas solidez en el centro es importante tener variantes
4315881 mi sue o es que salga un nuevo antonio puerta
4315882 siempre he seguido el devenir del segundo equipo y me enorgullezco ahora de ser su responsable el sevilla siempre cuida al m ximo su cantera y as seguir siendo mi deseo es que pronto salga un nuevo antonio puerta y me consta que hay jugadores que vienen apretando desde atr s en esa l nea
4315883 el filial como club de segunda necesita alguien del consejo que lo represente a nivel institucional el club me lo ha encomendado y estoy muy ilusionado
4315884 cada vez es m s dif cil subir a la primera plantilla pero el principal objetivo sigue siendo ese nutrir al primer plantel
4315885 seguir en segunda es una oportunidad muy buena y debemos aprovecharla
4315886 tanto ram n somalo en los escalafones inferiores como yo en el filial trabajaremos para que el sevilla siga siendo reconocido por su trato a la cantera
4315887 el filial ha crecido a la par que el primer equipo
4315888 el crecimiento experimentado por la entidad lo nota tambi n el filial tenemos una plantilla joven pero con futbolistas venidos del villarreal de argentina o de camer n por ejemplo podemos decir que el sevilla atl tico ha crecido a la par que el primer equipo los que lo seguimos sabemos que tenemos jugadores de primera como hace muy poco lo eran capel fazio crespo varas o david prieto formamos futbolistas para nuestro equipo pero si aqu no tienen hueco est n preparados para jugar en otros clubes
4315889 saya baru saja disuruh keluar oleh anggota mereka pleno di dalam tetapi tak seorang pun selain anggota dewan yang boleh mengikuti pleno kami semua sekwan disuruh keluar
4315890 tapi kita juga akan tahu apa isi rapat itu pak diam diam saya sudah tekan tombol on di mic mereka jadi seluruh isi pembicaraan di dalam otomatis akan terekam mereka tidak mau tahu yang seperti itu
4315891 pak ada berita baru kemarin mereka semua ternyata membahas laporan pertanggungjawaban pimpinan eksekutif di kota ini mereka bilang bahwa jika lpj itu mau mulus finalisasinya maka masing masing anggota minta avanza satu buah semua anggota minta itu kecuali seorang yang memang anti dengan yang begituan cuma seorang yang menolak jika tidak diberikan maka lpj nya akan diganjal
4315892 ya kenyataannya demikian pak jika bapak tidak percaya saya masih menyimpan rekaman sidangnya lengkap pak
4315893 saya tidak mau jadi anggota dewan bukannya apa apa kalau saya jadi seperti mereka saya takut lebih pintar cari duit ketimbang mereka
4315894 demikian alasannya mengapa dia terlihat selalu beberapa hari setelah peristiwa itu saya kembali bertemu dengan anggota sekwan namun bukan si bapak tadi
4315895 sebagian dari yang 30 itu buat dana thr anggota dewan kitalah yang harus menyediakan karena dalam anggaran yang resmi
4315896 di sana maksudnya di institusi legislatif pusat semua macam godaan tersedia
4315897 i feel excellent my legs are strong and fast my mind stays positive as it should be i have said one thousand times i will give all of me in the field
4315898 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4315899 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals
4315900 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
4315901 could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
4315902 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4315903 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4315904 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4315905 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4315906 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4315907 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4315908 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4315909 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady
4315910 the increase is a troubling sign for estuarine and coastal waters which are among some of the most productive waters on the globe
4315911 this resolves the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4315912 the libyans didnt believe that congress would ever be helpful and congress didnt think libya would ever do it
4315913 we found a diplomatic way to accommodate both sides by turning suspicion into an asset
4315914 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4315915 this could not have worked without a great deal of honesty on everyones part
4315916 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terror against american victims
4315917 the signing of this agreement means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve todays agreement is a critical development in moving libya forward on its path toward diplomatic respect
4315918 agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4315919 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4315920 though it wouldnt go far enough in reducing the use of menthol flavors favored among african american smokers
4315921 o roberto me abra ou no palco e agora me convidou para cantar com ele durante o cruzeiro no ano que vem
4315922 me hizo sentir mal del est mago mi respuesta simplemente fue realmente me est s preguntando eso ella solo tiene 14 a os y tu eres un ped filo
4315923 lo que trato de decir es que crec con una hermosa familia apoy ndome claro que tenemos altibajos lo normal pero mi madre nos ense a ser agradecidas con lo que nos han dado ella nunca alentar a o permitir a que una chica de 14 a os alterara su cuerpo
4315924 is very important because it allows me to talk about the programs we have in the office that have a substantial impact on caribbean countries and the caribbean community here
4315925 i have to be cognizant not only of where we are but also of where we want to be in the future
4315926 this is about creating a voice that tells people who the people of the caribbean are

4315928 thanks to yelp and the sales person at keetsa buying a mattress was surprisingly easy
4315929 uh oh milo youre just going to have to keep sleepin on the air mattress for a few more months
4315930 im not supposed to go this low on this mattress but
4315931 is there any special sale i should be aware of today
4315932 yes there is a sale but it depends on the model and type let me show you how many springs this mattress has
4315933 its not any closer to being a park than it was two years ago
4315934 we have agreed to move as soon as an alternative location is found that allows us to do what we need to do
4315935 we thought it was the mta that was dragging their feet but actually it was the city
4315936 the need to relocate the existing mta facility and acquire parcels were known challenges from the beginning
4315937 matt bauman is back but shawn doman and matty ah you have done a good job some freshmen linebackers are looking good too like iona pritchard and then our defensive line is stout

4315939 he has indicated he is not a rich man and cant live abroad
4315940 we hope that in the interest of the good of pakistan and for the good of the country that mr musharraf takes the right course and resigns before the impeachment process begins
4315941 official action has to be taken by him and he has not yet taken the action
4315942 a place that may ultimately reveal just exactly what kind of environment habitable or not we have within this tortured little moon
4315943 knowing exactly where to point at just the right time was critical to this event
4315944 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a distant roadside billboard with a telephoto lens out the window of a speeding car
4315945 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way
4315946 there appears to have been extensive fallout of icy particles to the ground along some of the fractures even in areas that lie between two jet source locations though any immediate effects of presently active jets are subtle
4315947 for the first time we are beginning to understand how freshly erupted surface deposits differ from older deposits
4315948 over geologic time the eruptions have clearly moved up and down the lengths of the tiger stripes
4315949 isnt it amazing what can happen on a planet that has water on it
4315950 they see this as an opportunity to test american mettle
4315951 the situation in universities in germany is depressingly bad compared with other countries
4315952 soapbox speeches by politicians are no replacement for security policy
4315953 we need to interest young engineers physicists and technicians in the nuclear sector
4315954 there is a sense that he may no longer be with us
4315955 if the reports are true it would be a significant victory
4315956 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors
4315957 probability of success in actually overthrowing any government is close to zero
4315958 nesta sexta feira espero estar num rendimento ainda melhor e baixar o meu tempo

4315960 have fun do whatever you want make me look good
4315961 its the total package we kind of call it the new york city problem
4315962 the root of it is that hes been out of touch with minnesota for so long that he didnt understand that we dont talk like that here
4315963 nous devons nous attendre une rencontre difficile face au nigeria le prochain quart de finale sera donc un choc entre deux quipes africaines qui se connaissent parfaitement cela devrait donner lieu un match int ressant nous avons de bons joueurs alors esp rons que nous pourrons continuer sur notre lanc e

4315970 we live literally a few blocks away so i am a little biased but the sushi is truly to die for
4315971 this is the kick in the butt i needed to crank out a film every 4 months
4315972 they would absolutely have to be at the end of their tether to call the police
4315973 a lot of parents dont even know they can call the police with these kinds of issues its absolutely the last step
4315974 parents are trying to compensate for not being available they are generally wanting to give their kids the best
4315975 then the kids just start to use quite bullying tactics and slowly over time they will start to up the ante until they are smashing things and becoming quite abusive
4315976 when my boyfriend and i recently moved into our new place together i discovered that i absolutely needed to get a dresser
4315977 oh yeah i could use one of those and some of that
4315978 it better not have any scratches it better be in its original box it better be sellable and you have to bring it here and let me see it
4315979 i like refried beans but maybe fried beans are just as good and were just wasting time flash forward to the summer of 99 and my arrival in the golden state i learned a new lesson taco bell sucked you could go elsewhere for the magical burrito and there were lots of places to buy them wow i can get fat at a variety of establishments wonderful i then learned that the best place to get burritos was in the mission however whenever i ventured into the mission i got dirty looks from people these people wore black had pierced parts of their bodies that i did not know could be pierced and seemed to hate clothing that has either a collar or buttons or heaven forbid both i was told that these are hipsters they are cooler than you hate your madras shorts and collared shirts and dont want you in the mission thats where la canasta saved me this is exactly the kind of mexican take out joint that prevails in the mission except there arent a line of pretentious hipsters inside giving you dirty looks because own a razor and wash on a regular basis most importantly it is in a great location and i can walk down the hill to get there the portions are awesome sometimes too big to finish who am i kidding i always finish their burritos just ask my tailor the ingredients are in good proportion to one another the shrimp burrito is excellent probably because they put more than two of those little critters in there i wish they gave you some complimentary chips but then my tailor would be apoplectic i cant take out these pants anymore lose some weight instead my only complaints are that i wish they stayed open a little later and were a little speedier the ordering area is a little tight as well another reason to pass on the chips i might not fit in there otherwise ive been here numerous times in the last few years 90 of the time the food is great 10 it has something to be desired the nachos are consistently good ceviche has always been great and the burritos are usually good but not guaranteed the best part of la canasta is the people who work here theyre always friendly and welcoming despite being crowded i grew up in an area with great mexican food and la canasta makes me feel right at home i work in the neighborhood and this is the only decent place on union st actually its the only place on union street for mexican food i could walk to chestnut but dealing with marina folk tires me out too much that and im lazy i usually switch between burritos tacos or the chicken tortilla soup all the meat is really good but i usually get the carnitas good thing my boyfriend isnt kosher my co worker gets the enchiladas all the time but i wasnt that impressed with them let me just say something about the soup it was really really weird at first the broth is red which i was not expecting the first sip has a tomato y taste i thought great thanks coworkers this shit sucks but then the next thing i knew it was five days in a row later of chicken tortilla soup for lunch the tortillas in the soup are the best ive ever had theyre not stringy or gargantuan strips of tortilla chips theyre just the perfect size so that you can eat them in one bite and so that they end up just the right amount of soggy by the time you eat your soup also worth mentioning is their guacamole salsas and mexican wedding cakes i always spend no more than 6 7 because i always tip them at least 1 and end up really full i love the owner the old man hes so friendly i want to adopt him as my abuelo im not mexican he always remembers things we talked about last time his wife is not as friendly but i presume this is because her english is not that great i should mention though that almost every time she helps me my order gets a little tweaked or takes longer than it should i think she works the later shift it is a really small space my bathroom is bigger than this place sometimes its hard to figure out whos waiting for food and whos waiting to order they have a makeshift wrap around bench outside and there are two other benches though im not sure if they belong to canasta or jamba its right next door i would hardly consider that outside seating since anything as messy as a burrito or taco shouldnt really be eaten over your lap i never think about what goes on behind the scenes in a restaurant if washing dishes in the bathroom sink is what youre worried about you probably just shouldnt eat out i can attest to the many entries about the un sanitary levels in restaurants having worked in many dining establishments before i once worked at a restaurant where we served a bagel that had fallen onto the floor to a six year old girl but the two big cons the size and sanitary issue arent these part of the charm of hole in the wall ethnic eateries anyway i had a fairly underwhelming burrito here but the price is right and theyre friendly except when ignoring you for phone orders see below i think the best way to go is to call ahead the phone never seems to stop ringing and its a little obnoxious when youre standing there and the guy behind the counter takes phone calls instead of your order this happened each time i went not that id expect white glove service while patronizing a burrito place but flat out ignoring your customers is rude rule of thumb is that if someone is standing in your restaurant you serve or at least acknowledge them over a phone order and sorry but 8 53pm is not 9pm when they close you left me hungry la canasta i wish i could give 1 5 stars two is too high but one is too low food is super bland and uninteresting the only reason why its rated so high is because it is the only taqueria in the area pretty much it destroys all competitors seriously though if your in the neighborhood and want mexican you should change your mind and get pizza because this mexican food makes me sad i live close by and i actually get in my car and drive to another taqueria i do love mexican food and that is why i give this place a couple of stars damn good burritos nice guy who runs the place pretty fast too i work at sephora on union street and go there for lunch i always get carne asada and mmmmm it is really goood and the service is great too the guy always remembers and knows me and he is always so nice recommendable especially if you dont wanna travel all the way to the mission for some authentic but nothing beats authentic mission yummmmm i went here to get lunch one afternoon when i got of class and i was expecting it would be good because of the convenient location i was wrong the food here is bad very dry bland and eating a burrito taste like your chewing on nothing i dont recommend this place and plus its usually crowded i guess the caucasian folk like this place although i am not a fan of shredded chicken somehow some way this place manages to pull it off i dont know how perhaps its all the other ingredients that mask it but it is quite a tasty taco theyre kicking out quick and delicious its the only decent mexican food ive found in the marina i love that i can order a mojado style grilled chicken burrito and watch you put the meat on the grill right then i also love that you will deliver my burritos to my apartment along with your wonderful super nachos im a little concerned by taylor es post 8 21 07 that says you wash your dishes in the bathroom sink though is that possible can a restaurant exist in sf for so many years and the inspectors never catch that lets take a look http dphwww sfdph or true an 88 rating isnt spectacular but its also not horrible nicks got an 86 for example cantasta you lose one star for possible pee hand burritos but after enjoying them for 10 years i cant break up with you just yet my hope is that your 08 inspection will show improvement all of the marina t00ls that think the food sucks here probably also think that a burrito needs rice in it that uggs are still cool and that jaeger bombs at the busstop at 11pm on a tuesday are cool and that leaving your credit card there to pick up on friday is what bros do
4315980 i often find myself wanting delicious seafood but having no specific seafood restaurant in mind
4315981 so what kind of crabs are you going to order
4315982 oh i forgot to put your order in im sorry but everything should be fine theyre really on time today and your food should be out pretty quickly
4315983 would you like to be a super hero or a cheer leader
4315984 i told that jerk that i would do something why is he bugging you
4315985 itll take a moment sorry for the food a smile nothing
4315986 yes were open please for the love of god come in and spend some money in here
4315987 and so here we are negotiating on our own with diminished leverage against a united front of media conglomerates
4315988 is this what we want for our future if this leadership stays in place the bad relations with aftra will persist and well continue to negotiate contracts from a position of division and weakness
4315989 were always appreciative of our higher level members getting involved
4315990 its just disappointing that these individuals would rather the guild accept a bad deal then hold firm on a deal that could possibly benefit middle class actors
4315991 had we taken the amptps offer we would be unfortunately stuck with issues that we probably could not revisit especially in the area of residuals for product made for new media were not satisfied with a proposal that denies performers residuals in an area that we basically know will take over as tv
4315992 i stumbled upon this place looking for a late late lunch and found it at progressive grounds cafe

4315995 what is that a lamb chop it tastes like lamb
4315996 lots of diversity two different floors lots of room to dance security was very friendly and the staff is awesome
4315997 excuse me do you know whos supposed to be serving this table
4315998 hmm you know i think it might actually be me
4315999 im sorry everything has sucked for you guys so far
4316000 sorry this was an exception and we hope to see you back again

4316084 charismatics are flocking to the sleepy town of lakeland fla to attend evangelist todd bentleys unconventional revival services
4316085 his methods are far from polished when he prayed for people in lakeland he usually began by laying his hand on their heads and then yelling bam often the people fell backward to the floor after one elderly woman fell bentley told the audience she doesnt know why she fell down the woman then laughed and said to him in the microphone because you pushed me he prayed for her three more times that night and she said she could hear better during the past three weeks people have testified of being healed from heart conditions skin rashes and back problems and many said scars disappeared many charismatics are wondering if the protracted meetings will become a phenomenon similar to what happened in rodney meetings in lakeland in 1993 at the toronto airport vineyard church in canada in 1994 and at brownsville assembly of god in pensacola in 1995
4316086 i decided to check out patricia king and todd bentley and ignorant of their third heaven guided visualizations attended a five day conference of patricia king and then two of todd bentleys conferences and began to imagine third heaven visitations guided visualization still not realizing that these are actually spirits of darkness the new age calls them spirit guides demons is what they are
4316087 i was in my living room laying on the floor listening to the teaching on how to visualize the third heaven and what to say and was getting caught up into his teaching and all of a sudden i began to shake uncontrollably and jerk and groan and no sooner had this taken place i became frozen stiff i could not move any part of my body and i knew this was a demon trying to take hold of me and so with all the effort i could muster i cried out
4316088 i spent much of the night in tears asking god to forgive me and renouncing all the hands layed on me and all the awful deception i had opened myself up to

4316169 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4316170 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst

4316173 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4316174 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4316175 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4316176 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4316177 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home

4316179 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4316180 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4316181 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4316182 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4316183 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself

4316187 the reality is americans still take their cues from high profile people

4316189 the idea is if they can do it so can we

4316194 ya tuhan kami janganlah engkau hukum kami jika kami lupa atau kami tersalah ya tuhan kami janganlah engkau bebankan kepada kami beban yang berat sebagaimana engkau bebankan kepada orang orang sebelum kami
4316195 inilah ayat ayat penamat surah yang besar ini iaitu ia besar dengan saiz pengungkapannya kerana ia merupakan surah al quran yang paling panjang juga besar dengan maudhu maudhunya yang merupakan bahagian pembicaraan yang amat besar
4316196 allah swt tidak membebankan hamba hamba nya dengan sesuatu yang tidak mampu mereka kerjakan bahkan sifat kemurahan nya memberikan kemudahan kepada mereka
4316197 inilah khabar gembira daripada allah swt setelah mereka menerima beban kewajipan daripada nya dengan rasa taat dan penuh penerimaan berkat kurnia dan kemurahan allah swt kepada mereka mereka diberikan beban yang mampu mereka kerjakan bahkan tidak sukar untuk melaksanakannya
4316198 ya tuhan kami janganlah engkau hukum kami jika kami lupa atau kami tersalah ya tuhan kami janganlah engkau bebankan kepada kami beban yang berat sebagaimana engkau bebankan kepada orang orang sebelum kami
4316199 ayat ini menggalakkan manusia melakukan perbuatan baik dan melaksanakan kewajipan kewajipan agama ini disebabkan membatasi hasil perbuatan baik terhadap pelakunya termasuk pendorong yang terkuat untuk turut bergerak melakukan kebaikan
4316200 akan tetapi sebaliknya ia mengingatkan manusia agar jangan menangguhkan kebaikan kerana kerugiannya akan menimpa diri mereka sendiri bukan kepada orang lain membatasi kerugian perbuatan buruk terhadap pelakunya termasuk cara pencegahan terkuat agar seseorang tidak melakukannya
4316201 inilah penamat surah yang besar yang terkumpul di dalam dua ayat yang menjadi intisari yang sempurna kepada bahagian bahagian mauduk yang terbesar yang wajar dijadikan sebagai penamatnya iaitu penamat yang selaras dengan mauduk mauduk surah selaras dengan suasana dan matlamat matlamatnya
4316202 akhirnya orang orang mukmin itu menutup doa mereka dengan bermohon maafkanlah kami yakni hapuskan dosa dosa kami lindungi kami yakni tutupkan aib kami dengan tidak menghukum kami akibat kesilapan dan rahmati kami dengan bermacam rahmat melebihi penghapusan dosa dan penutupan aib engkau adalah pelindung kami kerana itu menangkan kami dengan kritikan dan kekuatan fizik menghadapi orang orang kafir

4316206 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4316207 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4316208 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4316209 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4316210 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4316211 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4316212 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4316213 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4316214 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4316215 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4316216 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4316217 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4316218 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4316219 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4316220 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4316221 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted

4316224 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4316225 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4316226 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4316227 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4316228 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4316229 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4316230 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4316231 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4316232 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4316233 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4316234 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4316235 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4316236 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4316237 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4316238 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4316239 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4316240 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4316241 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4316242 benjamin franklin made it prestigious to embrace certain bourgeois virtues now its socially acceptable to undermine those virtues its considered normal to play the debt game and imagine that decisions made today will have no consequences for the future
4316243 some of the toxins were economic rising house prices gave people the impression that they could take on more risk some were cultural we entered a period of mass luxury in which people down the income scale expect to own designer goods some were moral schools and other institutions used to talk the language of sin and temptation to alert people to the seductions that could ruin their lives they no longer do
4316244 decision making is a long chain of processes most of which happen beneath the level of awareness we absorb a way of perceiving the world from parents and neighbors we mimic the behavior around us each time an avid lender struck a deal with an avid borrower it reinforced a new definition of acceptable behavior for neighbors family and friends in a community behavior sets off ripples every decision is a public contribution or a destructive act
4316245 driven by the desire to earn the respect of their fellows
4316246 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4316247 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4316248 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4316249 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4316250 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4316251 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4316252 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4316253 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4316254 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4316255 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4316256 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4316257 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4316258 who will be the next president of the united states
4316259 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4316260 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4316261 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4316262 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4316263 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
4316264 it doesnt matter which one is president there is going to be a tremendous need for lobbying
4316265 you can put in in my whole but i am not going t suck on it
4316266 you cant call me cat hope because youve taken all my hope away
4316267 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4316268 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4316269 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4316270 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4316271 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4316272 creemos que crysis warhead va a ofrecer una tremenda experiencia a un gran n mero de jugadores
4316273 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4316274 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4316275 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4316276 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4316277 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4316278 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4316279 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4316280 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4316281 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4316282 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4316283 the u s softball team played in a stadium only about 30 percent full on tuesday while the day before 10 of 18 venues did not reach 80 percent capacity
4316284 business is worse than at this time last year said a receptionist at a 22 room hotel in beijings chongwen district where rooms cost 28 a night
4316285 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4316286 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4316287 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4316288 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4316289 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4316290 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4316291 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4316292 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4316293 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4316294 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4316295 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4316296 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4316297 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4316298 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4316299 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4316300 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4316301 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4316302 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4316303 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4316304 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4316305 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4316306 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4316307 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4316308 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4316309 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4316310 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4316311 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4316312 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4316313 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4316314 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4316315 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4316316 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4316317 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4316318 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4316319 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4316320 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4316321 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4316322 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4316323 billof rights there is a mountain of evidence that bush is incompetent
4316324 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4316325 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4316326 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4316327 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4316328 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4316329 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4316330 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4316331 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4316332 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4316333 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4316334 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4316335 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4316336 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4316337 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4316338 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4316339 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4316340 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4316341 he sido una persona afortunada sigmund nada en la vida freud me ha sido f cil
4316342 this army travels around with irregulars travels around with marauders travels around with rapists travels around with arsonists robbers and with looters
4316343 my call of course is for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and for the ceasefire agreement to be honoured
4316344 and we will be working this issue throughout the coming weeks
4316345 captures an expanded spectrum of values and criteria for measuring organizational and societal success economic environmental and social
4316346 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4316347 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4316348 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4316349 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4316350 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4316351 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4316352 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4316353 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4316354 this is an important potential cure it is possible one injection could switch off the abnormal immune response
4316355 if it works it could reverse the disease and stop further episodes
4316356 not only do i need to hear gods voice but also he wants to hear mine
4316357 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4316358 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4316359 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4316360 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4316361 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4316362 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4316363 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4316364 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4316365 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4316366 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4316367 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
4316368 we have to get the country off the 700 billion a year it spends on foreign oil
4316369 its a killer and is going to cause our economy great problems
4316370 what im doing now im trying to do for the country
4316371 he asked if we could we join together and do something i told him no because global warming is on page two for me
4316372 feeling is they have more in common than the elements that might separate their proposals
4316373 as soon as you open up the marketplace you are going to see an explosion in entrepreneurial activity
4316374 theres an emerging consensus that renewables which have been derided for so long as a pop gun when you need a cannon are showing signs of being able to contribute on a much larger scale than anyone has thought
4316375 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4316376 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4316377 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4316378 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4316379 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4316380 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4316381 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4316382 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4316383 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4316384 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4316385 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4316386 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4316387 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4316388 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4316389 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4316390 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4316391 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4316392 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4316393 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4316394 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4316395 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4316396 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4316397 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4316398 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4316399 but if anyone out there thinks they can plan or plot anything against our officers we know whats going on
4316400 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their marriage the couple tied the knot in a simple low key ceremony in las vegas last week
4316401 peaches first met max two years ago maxs band chester french played at the itv itunes festival where peaches was co host
4316402 the acclaimed boston band were signed by pharrell williams to his label star trak their marriage has the support of family and friends
4316403 symbolises me being owned by him for him to have a rope around me
4316404 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
4316405 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
4316406 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
4316407 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
4316408 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4316409 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4316410 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4316411 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4316412 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4316413 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4316414 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4316415 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4316416 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4316417 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4316418 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4316419 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4316420 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4316421 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4316422 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4316423 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4316424 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4316425 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4316426 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
4316427 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4316428 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
4316429 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
4316430 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
4316431 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
4316432 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
4316433 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
4316434 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
4316435 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
4316436 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
4316437 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
4316438 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
4316439 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
4316440 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
4316441 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
4316442 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
4316443 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
4316444 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4316445 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
4316446 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
4316447 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
4316448 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
4316449 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
4316450 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
4316451 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
4316452 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
4316453 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
4316454 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
4316455 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
4316456 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
4316457 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
4316458 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4316459 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4316460 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4316461 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4316462 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4316463 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4316464 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4316465 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4316466 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4316467 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4316468 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4316469 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4316470 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4316471 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4316472 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4316473 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4316474 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4316475 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
4316476 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
4316477 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
4316478 its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
4316479 our choice of language frames how we think about others it is time to respect and value people with intellectual disabilities it is time to accept and welcome them as our friends and neighbors
4316480 minha opini o n o conta devo procurar quem me d valor
4316481 terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4316482 we have credible reports of villages being burned of shootings of killings of innocent people and civilians
4316483 we heard sirens and shooting and hurried to leave the area
4316484 outside gori there were people on the road looking for cars to take them away
4316485 a proportionate response to an unprovoked assault on it citizens
4316486 no intention of annexing or occupying any part of georgia
4316487 over the next few days on the condition that georgia refrains from military activity and keeps its forces out of the region russia will continue to take the diplomatic steps required to consolidate this temporary cessation to hostilities
4316488 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4316489 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4316490 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4316491 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4316492 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4316493 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4316494 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4316495 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4316496 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4316497 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4316498 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4316499 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4316500 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4316501 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4316502 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4316503 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4316504 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4316505 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4316506 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4316507 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4316508 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4316509 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4316510 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4316511 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4316512 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4316513 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4316514 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4316515 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4316516 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4316517 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4316518 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4316519 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4316520 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4316521 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4316522 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4316523 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4316524 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4316525 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4316526 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4316527 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4316528 who are open to doing something on the production side
4316529 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4316530 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4316531 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4316532 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4316533 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4316534 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4316535 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4316536 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4316537 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4316538 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4316539 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4316540 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4316541 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4316542 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4316543 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4316544 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4316545 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4316546 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4316547 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4316548 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4316549 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4316550 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4316551 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4316552 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4316553 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4316554 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4316555 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4316556 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4316557 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4316558 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4316559 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4316560 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4316561 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4316562 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4316563 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4316564 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4316565 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4316566 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4316567 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4316568 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4316569 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4316570 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4316571 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4316572 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4316573 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4316574 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4316575 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4316576 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4316577 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4316578 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4316579 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4316580 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4316581 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4316582 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4316583 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4316584 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4316585 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4316586 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4316587 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4316588 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4316589 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4316590 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4316591 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4316592 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4316593 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4316594 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4316595 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4316596 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4316597 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4316598 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4316599 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4316600 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4316601 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4316602 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4316603 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4316604 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4316605 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4316606 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4316607 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4316608 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4316609 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4316610 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4316611 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4316612 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4316613 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4316614 if you want to have a friend you have to be a friend
4316615 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4316616 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4316617 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4316618 this sixth generation of golf cars will completely redefine the quality and comfort level of its class over broad categories offering more customer value than ever before
4316619 we have cast the golfs core components in a precise new mold
4316620 the golf is the global icon car making so the architecture and graphic form of new model are also absolutely clear and unique
4316621 it is more accentuated more three dimensional than its predecessor with precisely defined lines and edges and with finely proportioned flared surfaces and recesses
4316622 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
4316623 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
4316624 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
4316625 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
4316626 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
4316627 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next

4316629 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation

4316632 low oil prices in the late 1990s dampened the impetus for finding new oil supplies
4316633 investment slackened just as finding new supplies was becoming more difficult and costly most of the worlds big easy to tap fields have already been discovered and largely drained

4316640 hgtv highly values its editorial relationship with afterelton and the network always forwards on every request that is made to the talent
4316641 it just seems a lot of them come in they have no motivation they dont really care and they are fine with dropping out of school
4316642 i know where i want to go in life i know a lot of people dont but ive always i want to get here and i have to do this and this to get there but i see a lot of people ok with making cs and ds because they are passing the class
4316643 i think sports a lot of time are overwhelming just balancing practices and games
4316644 where would i be if i had chosen to remain in school getting an education my parents encouraging me
4316645 find something that motivates you to go to school and do your best
4316646 because if you dont you will just drop out and become bums on the street and wont amount to much
4316647 the sound was extremely loud and i first thought another building was hit until i smelled smoke
4316648 i was sitting on my sofa watching tv when all of a sudden there was a very loud cracking sound
4316649 i grew up believing an evangelical couldnt be a democrat
4316650 when you look at the political party that has traditionally championed poverty social justice and care for the least of these its not been the republican party
4316651 we are to honor the least of these above even ourselves its very difficult to reconcile totally
4316652 i dont think any young evangelical is ignoring the traditional values issues but they are adding other issues including poverty and war and they are also looking at integrity and family
4316653 they tried to feel me out and see where i stood
4316654 if i may be so bold there was another president
4316655 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4316656 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4316657 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4316658 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4316659 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4316660 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4316661 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4316662 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4316663 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years

4316670 what weve had to go through losing our son to find out theres a financial price tag
4316671 im disappointed and disgusted to be quite frank its a very sad day from our clubs point of view this is going to have a massive effect on our league competition
4316672 disappointed with the decision as we dont believe its in the best interests of football in south australia
4316673 so they charge you plus they charge you for a late fee i knew it was bogus
4316674 i was concerned say mad that people were doing this i know probably the elderly would get hit hardest
4316675 it says youre required to do this and there is no requirement
4316676 they can do it themselves through our office the clerks office at no cost to themselves
4316677 what bothers me is there are a lot of firms out there that are pushing the envelope
4316678 the post office returned it and they didnt return it to this company they returned it to us so they themselves the post office got confused

4316705 nee eigenlijk al een paar dagen maar nu pas realiseer ik het echt
4316706 ja net bij de dokter geweest want ik wilde maar meteen een afspraak maken voor een abortus maar de dokter vond dat we daar eerst eens even goed over na moesten denken
4316707 ja maar eigenlijk is even goed nadenken mischien ook wel het beste

4316723 i would be saying to myself ive got a real chance here to play kids experiment and along the way actually lose and get a crack at a priority pick
4316724 whilst the players will be trying im not so sure the club will be keen
4316725 theres many ways to minimise a sides effectiveness its all about the spirit the preparation the intensity and the motivation as well as selections and rotations
4316726 once the games on no one deliberately tries to lose its just a matter of whether you give yourself the best chance of winning youd expect melbourne to win
4316727 im sure the recruiting boys and those in the back office will be hoping like hell they compete well but get beaten
4316728 the initial disappointment of losing would be devastating but then come trade time and draft time theyd be pretty rapt
4316729 i would have thought both coaches would be trying hard
4316730 i reckon dean would trying a little bit harder though its just a fact of where both clubs are at
4316731 whats the benefit of winning and whats the benefit of losing
4316732 of course the answer is theres more to be gained by losing than winning youd be saying we want a winning ethos but were not going to play finals footy
4316733 if we win does that help us next year the answer is no it doesnt
4316734 how do you go about it you cant come out and say were going to tank youd tell the board so they understand the situation
4316735 i think west coast showed last week they were fair dinkum
4316736 ive never believed in it you cant even think about it when youre talking about the culture of your club a coach cant get that across to his players and get away with it you just cant sell it to them
4316737 the thing is have you ever seen brewsters hair its ridiculous
4316738 i hate the way its too long and curly i hate the way it looks so we were going to tie him down and shave his head jimmys over here hiding him in his room pretending like hes not in there
4316739 this statement is to say that after so much speculation and comments the actors dolores fonzi and gael garcia bernal are indeed expecting a baby at the start of next year

4316753 we hope to have a resolution in the not too distant future i hope within the next week or so
4316754 i travel interstate 94 every single day and i love it
4316755 im sure theres been a loss of time for transit
4316756 during the peak periods you usually see the buses on the shoulder zipping by the traffic
4316757 a lot of traffic engineers among others are really looking forward to seeing what happens with our traffic pattern
4316758 im not aware of lenders offering better terms than what uheaa is offering
4316759 we encouarge students to research who theyre going to get loans from and find the best terms they can get they are going to have to pay more interest thats unfortunate
4316760 we want people to look professionally so people will feel comfortable interacting with our employees
4316761 when a police officer shows up you dont want to see a nazi tattoo on their forehead or a ring around their nose
4316762 weve come a long way since things were so judgmental
4316763 some people dont feel comfortable with interacting with people that are that way
4316764 we would rather have a full cadre of lenders but that is unlikely to happen in the near feature until congress raises the yields
4316765 now were calling on congress and the departments of treasury and education to take additional action to further stabilize the student loan program for years to come
4316766 it was not as fast as i wanted to go but that is down to a lack of hurdles races really
4316767 but i have got that one out of the way
4316768 the hurdles is always a bit nerve wracking but then you can settle in for the high jump its an okay starting point
4316769 its important to balance the need to protect wildlife with the need to use the lake for societal needs
4316770 its important to kennecott that the selenium standard is set to a scientifically defensible level

4316773 para nosotros es sencillo decir la verdad y nada m s
4316774 yo tengo mejores placeres que este tipo de diversiones para m es claro yo fui tom el micr fono yo lo dije qued grabado que ten amos la instrucci n del juez y la orden de suspender la asamblea y a n en el caso de que no fuera claro eso no quiere decir que se legitiman todas la serie de irregularidades con las que transformaron a la a c en s a porque ni hubo socios no hubo aportaciones est n capitalizando para una sociedad an nima un patrimonio que no era propiedad de los socios con certificado porque la asociaci n civil es una persona jur dica diferente y es larga la lista de ilegalidades con las que ellos se est n manejando no es nada m s si se notific o no pero eso habla de la pobreza de las bases que tienen para defender un punto jur dico vamos a ver si despu s de que se escuche la grabaci n es divertido o no
4316775 t sabes que estos testigos son manejados por la gente de vergara jorge porque los tienen amarrados a trav s de los contratos y todo lo que firmaron si a ellos les dicen no vengas yo pago la multa pues cu l es el problema
4316776 es un recurso que ellos est n utilizando para postergar el que se llegue a una sentencia no es una coincidencia ni nada al azar gente que vino la vez pasada y que se notific aqu el d a de hoy no vienen hoy se les avisar que el afi ir por ellos seguramente vendr n el d a 11 y otros dos de los que s vinieron ahora no vendr n est n haciendo como se dice en el futbol tiempo
4316777 es una posibilidad ser titular la verdad que me gustar a estoy trabajando para eso para tratar de arrancar si bien todav a falta m s de una semana para el pr ximo partido hay que ir trabajando se est trabajando bien por ah un poco m s tranquilo pero reci n sabemos lo que viene y ojal podamos estar de titular
4316778 la verdad que si uno no entra de titular o va al banco se trata de apoyar donde sea y hay que seguir d ndole confianza al equipo y eso lo hacen los triunfos ganar te motiva m s te hace confiar m s en uno mismo en el grupo y estemos donde estemos siempre vamos a y tratar de dar lo mejor y apoyar
4316779 las molestias siguen estando no s si estoy al 100 por ciento algunos dolores aparecen de vez en cuando o en alg n mal movimiento que hago empiezo a sentirlos pero estoy bien estoy en eso esperemos seguir as y seguir estando all arriba
4316780 la verdad que hac a mucho que pensamos en esto de estar arriba y no dejar escapar puntos que hoy en d a son importantes para el d a de ma ana
4316781 but at the same time most of the people that are out there are out there because they love the work and they want to be there
4316782 it is difficult not to feel a wee bit vulnerable when an armed convoy cruises by
4316783 there are military vehicle convoys that traverse the city roads on a regular basis generally traffic making way for the convoys to travel through as the convoys are often the primary target for suicide attacks etc
4316784 its high energy and high stimulation youre up close and personal with life situations that consume you and i think theres no other job like that
4316785 every day theres something else that gives you a sense of inspiration
4316786 just imagine youre in a refugee camp with 150 000 people
4316787 you get this idea i cant deal with this sometimes you have to make the decision this persons not going to eat today
4316788 you do reach a point with yourself where you really have to recognize im not behaving normally the stress is getting to me
4316789 you really go through a struggle to reintegrate yourself into your own society
4316790 en croacia ning n resultado me sorprender a la eliminatoria est abierta es evidente que all van a tener que atacar m s y que vamos a tener m s espacios nosotros en 15 d as vamos a estar un poquito m s frescos tambi n y el problema es el ambiente que podemos tener all y que ganar fuera de casa siempre es complicado
4316791 ha sido un partido dif cil para nosotros ellos han defendido muy bien con marcajes al hombre no han dejado espacios y ah se ha notado la falta de frescura nuestra esperaba m s o menos lo que vi pero aqu ya no se practica el marcaje al hombre y eso s que nos ha sorprendido
4316792 tengo que estar contento con lo que hemos conseguido aunque el deseo principal era poner en marcha un juego m s fuerte y potente del que se ha demostrado es un resultado que nos abre posibilidades
4316793 those are blackfeet faces he had no right to steal those faces
4316794 the man who works the man who does great deeds in the end dies as surely as the veriest idler who cumbers the earths surface but he leaves behind him the great fact that he has done his work well
4316795 claro que lo lamento fuimos campeones juntos y es un buen muchacho a su familia a su mam la conoc mucho y obviamente es una tristeza tremenda
4316796 es triste sin embargo es un muchacho fuerte y rogamos a dios que las cosas le salgan mejor para l porque es un muchacho fuerte de coraje de ambiciones de sue os y obviamente esperemos que no se corten en este momento
4316797 la primera meta es salvarle la vida luego pensar si volver a jugar
4316798 se les hab a comentado que las primeras 24 horas eran cruciales de vida o muerte y hasta ahorita carlos las ha aprobado satisfactoriamente aunque tambi n no podemos hablar que ya no est en riesgo de muerte hasta que no termine su proceso de coma inducido mientras tanto en este momento podemos decir que se va muy adelantado sobre las expectativas y su estado contin a estable como se los hemos mencionado anteriormente
4316799 en estos momentos se eval an todos los datos que son subjetivos por ejemplo la tensi n arterial y presi n intracraneana l gicamente la parte consciente ser posible medirla en cuanto l salga de coma
4316800 desde un principio se plante que por lo menos cuatro o cinco d as ten a que estar en un coma inducido controlado por la raz n obvia de disminuir el metabolismo del cerebro y dejar afuera las funciones vitales de esa manera el cerebro requiere menos ox geno entonces nos tenemos que esperar a ese lapso y de acuerdo a que se tenga una evoluci n satisfactoria como hasta ahora se le har este procedimiento
4316801 la primera meta es salvar la vida despu s ver si hay secuelas por parte de la enfermedad y como tercera fase si no hay secuelas o son m nimas se plantear si tienen la posibilidad de jugar o no repito que en este momento la prioridad es la vida y lo dem s es obsoleto
4316802 hablar no es lo m s importante si no apoyar a la familia de nuestro compa ero afortunadamente vi a la mam de carlitos muy tranquila pues ayer tuve la fortuna de platicar con ella y lo m s importante es que todo va por buen camino
4316803 me faltan todav a muchas fechas una responsabilidad ante la afici n hasta en mi propio equipo lograr objetivos no pienso en eso no es momento de pensar eso
4316804 esto es lo mismo cuando me dicen en un equipo te quieren firmar por dos a os por dos a os a qui n le dieron dos a os o una continuidad cuando tuvo una racha mala
4316805 yo dije a los 50 51 m ximo 52 a os iba a dirigir voy a estar cansado e iba a ser director general de lo que yo quer a hacer un equipo para formar j venes y lo tengo que decir ya era atlas
4316806 ya hab a arreglado todo tan es as que me atrev por segunda vez en mi vida la primera vez fue en el atlante a firmar por dos a os en un equipo nunca lo hab a hecho y qu pas termin el a o y me echaron
4316807 entiendo lo que haya hablado el dirigente qu bueno que tenga esa impresi n sobre el t cnico lo acepto me motiva pero no voy a esperar los resultados y voy a esperar hasta fin de a o porque no es una realidad
4316808 no se viene trabajando ac en el futbol mexicano a proyectos capaz que esta instituci n s lo haga siempre hay una primera vez en la vida pero no creo todav a en eso no creo porque no creo en la continuidad en una selecci n no creo en la continuidad en los equipos ac es resultado resultado y resultado
4316809 for some reason this team historically has been able to bounce back from tough tough losses
4316810 that could eventually become a good characteristic for a team thats fighting and heading down the stretch they dont want to let one day lead into the next especially if its a negative feeling or a negative game before that
4316811 bestowed upon him over the last 48 hours by marketing sharks and american commentators whose staple is performance enhancing superlatives
4316812 the international swimming federation fina permit such a variety of combined or medley events and relays that a wider range is available for competitors than in any other sport barring gymnastics phelps is symptomatic of this as were ian thorpe in athens kristine otto with her six medals in 1988 and spitz with his seven in 1972

4316817 this is not blackface blackface is a makeup style intended to demean us black folks with the over sized white lips and such this is a white man in make up making him look black there is nothing wrong here at least judging by the still photo im not a fan of ben stiller so im sure there is content that would offend me if i actually see this movie as far as downeys role being funny the original queation has a lot to do with how the character is played if its played like jimmy walker in fatigues then i wouldnt find it funny at all
4316818 that means working solutions for the b2b market and work on all legal constraints a company may have while distributing software
4316819 first we define the products and the business model and then we develop and release products under the appropriate license so for the codecs some of them have to be proprietary such as h 264 and windows media and others can be open sourced theora and dirac
4316820 provide a legal way for free software zealots to convert their mp3 content to free formats
4316821 fluendo has worked hard to be able to convince the patent holders to give the rights to distribute the codecs for an entire operating system legally it was one of the challenges to be able to make legal multimedia on open source solutions a reality
4316822 we have regular discussions with the community about our solutions
4316823 fluendo is a company composed by people involved in the community and we always go hand in hand with the community it is normal that we dont always agree all together the patent situation in the multimedia field is very diffciult to understand and we have to satisify as many customers as we can whether they be end users from the community or big corporations
4316824 globally fluendo is welcome and considered as an open source friendly company
4316825 the majority of the 50 people in our company are developers full involved in the open source community
4316826 the community has always recognized that fluendo as very supportive even if selling non open source software
4316827 to help linux users to understand why some plugins are missing in their distribution and then we wanted to help them download solutions in the simplest way so codeina automatically pops up when you try to read a file and dont have a good codec then you can choose the solution you want
4316828 in addition to the philosophy which is present in our daily work as a company the top management has always believed that there are ways to conduct business based upon free software
4316829 this is the major link between fluendo and the open source community we are just part of it and we want to keep on being part of it we believe that open source solutions have a great future and we want to be be one of the players in this future
4316830 gnu linux remains weak in its support for proprietary audio and video codecs
4316831 a fan of marks i nonetheless was less than impressed by this piece
4316832 he is basically going in there trying not to spend a whole lot of time inside the hotel
4316833 hes demanding money and the clerks are doing the right thing giving him whatever he wants so he can leave
4316834 weve already stepped up our patrols as far as black and white patrol units being in areas of hotels in the wee hours of the morning
4316835 that is typically the times these robberies are occurring so we have to be proactive and try to set up and catch them
4316836 the bluest pocket within the reddest state that we call home salt lake city is really creating change and possibility

4316906 one small piece of paper tacked between two doors reads 82 days to go in campaign time this means that when youre sleep deprived and crazed the race feels like its never going to end but the rest of the time it feels like youll never accomplish everything you need to the pace of a hyper fast news cycle means that the back and forth between opponents that used to take up a week can now be dispatched with in an afternoon but the most significant parts of campaigning are still tied to the moon and sun the candidate can be in only one place at a time door knocking perhaps the most valuable way to mobilize voters cannot be done via e mail blast these physical limitations mean that as the campaigns head for their conventions the calendar in fact is much tighter than the two and a half months remaining might make it seem

4316912 completely mad military directives that have no chance of being fulfilled are usually the sign of a delusional commander in a desperate and hopeless armed conflict hitler issuing orders for non existent long ago destroyed armies to attack during his last days in the bunker or stalin demanding that overrun and demolished armies counterattack against the wehrmacht invasion in june 1941 are classic examples what should one make of the announcement from one of her chief admirals vladimir vystosky on the july 27 navy day holiday that the russian navy would add six carriers to its fleet along with all of the necessary support ships that form a carrier battle group
4316913 doors kicked in people killed dogs shot phone lines tapped curfews imposed theyre all examples of official overreaching at that unpleasant intersection of private activity and state disapproval for some people the implication of a lot of coverage of such abuses is that a little more scrutiny improved oversight and the right people in charge will make law enforcement a much less perilous much more respectful enterprise which the people need not fear but what if thats not the case what if in many circumstances weve handed police and regulators and enforcers of many stripes missions that are impossible to fulfill it may be that weve assigned law enforcers goals so frustratingly elusive that even angels could not resist the temptation to escalate tactics to insane extremes trampling liberty and decency along the way
4316914 i mentioned before how the feds have committed robbery in a way even more blatant than usual in their seizure that s their euphemism for theft of lots of gold and silver from the people at norfed for those who don t know the liberty dollar is a medium of exchange that is intended to compete with the federal reserve s fiat currency what most people call dollars unlike the counterfeit rags the fed cranks out by the zillions the liberty dollar is entirely precious metals based they make silver and gold coins as well as certificates represented by actual gold and silver in their vaults

4316916 in october 1985 i think it was professor james buchanan now at george mason universitys department of economics received the nobel prize in his discipline for his pioneering work in collaboration with professor gordon tullock in what came to be called public choice theory the gist of this theory is that those who work in government often referred to in the honorific terms as doing public service are contrary to widespread impression just as much motivated by personal or self interest as are people in the market place in other words politicians and bureaucrats pursue their own agendas not those of the public just as people in business do and from this a number of interesting insights follow about the nature of government policy

4316950 stephanopoulos said the crisis in georgia is helping mccain who has been somewhat prescient in his response
4316951 a wikipedia editor emailed political wire to point out some similarities between sen john mccains speech today on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia article on the country georgia given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia
4316952 john mccains chief foreign policy adviser and his business partner lobbied the senator or his staff on 49 occasions in a 3 1 2 year span while being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the government of the former soviet republic of georgia

4316963 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4316964 allowing courts to review the question of immunity is meaningless when the same legislation essentially requires the court to grant immunity and under this bill the government can still sweep up and keep the international communications of innocent americans in the u s with no connection to suspected terrorists with very few safeguards to protect against abuse of this power

4316990 the dod the nations biggest polluter is now cleaning up 29 500 currently or formerly contaminated sites in every state and territory california alone has 3 912 contaminated sites on 441 current and former dod installations many of dods facilities have already contaminated groundwater sources of drinking water the cost to clean up toxic munitions contamination and unexploded ordnance at active and former military installations around the country may reach 200 billion
4316991 the defense department is refusing to comply with orders or sign contracts to clean up 11 hazardous waste sites including one in hawaii and has asked the white house and justice department to intervene on its behalf
4316992 large numbers of corroding depleted uranium penetrators embedded in the ground might pose a long term threat if the uranium leaches into water supplies
4316993 long term environmental sampling particularly of water and milk is required and provides a cost effective method of monitoring sensitive components of the environment and of providing information about uranium levels to concerned local populations monitoring may need to be enhanced in some areas by site specific risk assessment if the situation warrants further consideration
4316994 offer strong evidence of the correlation between low level radiation exposure and result ing health damages
4316995 a shift of leukemia incidence rates towards younger children during the recent years
4316996 in aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du
4316997 the chemical risks of breathing in uranium dust are so low that it wont cause any long term health risks
4316998 radioactive material and waste will not be locally disposed of through burial submersion incineration destruction in place or abandonment without approval from overall commander
4316999 if local disposal is approved the responsible commander must document the general nature of the disposed material and the exact location of the disposal
4317000 the fire and explosions damaged or destroyed 102 vehicles including four m1a1 tanks and numerous other combat vehicles more than two dozen buildings sustained damage as well among the estimated almost 15 million in damaged or destroyed ammunition were 660 m829 120mm du sabot rounds
4317001 personnel packing the drums with du penetrators wore surgeons caps safety glasses half face protective masks coveralls butyl rubber aprons rubber surgeons gloves with cotton inserts and rubber booties over their normal work boots a total of eight drums were filled with about 250 du penetrators
4317002 under the circumstances the army had no legal obligation to clean up the particulate material
4317003 the soil is not regulated as radioactive material by the us department of transportation
4317004 the army is responsible for characterizing the material for the purposes of complying with transportation and disposal requirements the epa does not have a specific standard related to depleted uranium for the purposes of disposal depleted uranium is considered a low level radioactive waste and is subject to u s nuclear regulatory commission regulations
4317005 the sand with small amounts of depleted uranium being sent to the u s ecology idaho facility for disposal contains exempt concentrations of uranium less than 0 5 percent weight if the concentrations were greater than this we would have oversight
4317006 during my entire tour one could say that i was in the loop in the know about operations
4317007 my notes from all of the meetings we had and we had meetings twice a day every day and many times having a meeting or two in between i can still not find one mention of potential health hazards from depleted uranium or the possible contamination of any area at camp doha
4317008 i have what they call ibs irritable bowel syndrome but theyve not been able to treat it with any success it creates constant bad bad cramping in the lower abdomen severe fatigue bad joint pain all of the norms rolled up into the gulf war illness tag
4317009 as for what i believe is the cause of my declining health
4317010 there were three constants when i arrived a doha there were the burning oil well fires there was a constant presence of insects pesticides and then there was the du ive always believed that there is more to the du than the us government and dod would like us to believe
4317011 young childrens exposure to depleted uranium must be monitored and preventive measures taken and heavily affected impact zones for depleted uranium munitions should be cordoned off and cleaned up
4317012 doctors in afghanistan say rates of some health problems affecting children have doubled in the last two years some scientists say the rise is linked to use of weapons containing depleted uranium du by the u s led coalition that invaded the country in 2001 a canadian research group found very high levels of uranium in afghans during tests just after the invasion a u s forces spokesman denied its weapons were affecting the health of afghans or the countrys environment
4317013 ever since its use by the allied forces in the first war against iraq there have been serious concerns about the radiological and chemical toxicity of the fine uranium particles produced when such weapons impact on hard targets concerns have also been expressed about the contamination of soil and groundwater by expended rounds that have missed their targets and their implications for civilian populations despite the fact that scientific research has so far been unable to find conclusive evidence of harm there are numerous testimonies as to the harmful and often deadly effects on both military personnel and civilians the last few years have seen great advances in terms of understanding the environmental and health hazards posed by depleted uranium and whereas it is high time that this was reflected in international military standards as they develop the use of depleted uranium in warfare runs counter to the basic rules and principles enshrined in written and customary international humanitarian and environmental law
4317014 there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to link du with the ill health of either gulf or balkans veterans or people living in these regions many independent reports have been produced and researchers continue to consider the battlefield effects of using du munitions these reports include work by the royal society the european commission the united nations environment programme unep and the world health organization who none of these organizations has found a connection between du exposure and illness and none has found widespread du contamination sufficient to impact the health of the general population or deployed personnel
4317015 to undertake every measure possible to ensure that depleted uranium weapons of mass destruction are banned forever
4317016 belgium has banned the use of uranium in all conventional weapon systems however at least 18 countries including the u s use depleted uranium in their arsenals they are considered weapons of mass destruction under international law according to a canada u s agreement canadian uranium exports may only be used for peaceful purposes

4317072 it really depends on whats going on with the person and whether or not theyre having severe symptoms
4317073 if theyre not showing severe symptoms we may just start them with natural items people will come in on the medications and well add the nutritional supplements in and sometimes theyll get off the acid blockers altogether
4317074 you would think it wouldnt because its very acidic on its own but lots of people respond to it really well i think it may have something to do with the fact that it helps with digestion and a lot of acid reflux symptoms stem from not digesting food well a lot of times when other things havent worked people find apple cider vinegar does and it can be taken indefinitely

4317080 that means working solutions for the b2b market and work on all legal constraints a company may have while distributing software
4317081 first we define the products and the business model and then we develop and release products under the appropriate license so for the codecs some of them have to be proprietary such as h 264 and windows media and others can be open sourced theora and dirac
4317082 provide a legal way for free software zealots to convert their mp3 content to free formats
4317083 fluendo has worked hard to be able to convince the patent holders to give the rights to distribute the codecs for an entire operating system legally it was one of the challenges to be able to make legal multimedia on open source solutions a reality
4317084 we have regular discussions with the community about our solutions
4317085 fluendo is a company composed by people involved in the community and we always go hand in hand with the community it is normal that we dont always agree all together the patent situation in the multimedia field is very diffciult to understand and we have to satisify as many customers as we can whether they be end users from the community or big corporations
4317086 globally fluendo is welcome and considered as an open source friendly company
4317087 the majority of the 50 people in our company are developers full involved in the open source community
4317088 the community has always recognized that fluendo as very supportive even if selling non open source software
4317089 to help linux users to understand why some plugins are missing in their distribution and then we wanted to help them download solutions in the simplest way so codeina automatically pops up when you try to read a file and dont have a good codec then you can choose the solution you want
4317090 in addition to the philosophy which is present in our daily work as a company the top management has always believed that there are ways to conduct business based upon free software
4317091 this is the major link between fluendo and the open source community we are just part of it and we want to keep on being part of it we believe that open source solutions have a great future and we want to be be one of the players in this future
4317092 gnu linux remains weak in its support for proprietary audio and video codecs

4317121 one of the biggest mysteries about john mccain the man who claims to be the enemy of powerful lobbyists and special interests is why he has surrounded himself with lobbyists and former lobbyists on his campaign team
4317122 it should not have happened what was private talk became public controversy and i am embarrassed by that there is no virtue in that kind of talk and it should always be discouraged my appeal even then was that responsibility is a significant message but our needs require real government intervention and private sector incentives to address the issues of unemployment building affordable housing and making education more affordable which really was my point it was a very painful period for me to have gone through that the good news is that its behind us now
4317123 the obama campaign is the first to use a long form infomercial during the 2008 presidential campaign
4317124 if you hadnt noticed that may have been because the nearly 30 minute program aired at 1 30 a m aug 10 on ion television
4317125 the mostly biographical 28 minute 30 second program included scenes of the illinois senators keynote speech to the 2004 democratic national convention as well as scenes from other campaign appearances along with background about mr obama and frequent call in numbers
4317126 im just passing on the latest im hearing that sen joe biden is moving up on the list of potential running mates for presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obama while obamas heart may go towards virginia gov tim kaine his head takes him to a more experienced pick a sen evan bayh or biden chairman of the senate foreign relations committee
4317127 john edwards didnt lose it for hillary clinton believe it or not barack obama won it
4317128 the probability that the difference between the two candidates is greater than zero in other words that one candidate is genuinely ahead of the other
4317129 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
4317130 within the past week clinton advisers informed the obama team that many of clintons staunchest supporters felt strongly that something had to be done and that clinton had concluded that in part for the sake of unity their wishes ought to be respected they heard back immediately the obama campaign had always been open to having her name placed in nomination alongside his
4317131 the greek tragedy aspect of this election could turn out to be george bush defeats john mccain twice
4317132 other states will see serious competition including florida pennsylvania nevada new hampshire missouri and wisconsin but colorado virginia michigan and ohio are likely to be the center of the action to win mr obama needs to pick up 18 electoral votes more than john kerry received meaning mr obama must carry colorado or virginia and add another small state to his column if mr mccain carries michigan as well as ohio it would make mr obamas electoral college math very difficult
4317133 i naively believed that i knew edwards as well as i understood anyone in the political center ring yet i never saw this sex scandal coming partly because i accepted the mythology that surrounded the edwards marriage and partly because i assumed that any hint of a wandering eye would have come out during the 2004 campaign but then rielle hunter and the national enquirer brought us all into the real world

4317219 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
4317220 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
4317221 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
4317222 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age

4317450 we face a situation of economic stagnation and a steep slowdown
4317451 the government is working to make sure that the economy recovers as soon as possible
4317452 if a tourist arrives and says he wants a parasol for 10 days we look at him in amazement and build a statue in his honor
4317453 what worries us most is the phenomenon of hit and run tourists
4317454 spend less eat less in the restaurants watch their shopping in the camp shop and at the cafe and on the beach they are just buying drinks and ice creams for the children rather than meals
4317455 to show that my place is not just for the rich weve decided to have a special tourist menu for 200 euros
4317456 the passport situation has just been resolved they have their passports now they will be leaving for south africa on the 6 p m 1600 gmt flight there was no explanation
4317457 she will be taking a certain number of documents that will make it possible to consolidate the ceasefire
4317458 the obama nation leftist politics and the illinois senator is a dangerous radical candidate for president the book is a compilation of all the innuendo and false rumors against obama that he was raised a muslim attended a radical black rage
4317459 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4317460 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4317461 if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4317462 im putting this question forward im putting the evidence forward voters can make up their own minds
4317463 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4317464 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4317465 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4317466 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4317467 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4317468 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i only voted for democrats from dog catcher to president and everything in between
4317469 i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4317470 they ought to put him on trial and shoot him
4317471 i saw her at the tour of spain and asked myself how can anyone climb so fast
4317472 that is not healthy it is not normal there has to be something
4317473 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
4317474 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen
4317475 we will appeal with the moscow appelate court within 10 days
4317476 we believe this is clearly a further example of administrative activity orchestrated by the other shareholders of bp
4317477 brad got a shot and i believe wont try and throw again for five days
4317478 he had an mri i have no idea when he will be able to come back weve been trying to get this thing well hes had some rest hes still got some shoulder strength its something thats been nagging him its more frustrating for him than anybody else
4317479 for some youth they start off with prescription drug abuse and its not a strong enough opiate and then they go to heroin
4317480 there hasnt been a huge change in the drug scene
4317481 were still having a problem with people going to their medicine cabinets and abusing the drugs that are there
4317482 clients at a younger age as young as high school students are getting involved with prescription opioids and then they move up to oxycontin but it becomes cost prohibitive and they move to heroin because its cheaper
4317483 even their parents were raised to think that anything can be fixed with a pill
4317484 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4317485 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4317486 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4317487 only now theyre beginning to show some pictures of the destruction so this looks to me like it was a well prepared project and with any outcome they wanted to put the blame on russia
4317488 this is the man mr gorbachev who helped to you know bring down kgb kingdom and he is the one who is you know justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country
4317489 shame on him shame on you mr gorbachev for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union
4317490 there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u s and russia interests and the interests of other countries and the interests of stability particularly in the hotspots in different continents
4317491 the response required the movement of additional forces into south ossetia because tskhinvali was attacked by a powerful force
4317492 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4317493 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4317494 its a perfect market for the first time home buyer
4317495 the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state
4317496 it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority
4317497 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4317498 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4317499 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4317500 this defining moment in our history and bring the party together
4317501 she is going to get her moment she really earned this
4317502 obama showed that he is a leader who unites the democratic party
4317503 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4317504 shes going to be encouraging her supporters to vote for obama

4317511 we have discovered that sperm behave differently when they encounter this fluid
4317512 for example sperm swim quicker live longer and even the swimming pattern is altered
4317513 this fluid may have a dramatic effect on sperm function as many sperm race against each other in aim to get to the egg first to fertilise the egg
4317514 we were startled to find that female salmon are also able to exert this kind of influence
4317515 we found that the speed of a males sperm varied significantly according to which females ovarian fluid it was swimming in
4317516 it makes sense that when you only have one opportunity to reproduce in your life you want to make sure you get it right
4317517 for the males the race does not always go to the naturally fastest runner as the conditions on the racecourse differ
4317518 whatever it is in this ovarian fluid that is enhancing or retarding sperm function may have a similar effect on sperm in other species

4317529 marie lets suppose that two firement go into a forest to put out a small fire afterward when they emerge and go over to a stream the face of one is all smeared with black while the other mans face is completely clean my question is this which of the two will wash his face
4317530 thats a silly question the one with the dirty face of course
4317531 no the one with the dirty face will look at the other man and assume that he looks like him and vice versa the man with the clean face will see his colleague covered in grime and say to himself i must be dirty too id better have a wash
4317532 im saying that during the time i spent in the hospital i came to realize that i was always looking for myself in the women i loved i looked at their lovely clean faces and saw myself reflected in them they on the other hand looked at me and saw the dirt on my face and however intelligent or self confident they were they ended up seeing themselves reflected in me and thinking that they were worse than they were please dont let that happen to you

4317543 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4317544 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4317545 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4317546 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4317547 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4317551 they called me up on the phone real quick and let us know there was a sex offender that lives around here when you learned of that what was your reaction my jaw hit the floor because there was no notification nobody knew until you found out on the computer
4317552 i was nervous that he was in the area my daughters are right there on warwood avenue at that school every day and i know hes close by i could be at this playground and cant even stand on the basketball court because im nervous he could slip in at any time
4317553 with a sex offender being here hes always walking up and down the street
4317554 he can get in there and take a person a little child that cant defend theirselves or whatever and hes not really that far away from the school
4317555 being a person whos had plastic surgery i think its personal choice a lot of people make me laugh about the plastic surgery situation because i hate to say it but most african american females in entertainment have had some type of plastic surgery

4317896 many americans have every right to feel bitter when they can see how washington and the stolen government cares for itself above them but these not quite well said words of barack obama were spun in circles like a spiders web to catch their prey

4317904 how does the ascld lab explain that before the oscd forensics lab can spend 0 002857143 ascld lab accreditation invoice of the total ocsd department yearly budget it had to go through a procurement process ultimately authorized by the sheriffs department
4317905 in order to respond to a simple question to the forensics lab one has to go through the freedom of information act then the information must be approved by the sheriffs public affairs and the support services division
4317906 what challenges or opportunities for the ascld labs accreditation of the ocsd were created by dr dean gia1amas previous association with the ascld lab
4317907 a bunch of us used to hang out in this little storefront on the lower east side that yknow we called it a gallery but it wasnt really a gallery it was more of like a party spot
4317908 it was really just a bunch of kids a bunch of dumb bored kids
4317909 i think nerds are the dispossessed who inherit the creative earth if youre not dispossessed why make art
4317910 i got subcultural when i was in the seventh grade
4317911 invented the myth perpetuated the myth encouraged us to be the myth
4317912 it says i have 1 notification when i go to my inbox i have no messages am i missing something are there other places to have notifications thanks
4317913 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
4317914 at the direction of john stodder there were occasions when i believe i may have written up some of those bills it was largely in ignorance of what i was doing
4317915 i came to my own determination that it was fraudulent and that it was wrong and that i didnt want to be a part of it
4317916 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4317917 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
4317918 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
4317919 im just asking them to sit and watch because youre going to eat your words
4317920 are you kidding me hes the creator of the goddamn universe
4317921 the response required the movement of additional forces into south ossetia because tskhinvali was attacked by a powerful force
4317922 this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town against a sleeping people this was a barbaric assault
4317923 we all know milan cannot afford to be absent from the games in the league so far in advance
4317924 it is right that this team fight until the end for the title
4317925 he jose mourinho is provocative but he does so intelligently
4317926 in my opinion he does this to create tension among others but inside in the dressing room he gives the impression he has everything under control
4317927 jurgen at this time is thinking about many things all for the good of the team but now you have to do things seriously with the start of the bundesliga and champions league
4317928 it is essential they bayern munich get victories if not then every effort should be made even if weve lost
4317929 i think wtas value has grown significantly in many households and i think it would be a benefit to us to allow the community to weigh in
4317930 i think the question is for the public is this increase in service worth it
4317931 it seems that wta is a tremendous value out there
4317932 one hour after they drank red bull their blood systems were no longer normal they were abnormal like we would expect in a patient with cardiovascular disease
4317933 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range
4317934 its obviously a male we looked at a very very large primate male it doesnt fit into any of the taxonomic groups i can think of
4317935 unbelievable im still shaking ive never seen anything like this before
4317936 im just tired of all the stalkers so i had my brother dr van buren come down im just glad you all had something to do on the weekend
4317937 its smelling to high heaven like a hoax they can claim to have dna but its not going to be possible for them to prove through dna analysis that they have bigfoot because theres no specimen in a jar that says this is bigfoot to match it to
4317938 and the video itll be whats known in the bigfoot research community as a blobsquatch an indeterminate dark blob that may or may not be a man a bear a bigfoot an elf a dragon who knows
4317939 ive had interactions with tom biscardi a well known bigfoot hunter who is holding the press conference in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4317940 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4317941 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis

4317944 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4317945 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem

4317976 i handle these situations a lot and im fairly jaded about it but when i got the call and they said the baby made it i was very excited
4317977 the bottom line is its a difficult proof level to say someone gave money intending it to be used in a terrorist attack in the united states as opposed to merely giving it to anti american groups and foreseeing it
4317978 ultimately al qaeda couldnt have done the attacks if they didnt have the resources to train and equip the 19 terrorists
4317979 even if the four princes were reckless in monitoring how their donations were spent or could and did foresee that recipients of their donations would attack targets in the united states that would be insufficient
4317980 it certainly is a reduction in a rate of growth that they were expecting as a percentage of their total revenue its relatively small
4317981 we have a much healthier hospital and health care industry
4317982 i think the commissioner has learned very quickly how to do the old hudson river two step

4318032 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4318033 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4318034 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4318035 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4318036 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4318037 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4318038 trabajo de la oea en pos del fortalecimiento de la democracia en el hemisferio
4318039 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4318040 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4318041 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4318042 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4318043 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4318044 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4318045 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4318046 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4318047 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4318048 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4318049 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4318050 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4318051 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4318052 location based mobile social networking revenues will reach 3 3 billion by 2013
4318053 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4318054 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4318055 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4318056 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4318057 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4318058 do you think she looks more like princess diana or the queen
4318059 so what do you do to keep your mind active
4318060 i can focus on rowing or anticipate the next tea break and then theres audio tapes
4318061 there were more doubts and more to think and worry about
4318062 many people think its an island of plastic trash out here but its worse
4318063 if it were an island it could be mined the reality is that its a thin soup with millions of tons of plastic the size of peas and smaller distributed around the world theres no techno fix only a cultural one
4318064 no doubt youre the coolest guys ive met in the last three months thanks for a great dinner bon voyage roz
4318065 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4318066 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4318067 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4318068 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4318069 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4318070 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4318071 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4318072 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4318073 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4318074 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4318075 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4318076 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4318077 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4318078 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4318079 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4318080 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4318081 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4318082 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4318083 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4318084 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4318085 by sharing knowledge of online games as entertainment media we hope to inspire the next generation game companies to think differently and grow the overall market worldwide
4318086 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4318087 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4318088 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4318089 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4318090 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4318091 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4318092 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4318093 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4318094 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4318095 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4318096 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4318097 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4318098 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4318099 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4318100 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4318101 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4318102 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4318103 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4318104 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4318114 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4318116 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4318117 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4318118 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4318121 jika pembatasan dilakukan setelah impor menjadi 140 persen para petani di negara berkembang sudah keburu terpuruk
4318122 mengapa ada draf kesepakatan yang muncul tanpa diketahui dan tanpa proses yang melibatkan negara berkembang
4318123 during my first town hall meeting on the schering plough campus i had been ceo all of three days i asked the question that was on everybodys mind will we bring in some new people i answered that yes we would as we saw needs for specific skills and competencies to help make our company the best i emphasized however that we would do it very carefully and with great respect for the people we currently had in the company
4318124 less than a month later i disclosed some of the specifics of the changes to our corporate structure they were not small changes they were huge and it was clear they would result in the loss of some jobs but because of my earlier candor colleagues were now prepared for accepting and even anticipating change
4318125 a good leader cant get too far ahead of his followers
4318126 too many leaders are like bad travel agents they send people places they have never been instead they should be more like tour guides taking people places they have gone and sharing the wisdom of their own experiences
4318127 i believe followers have the same attitude toward their leaders they want to see their leaders in action doing their best showing the way and setting the example
4318128 im here with my girlfriends theyre still on the dance floor

4318133 if you have managed people what are your ideas on force ranking them by the performance is it a good thing
4318134 this is frequently done when companies want to make difficult decisions such as whom to lay off its one way to identify the extremes of performance for employees in the middle there are too many factors and the company requirements are not always clearcut to do a meaningful and fair ranking
4318135 i have used the approach for a number of years and find it to be effective so long as it is used with objective performance measures and they reported to the incumbent frequently for example field sales would receive sales reports weekly make sure everyone knows the rules and give feedback along the way when communicating about ranking talk in terms of measures of effectiveness retain some flexibility the system will fail to meet your objective if the incumbents in the positions being ranked dont believe it is a fair ranking always have more than one person participate in the ranking process
4318136 at times of reorganization or restructuring when a dramatic swing in results or corporate culture is required force ranking based on performance can be a useful tool im not personally in favour of it being a sustained methodology when the low performers or climate polluters have been removed from a team and a synergy has been established i personally believe more in development and motivational techniques a positive energetic working environment is ultimately much more rewarding and fruitful
4318137 i have been involved in using force ranking and found it has its positive and negative benefits
4318138 gods work done in gods way will never lack gods supply
4318139 if i had 1 000 lives id give them all for china
4318140 god uses men who are weak and feeble enough to lean on him
4318141 we are debtors to every man to give him the gospel in the same measure in which we have received it
4318142 if a commission by an earthly king is considered a honor how can a commission by a heavenly king be considered a sacrifice
4318143 we talk of the second coming half the world has never heard of the first
4318144 this generation of christians is responsible for this generation of souls on the earth
4318145 if god calls you to be a missionary dont stoop to be a king
4318146 some wish to live within the sound of a chapel bell there are individuals ripe to receive the lord in the most resistant and hostile situations we must take the gospel to them
4318147 i wasnt gods first choice for what ive done for china i dont know who it was it must have been a man a well educated man
4318148 here is a test to find whether your mission on earth is finished if you are alive it isnt
4318149 prayer needs no passport visa or work permit there is no such thing as a closed country as far as prayer is concerned much of the history of missions could be written in terms of god moving in response to persistent prayer
4318150 the prospects are as bright as the promises of god
4318151 jehovah witnesses dont believe in hell and neither do most christians
4318152 a tiny group of believers who have the gospel keep mumbling it over and over to themselves meanwhile millions who have never heard it once fall into the flames of eternal hell without ever hearing the salvation story
4318153 i feel now that arabia could easily be evangelized within the next thirty years if it were not for the wicked selfishness of christians
4318154 i will lay my bones by the ganges that india might know there is one who cares
4318155 it will not do to say that you have no special call to go to china with these facts before you and with the command of the lord jesus to go and preach the gospel to every creature you need rather to ascertain whether you have a special call to stay at home
4318156 if sinners be damned at least let them leap to hell over our bodies and if they perish let them perish with our arms about their knees imploring them to stay if hell must be filled at least let it be filled in the teeth of our exertions and let not one go there unwarned and unprayed for
4318157 i would like to buy 3 worth of god please not enough to explode my sould or disturb my sleep but just enough to equal a cup of warm milk or snooze in the sunshine i dont want enough of him to make me love a black man or pick beets with a migrant i want ecstasy not a transformation i want the warmth of the womb not a new birth i want about a pound of the eternal in a paper sack id like to buy 3 worth of god please how much do you want
4318158 i am convinced that when we stand before god we will discover that every soul ever brought to a knowledge of christ was in some way related to intercessory prayer
4318159 god is a missionary god the bible is a missionary book the gospel is a missionary message the church is a missionary institution and when the church ceases to be missionary minded it has denied its faith and betrayed its trust
4318160 look to the heathen without christ and you will find an altar and may god help you to be a sacrifice
4318161 there is no better way to measure the self centeredness in the church than the lip service that we give to the heart of god concerning those who are living in total darkness
4318162 the opposite of love is not hate it is indifference

4318189 the position of the department of homeland security is that medical care constitutes material support
4318190 doctors are expected to provide treatment without making judgments about who the patient is
4318191 thats what their oath is and its been recognized by international law the government shouldnt be on the side of punishing people for doing their duties
4318192 if i didnt help them otherwise they could die of their wounds
4318193 from complications from their wounds some of them bleed to death they dont have access to public hospitals because of security reasons they died of minor injuries
4318194 i cant judge them by their political stance because im a doctor im a professional doctor and im not a political
4318195 i have to help them this is my duty even if there is somebody from the side of the government who was in need of my help i would do it without looking at what he was doing
4318196 i was hearing crying voices i was hearing people screaming
4318197 that was the worst for me i was happy when they take me out for torture
4318198 the government would like to deny him asylum for the simple act of trying to allay the suffering of an injured human being and i think thats remarkable in and of itself
4318199 the governments position is that duress and threat of imminent execution is no defense its insane
4318200 every time i meet with the women of panjshir i leave with two very distinct feelings
4318201 first i appreciate the freedoms i have as an american second it makes me feel very positive about the way women feel empowered to help with their families and communities
4318202 these women all have great ideas about what can be done to make their villages better
4318203 for instance they talk about the need for power drinking water and schools
4318204 the women talk about wanting to learn skills that will help generate money for their families and villages
4318205 women want to work and little by little theyre being able to
4318206 our sole goal is to safely and rapidly deliver humanitarian aid to georgia to alleviate human suffering and save lives

4318238 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4318239 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4318240 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4318241 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4318242 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4318252 blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb 43 and why is this granted me that the mother of my lord should come to me 44 for behold when the voice of your greeting came to my ears the babe in my womb leaped for joy 45 and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the lord
4318253 my soul magnifies the lord 47 and my spirit rejoices in god my savior 48 for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold henceforth all generations will call me blessed 49 for he who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is his name 50 and his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation 51 he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts 52 he has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of low degree 53 he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent empty away 54 he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy 55 as he spoke to our fathers to abraham and to his posterity for ever
4318254 joyfully keep joseph and mary company and you will hear the traditions of the house of david we walk in haste towards the mountains to a town of the tribe of judah luke 1 39
4318255 we arrive it is the house where john the baptist is to be born elizabeth gratefully hails the mother of her redeemer blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb why should i be honored with a visit from the mother of my lord luke 1 42 43
4318256 if we have this filial contact with mary we wont be able to think just about ourselves and our problems selfish personal problems will find no place in our mind
4318257 to show that she should be honored by angels and by men and why she should indeed be revered above all other women
4318258 rejoicing with mary at her dignity as mother of god and praising the lord thanking him for having given us jesus christ through mary
4318259 see how new and how wonderful this mystery is he has not yet left the womb but he speaks by leaping he is not yet allowed to cry out but he makes himself heard by his actions he has not yet seen the light but he points out the sun he has not yet been born and he is keen to act as precursor the lord is present so he cannot contain himself or wait for nature to run its course he wants to break out of the prison of his mothers womb and he makes sure he witnesses to the fact that the savior is about to come
4318260 this union of the mother with the son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of christs virginal conception up to his death first when mary arising in haste to go to visit elizabeth is greeted by her as blessed because of her belief in the promise of salvation and the precursor leaps with joy in the womb of his mother the blessed virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith and faithfully persevered in her union with her son unto the cross where she stood cf john 19 25 in keeping with the divine plan enduring with her only begotten son the intensity of his suffering associating herself with his sacrifice in her mothers heart and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this victim which was born of her
4318261 our prayer can accompany and imitate this prayer of mary like her we feel the desire to sing to acclaim the wonders of god so that all mankind and all creation may share our joy
4318262 the first fruits of the holy spirit are peace and joy and the blessed virgin had received within herself all the grace of the holy spirit
4318263 virgin mother of god he whom the heavens cannot contain on becoming man enclosed himself within your womb
4318264 it was fitting then that just as death entered the world through the pride of our first parents the entry of life should be manifested by the humility of mary
4318265 from the earliest times the blessed virgin is honored under the title of mother of god under whose protection the faithful take refuge together in prayer in all their perils and needs
4318266 and his mercy is on those who fear him from generation to generation
4318267 at the very moment of the incarnation these words open up a new perspective of salvation history
4318268 when pride takes hold of a soul it is no surprise to find it bringing along with it a whole string of other vices greed self indulgence envy injustice
4318269 we should beg god not to let us fall into this temptation pride is the worst sin of all and the most ridiculous pride is unpleasant even from a human point of view the person who rates himself better than everyone and everything is constantly studying himself and looking down on other people who in turn react by ridiculing his foolish vanity
4318270 the lord your god bore you as a man bears his son in all the way that you went
4318271 god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
4318272 itll depend on where she is now how important the case is how much it would cost the taxpayers and whether witnesses are still around

4318300 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4318301 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4318302 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4318303 i would consider that to be bluster from the foreign minister of russia
4318304 because of the nature of the business theres a lot of travel involved odd hours thereve been times we all live under the same roof but we havent seen each other for days on end
4318305 its wonderful to get an opportunity to spend six weeks on the road with the family i dont think weve spent this amount of time and this quality of time for over 10 years together
4318306 when we see the live audience hear their roar hear their appreciation that is the incentive
4318307 every time we keep feeling like oh my god last nights show was fabulous it has been very very overwhelming
4318308 i think it speaks wonderfully and gloriously for the indian film industry
4318309 its very heartening to know that indian films are viewed in all these places and its wonderful to know that you reach out to so many people and they appreciate your work
4318310 at this point it is hard to see why anyone would stick their neck out for gen musharraf
4318311 i am celebrating our independence which i feel is near
4318312 who would have ever thought it would be zardari accusing someone else of embezzlement
4318313 politics on the other hand is not something people usually enjoy so what do you do you make yourself more visible to the public in a more entertaining way
4318314 its nice to see a democrat blow something besides the election
4318315 we feel that these people in hollywood have made a fortune having a good time
4318316 people like to see them take a fall and get their comeuppance
4318317 neither mccain nor obama want to be seen as celebrities yet both of them are so what we have here is both hypocrisy and absurdity
4318318 mccain needs to paint obama as a harvard elite egghead celebrity
4318319 now he feels like hes ringing the pinball machine the last thing obama needs is to be seen in a photograph with a celebrity
4318320 our year to date sales growth of 99 for the ps3 reaffirms that consumers are indeed embracing ps3 as their entertainment hub of choice with its feature rich offerings like blu ray and our recently announced video delivery service
4318321 some fundamental factors lead us to believe consumer inflation is at or near its peak
4318322 we are optimistic the relief in energy prices since mid july will mean the large monthly increases in the consumer price index energy which occurred in four of the last five months will cease furthermore we anticipate aggressive discounting from retailers as consumer activity wanes throughout the second half
4318323 the market believes weak growth and weakened demand will arrest inflation
4318324 thats why treasuries survived that 0 3 increase in core cpi
4318325 my punishment is nothing compared to the pain and suffering ive brought you
4318326 im not strong enough to ask for forgiveness i ask the lord to forgive ive done horrible things that brought sorrow and pain to these wonderful people
4318327 rodriguez was one of the more violent ones during the escape
4318328 he would put these shanks in peoples ears while they were being tied up making threats
4318329 so he was right in front of him and firing directly at him
4318330 the memory of officer aubrey hawkins his dedication to duty and family are cherished by the irving police department and others that knew aubrey
4318331 our police family suffered a devastating loss through aubreys ultimate sacrifice
4318332 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
4318333 its not like theres one person involved there are six
4318334 the imformation is scant at the moment we know all five were taken into custody they were arrested after climbing an olympic billboard near a transmission centre
4318335 the oss was the most eclectic group of people ever organized in an intelligence agency
4318336 im for strengthening the dollar but i also think weve got to have the economic policies in place for a stronger economy that will over time make sure that the dollar will be stronger
4318337 if there is one bright spot in this dismal economic picture it is exports and the exports will contribute over time to the betterment of our economy and a stronger dollar
4318338 im all for it and i love to talk it up talk up the strong dollar and i will
4318339 yahoo needs someone to help fix the business and i dont know if icahn has the background to do that
4318340 i just gave it absolutely everything i dont care im all done
4318341 ive had the best time and i think thats the most important part im just so happy in my life that i couldnt care less

4318345 dead zones were once rare but now theyre commonplace and there are more of them in more places
4318346 but things can change and theres no guarantee that we wont be seeing blooms of algae in the future here too so we need to be really vigilant
4318347 a sobering documentation of the growing threat of nutrient pollution in coastal waters around the world
4318348 the conclusion is inescapable that dead zones are now a key stressor in coastal waters
4318349 the evidence suggests that if the spigot of nutrients can be turned off coastal systems can recover
4318350 doing it can be accomplished by using fertilizers more efficiently preventing human and animal sewage from entering rivers and replanting vegetation along riverbanks to absorb excess nutrients
4318351 however nutrient inputs are again rising there as agriculture expands and a return to hypoxic conditions may be imminent

4318354 can this really be true no it cant this cheated the audience all over the world everyone will remember this beautiful little girl in red who has basked in the glory but the voice is another girls
4318355 its like the chinese saying gold and jade on the outside but just cotton on the inside so what if the girl who actually sang is losing her teeth thats still lovely in itself it just shows how young she is
4318356 its what should be happening at her age it shows how innocent she is this was a deliberate deception they should have explained on screen that the voice was another girls if i were the girl cast aside i would feel deeply hurt
4318357 its not fair on the girl who sang they wanted a girl with both a beautiful face and a beautiful voice someone else might have just accepted it but if it happened to me i wouldnt have done
4318358 after all they are both chinese girls it was the biggest stage of all and i think the girl who appeared there would also have liked to have her voice heard if i were zhang yimou the producer thats what i would have done too
4318359 we gave everyone a short lesson in the rules of softball on wednesday so they could enjoy the competition more its a new sport to most of us
4318360 the traffic is good in beijing during the games and the volunteers are doing a great job leading us to our seats the organisation seems excellent
4318361 we wanted them to experience the atmosphere of the olympics
4318362 when the australians scored a home run at the start i cheered for them but i was also worried for our team
4318363 represents the largest single photovoltaic commitment from an electric utility anywhere in the world
4318364 starts with the subjectivist assumption that we make our worlds but adds the important qualifier not out of thin air rather we make our peculiarly human worlds by apprehending a physical organic world external to us
4318365 a set of creative and purposive capacities that become denied through deskilling and mass production
4318366 those who know the truth are not equal to those that love it

4318371 im very excited about being in the semifinals of the olympic games
4318372 i felt like i was playing well today and i hope to continue playing like that
4318373 she started really very well i was just trying to stay positive trying to fight and i had nothing to lose i was trying to play more aggressive and that was the key to the match
4318374 i would say beating the no 1 player in the world has got to be up there

4318380 it is with considerable sadness then that we must temper the jubilation we know you all feel with the sobering news that todd and shonnah bentley are presently experiencing significant friction in their relationship and are currently separated
4318381 i was pleased with some of the things that we did especially on that drive where we went 90 yards
4318382 overall we did better today but we still have a lot of things that we need to improve on

4318402 when youre dealing with a series of programs that pays out billions of dollars every year you do the best you can to protect it
4318403 theres a lot of ways to get a hold of government money youre not entitled to
4318404 we investigated last year a total of about 10 000 cases and thats all of our cases not just the deceased payee cases
4318405 a deceased payee case thats money that was not rightfully paid out
4318406 but if we send you a benefit check and someone comes along and thumps you on the head and takes it thats not a theft from the government any more
4318407 its important to note that the victim in these cases is ssa which is why we investigate when benefits are paid to a living beneficiary and then stolen by a third party such a theft would not generally be within our jurisdiction
4318408 we investigate when someone makes a false claim for benefits based upon either completely fabricated or grossly exaggerated experiences
4318409 we also obviously would be interested in anybody who was not a veteran but claimed to be and was getting benefits
4318410 frequently but not exclusively its a family member or friend somebody who knows enough about the person to convincingly portray the person
4318411 we match va monetary benefits with social securitys death file
4318412 we assign these out to agents and when time permits they investigate
4318413 further tighten that net to be sure deaths dont go unreported
4318414 theres a number of ways we find out about a death
4318415 social security receives death information from multiple sources funeral homes state agencies other family members so its not as easy as it might sound to continue receiving the money
4318416 your parent passes away and you think if i dont tell social security im going to keep getting the money but its not that easy
4318417 i know they have in a number of years done projects with folks over a certain age
4318418 they go confirm the person receiving benefits and its hard to claim innocence once youre caught
4318419 most of our cases arent about stealing someone elses benefits its about stealing benefits you arent entitled to
4318420 its hard to have someone pass away without social security aware of it and when it does happen we will act and investigate
4318421 as apparent from the indictments handed down theft of government funds is not isolated to one program or agency
4318422 many people rely on these benefits each of these agencies has dedicated special agents charged with investigating theft of the funds they administer and with my office we are united in combating the threat to these programs and the beneficiaries they serve
4318423 they should call here because its very likely you could be dealing with a u s railroad retirement board matter and if you look in the front of the phone book theres no number for the board so well help sift through it
4318424 we are the central place where these matters are brought to a head
4318425 it is generally a cooperative effort among all federal and state agencies
4318426 often these sorts of cases are exclusively the jurisdiction of the office of the inspector general for each of the agencies and while postal inspectors or fbi agents can investigate these sorts of crimes theyve got a lot of other crimes to investigate as well and thats why these agencies have dedicated agents
4318427 we dont work those kinds of cases very often since most of those benefits are direct deposit
4318428 we just dont see that much of it because usually theyre defrauding specific agencies and every agency has its own investigators
4318429 from a taxpayer point of view the more money that is being spent to prevent or detect or prosecute this type of crime is money that is not being spent elsewhere
4318430 not only do we all of us pay into the social security fund but the businesses pay into it and they match as well
4318431 a lot of it relies on honest people because you just cant police everything
4318432 our hope was to highlight the problem because it is a significant problem that directly affects the demographic profile of our state
4318433 its an excellent opportunity or i wouldnt make the change
4318434 the size of the job is enormous in comparison to what im doing now its a daunting task i face but i like challenges and thats why im making this move
4318435 making decisions about the future is a long and complex process
4318436 its all about looking at the positive and negative of where you are going and where you are leaving the major thing to me is that there is not any one event here but the opportunity there
4318437 its a reflection of the tremendous strength we have here
4318438 theyve earned the top positions across the country we just have to move on
4318439 quite honestly i dont think its a big issue were doing what we can to ensure were competitive with faculty salaries
4318440 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
4318441 to the mall the playground play dates to target just to go somewhere
4318442 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
4318443 we just dont have as much money as we used to
4318444 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
4318445 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
4318446 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
4318447 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
4318448 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
4318449 we are not staying home with our children by default
4318450 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
4318451 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
4318452 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
4318453 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
4318454 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
4318455 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
4318456 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
4318457 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
4318458 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
4318459 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves

4318461 this is just like a pair of levis its more than just a symbol of the west its iconic american fashion people think of their grandfathers having worn it and now their grandsons wear it theres not many things that cross the generations like this does
4318462 he met a lot of celebrities through the years and never knew who any of them were
4318463 he loved meeting people and talking to them about where they were from and why they were here it was his sense of joy
4318464 more than anything else he and my father taught me how to run a family business
4318465 we didnt do what the big companies do we kept our manufacturing local we survived nafta and we stayed true to who we are and who my grandfather was thats why people wear our shirts theyre unique
4318466 he was always bemused that all this had come to a country boy from indiana
4318467 papa jack was a big part of what makes denver and the west he was part of our brand
4318468 identity thieves will take your credit card and swipe it through this device and this device pulls all the information off the magnetic stripe
4318469 then by virtue of that theyre able to take this device connect it to a computer and upload that information onto the computer itself
4318470 it kind of makes you more hesitant about who you give your card to and what theyre actually going to use it for
4318471 it makes you want to look at your receipt more carefully
4318472 this worries me cause i see it every day i guard my paperwork better and look at it better and more often
4318473 my biggest tip to anyone is obviously when you get your credit or debit card statement give it the appropriate attention i mean weve all got a bad habit of taking a credit card statement signing off on it and paying it without really giving it the appropriate attention it deserves
4318474 if youre going to pull up to a pump and use your credit card to pay for your gas take a good look at the device youre putting your credit card into
4318475 it kind of makes you wonder what other means they have to secure your finances
4318476 and with rising gas prices and the economy going into the depression were in a little bit it makes you wonder where your moneys at
4318477 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4318478 people trafficking has reached epidemic proportions over the past decade with a global annual market of about 42 5 billion
4318479 the global sex slave industry is controlled by large organized crime gangs and supported by the governments of many countries that benefit from the money involved this is money that is circulated around the world at the expense of innocent women and children being sold into slavery for sex
4318480 the most disturbing response that i typically hear people retort when they do become aware of this holocaust is oh its the oldest profession in the world it will always be around i would like to applaud and support with my own money groups such as the not for profit human rights organization the catw that work diligently to get laws passed through the u n to fight this industry from becoming the biggest industry on the face of the earth
4318481 omg what the hell was i doing there is no way this is going on the internet

4318492 this is a de facto regulatory agency they just dont call it that
4318493 it corresponds to nothing we know about the constitutional landscape
4318494 i see a lot of money generated from the tobacco settlement being used to fund new investigations
4318495 we cant sit around and act as some imperial force to enact policy however we want to
4318496 we dont have the resources that the defense has for expert advisers and the like
4318497 these are the prosecutors its their decision to settle the litigation and now theyre seeking money for their coffers
4318498 it kind of reminds me of vladimir putin invading georgia
4318499 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
4318500 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
4318501 it kind of reminds me of vladimir putin invading georgia
4318502 it kind of reminds me of vladimir putin invading georgia
4318503 this book and books like it destroy our political culture undermine fair elections inhabit the slippery space between politics and slander
4318504 these books destroy civic debate on purpose and are fundamentally at odds with democracy
4318505 that is not just factually wrong it is wildly immoral whether or not corsi published lies is not even half the discussion we should be having
4318506 it is hard to conceive of an america in which journalists use their broadcast power to protect our civic culture rather than promote shadowy figures who seek to destroy it but imagining it is the first step

4318529 you think you just laugh your head off when the crackerjacks come in
4318530 but when theyre standing in front of you and they really believe theyve got talent its hard to laugh it feels wrong
4318531 every aspect is just an intense environment to be in
4318532 theres a little too much of me i can watch myself perform back because thats what i love to do but watching yourself talking or hearing your own answerphone message im not comfortable with me
4318533 im still not comfortable being called a judge its quite nerve racking
4318534 there have been a couple of disagreements im not there to go along with what everyone is saying
4318535 i find it quite insulting i happen to think that women in their 30s are at their most attractive
4318536 and shes probably got more wisdom and more life experience than me
4318537 its over with he made his mistake apologized and we moved on
4318538 theres nothing to be said he knew he messed up he recognized it right away weve moved on already
4318539 he felt remorse enough that five minutes after it happened he apologized its not something to harp on
4318540 it didnt cost us the win and if it did cost us the win it didnt cost us the season he thought he hit the ball out of the park it didnt go out of the park and he ended up at first base sori works as hard as anybody else on this team if not harder
4318541 hes one of the best in the game for a superstar to act the way he acts and work as hard as he does its very refreshing
4318542 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4318543 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4318544 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4318545 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4318546 one step further for china to open up and i think its a very good gesture

4318550 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4318551 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4318552 georgia is an independent and sovereign state and i think this formula the principle of sovereignty is broader than the formula of territorial integrity
4318553 the west has spent a lot of time energy and money to teach georgia the tricks of the trade to make the country look like a democracy
4318554 we and many other nations see through this deceit we understand that the seditious tactics of the so called colour revolutions are a real threat to international law and the source of global legal nihilism
4318555 in the old days under soviet rule we didnt believe a word of our own propaganda but we thought that information was free in the west and we longed for it
4318556 but we have learnt since that the west has its own propaganda and in some ways it is more powerful because people believe it

4318559 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4318560 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4318561 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions
4318562 i would have felt very confident at the time that the top place to look was at ft detrick
4318563 l ike every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4318564 when a movie overperforms the way dark knight has you really dont need harry potter in the fall
4318565 turning a battleship that big isnt easy youre not talking just about the movie but all the merchandising the toys and stuff its huge and it has a domino effect across the rest of the summer slate
4318566 sen obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle class wage earners
4318567 thats why his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000 not income taxes capital gains taxes dividend or payroll taxes
4318568 i think it will be a very positive message and i know that im looking forward to it brewster said
4318569 the exciting thing for me is that it seems like hes really trying to make something positive out of this you look at different situations and try to learn from them because thats all you can do

4318574 todos estos factores juntos son m s que suficientes para hacerle el esc ner
4318575 son procedimientos de rutina que se deben hacer sobre la marcha se tarda muy poco en ello y evitan muchos problemas
4318576 una lesi n de este tipo puede tardar algunas horas o d as en salir pero cuando ya vuelve al hospital con esos dolores demuestra que hab a algo importante hasta entonces ha podido estar larvado o m s o menos oculto

4318578 im speechless this is unbelievable its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be a part of this team

4318584 i think its a natural evolution in warfare its just a reflection of modern times thats the way armies communicate they do things through computer networks just like the rest of the world does
4318585 of course theyre going to leverage or exploit those types of communication it would be nave to think it wasnt going to happen
4318586 i saw a ball of flame and people flying in the air
4318587 a minute later people told me that i was bleeding from my back the police transferred me to iskandariyah hospital
4318588 the army will replace the police in iskandariyah after this security violation
4318589 the police are not capable to deal with the suicide attacks they dont have detectors and the necessary equipment for these kind of attacks

4318606 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4318607 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4318608 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4318609 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4318610 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4318611 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4318612 this golf course actually sets up better for me than forest oaks did
4318613 this is more of a placement off the tee kind of golf course and hitting the greens and making some putts forest oaks was more of a shootout see how many birdies you can make if you hit it long you had an advantage over here you dont youve got to place it around the golf course which is kind of more suited to my game

4318617 the israel which seeks peace and reconciliation and an end to the shameful occupation or the israel which is addicted to occupation and expansion
4318618 youd expect congress to be holding hearings on how to fix things or to examine american policy toward israel the keystone of u s policy in the region
4318619 but the israel lobby wont allow a critical examination of our relationship the lobby demands the united states support israel generously and unconditionally and it gets what it wants
4318620 the lobby meets with every candidate running for congress and asks them to offer a position paper on israel palestine
4318621 monitors their voting records and steers money toward favored candidates if a candidate is deemed hostile theyll steer donations to his opponent
4318622 if there is a hearing about u s foreign policy only one side is allowed to speak those vetted by aipac no critic of israel is allowed to testify
4318623 their top priority is to protect israel one would think it would be to protect the united states

4318627 i was told hard stuff like ecstasy and ketamine are also being sold here personally i have not seen the drugs but a lot of people talk about it once i sat under the block and was approached by a man in his 20s looking for su street name for subutex do i look like a drug dealer
4318628 there used to be a group of boys who sold cigarettes and sex pills just across the road at the park bench at block 444 they disappeared when they were exposed in the newspapers
4318629 they wont anyhow sell it to you if you come with me i can recommend you to them they will sell you power pills cheaper
4318630 dont take one or two because no kick take five or more and you will feel shiok its the same high as erimin 5 only cheaper
4318631 given the possible involvement of illegal drug syndicates hsa will work with the relevant enforcement agencies such as the central narcotics bureau and the police to look further into the reports of illegal activities in those areas
4318632 i am here to honor the spirits of the dead because i want to thank those who worked for the nation

4318659 andrews moving to minnesota thats why he hasnt been here this week
4318660 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4318661 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4318662 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4318663 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4318664 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4318665 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4318666 we cant find a way to make it work in our country
4318667 everyone plays it young and old and it has important symbolic meaning
4318668 you have to focus but sometimes i might look at what is happening at another table

4318671 fizemos um jogo bem controlado no primeiro tempo t nhamos uma proposta bem definida de preencher espa o de n o dar espa o para eles fomos muito bem at acima da expectativa tivemos oportunidades um gol e outras depois controlamos bem mas infelizmente levamos o gol no final do primeiro tempo m rito do advers rio mas foi um gol de desaten o
4318672 com 2 a 1 a gente levava at um bom resultado para o mineir o pois precisar amos de um gol para poder classificar mas n o tem desespero achei que melhoramos hoje teve uma evolu o diante de um trabalho recente mas temos de evoluir muito mais ainda
4318673 temos menos de duas semanas de comando no atl tico fizemos tr s ou quatro treinamentos apenas o atl tico se encontrava em 17 lugar e agora est em 12 no campeonato brasileiro foi uma evolu o mas hoje achei que foi equilibrado controlado aconteceu uma evolu o sim mas temos que manter isso estar sempre evoluindo

4318707 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4318708 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party
4318709 both parties welcomed the establishment of a process to provide fair compensation for their respective nationals and thereby turn their focus to the future of their bilateral relationship
4318710 they allow this horrible terrorist who murdered my daughter and all these other people to triumph this is a triumph for terrorism
4318711 all this does it says we swept the families away we pretend that gadhafi never blew up an american plane
4318712 the agreement provides some justice and closure for the victims of libyan terrorism and their families
4318713 but it is small consolation and will not bring back the lives that have been lost nor undo the suffering endured by survivors
4318714 we went through a long path of negotiations until we reached this agreement
4318715 it opens new horizons for relations based on mutual respect the agreement turns the page on the negative past forever
4318716 a lot of stories you read about young kids are negative

4318725 our centre will employ both leading russian researchers and x5 professionals with considerable industry expertise such cooperation will enable us to look at retail chains and the industry as a whole from different angles we will analyse international and russian experience with focus on regulation pricing brand creation and promotion it systems in retail and many other issues that play an important role in its future development
4318726 creation of the retail research centre by isa ran which is well known for its interdisciplinary research represents our reply to the actual sectors needs

4318733 it was very harrowing but everybody rose to the occasion and we just threw everything we could at trying to help and trying to get support in
4318734 gottlieb was one of the most incredible people i have ever seen i have had so many beaut trips with him
4318735 and we got to the hut door and two people went inside the hut and gottlieb came back out of the hut and collapsed on the snow
4318736 we dont really know what the real cause is we are just guessing its a heart attack hes such a fit strong man its the last thing i thought would have taken him
4318737 she made a special effort to come out in the dark last night it was probably a bit scary coming down the mountain in the snow partially on a skidoo

4318742 im an illiterate who has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance that i can get
4318743 you dont necessarily have to use a computer to understand how it shapes the country john mccain is aware of the internet
4318744 basically john is a technological troglodyte and proud of it
4318745 broadband will soon be an indispensable communication technology affecting the way we learn the way we work and the way we communicate
4318746 however at the dawn of this digital age those who could benefit the most from this economically empowering technology are also those most likely to be left without access because of where they live or how much money they make
4318747 the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength
4318748 what concerns me is that mccain will do as george bush did which is to make technology an issue related to how he raises money to run the government or to fund campaigns and not as an independent issue that is important to grow america
4318749 technology for the bush administration is a total non issue even though that was the thing that drove most growth in 1992 to 2003 and the reason i think hed be led to that is because hes a guy who doesnt understand anything about technology in the first place
4318750 i think that the people who determine his tech policies like former fcc chairman michael powell and a few others who were his top advisors will talk as bush has talked about getting advanced telecommunications services to all americans
4318751 but mainly their model is to allow the industry to determine what all this means which is the danger
4318752 far too little oversight to the good things in the 1996 telecommunications act
4318753 making sure there were equal opportunities to participate in the industry afforded to women and minorities and small businesses
4318754 there was a rush to essentially allow industry players to get into each others businesses and consolidate in the industry
4318755 their bush and mccain belief is that government should just get out of the way and let the private sector do it clearly in the financial markets the private sector has done a horrible job
4318756 the thing that stands out for his entire tenure is that he has never had a priority and has never had to my knowledge any accomplishment of any kind at all
4318757 the prevention lies not in censoring what goes into the internet
4318758 but rather in filtering what comes out of it onto the computers our children use outside the home
4318759 we took a major step forward when we decided to wire every school and library in america to the internet thats a good program
4318760 part of the concern was that there had been frankly too little debate about the act before the public and that the broadcasters were getting extraordinary benefits without sufficient return to the public for what they were doing
4318761 unless there is a clear cut unequivocal restraint of competition the government should stay out of it
4318762 by redrawing the ownership and competition rules that govern the industry it has created incentives both intended and unintended for companies to merge
4318763 mccain was encouraging the notion of competition but really did very little to limit consolidation
4318764 well im not going to attempt to do that i think its a cheeky argument
4318765 mccain sees the internet mainly as a business and trusts market forces to foster innovation for societys benefit

4318823 penyelidik sebab kematian secara resmi sudah menyatakan michael jackson telah meninggal dari apa yang kami temukan dia telah meninggal antara 18 hingga 20 tahun lalu
4318824 kami tak yakin siapa atau apa yang berdiri di pengadilan santa maria itu saat ini
4318825 kami secara positif mengenali jasad itu sebagai jackson dari laporan giginya dan dna
4318826 tetapi sebelum kami mengadakan satu tes forensik kami sudah mencurigai bahwa kami tidak dapat mengungkap michael asli dan bahwa sosok meresahkan yang dituntut sebagai jackson itu adalah palsu
4318827 penemuan ini menimbulkan banyak pertanyaan tetapi juga memberi titik terang pada sejumlah insiden yang meresahkan saat ini

4318838 traditional media are facing a secular shift as a result of changes in consumer behaviour and the migration of advertisers to new platforms
4318839 theres never a wrong time to do the right thing
4318840 traditional media are facing a secular shift as a result of changes in consumer behaviour and the migration of advertisers to new platforms
4318841 it can be quite difficult to resolve who has the right to a revenue stream when those rights have been badly documented and passed on from one company to another as labels faced bankruptcy or some other crisis
4318842 it is a classic scenario that is likely to lead to a dispute in court
4318843 some of the cdo and cds documents leave a lot to be desired and contain basic errors the fear is that as the courts get involved we are going to have some unpleasant surprises
4318844 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning
4318845 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
4318846 could help explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer in patients especially those who have had lots of sun exposure
4318847 moisturiser use is much greater among women however skin cancers and in particular the type of skin cancers studied in this research seem to be more common among men prof sinclair said
4318848 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication mr greenoak said
4318849 but then i looked at his name again and saw it backwards
4318850 a bright light shining down from a cloud and three voices talking in unison
4318851 whats interesting to me is that you cannot help but feel that his initial feelings of being disgruntled are merited and i feel a lot of empathy for the lucifer character in the beginning of the story
4318852 i would want the audience to be sympathetic with him at the beginning and what happens what hes up against and what hes wrestling and struggling with you certainly feel that
4318853 in the movie satan goes from being a completely good being an angel to becoming the most heinous kind of evil and you really have a hard time knowing exactly where he crossed that line because you were with him
4318854 what is interesting about that story in the way milton laid it out is that people jump off with him at different points and some never at all properly done its a story that tells readers a lot about themselves
4318855 you have to respect that milton created the first anti hero with that poem and certainly this was preserved in the script
4318856 at what point does love turn to jealousy jealousy turn into hate and hate into evil
4318857 what it encompasses is still a fraction of the poem and has to be because you could make a 50 hour miniseries out of it if you wanted to but it really covers end to end the basic events of the poem
4318858 thats a big part of the process im in right now in terms of working on both artwork and just conceptualizing how to do something
4318859 theres cgi and then theres versions that are blends of the two live action and cg and i think the best version of the movie is going to have a lot of blending in it
4318860 it would not be an easy movie to make but it would be ground breaking
4318861 scott derrickson says his paradise lost film might lead to sympathy for the devil
4318862 durch das urteil ist jetzt auch vattenfall gezwungen den im n chsten genehmigungszeitraum anzusetzenden betrag f r die durchleitung von strom durch ihre netze um 50 millionen euro zu verringern das kommt vor allem stromkunden im norden und osten deutschlands zu gute
4318863 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
4318864 shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders
4318865 what is actually happening here is a systematic approach to organised transnational crime where were trying to de layer it and expose it and increase the number of seizures that weve been operating with customs on
4318866 john holland had senior executives in tasmania today discussing the project and their role in it
4318867 so wherever mr king is getting his information its not from his senior executives
4318868 you could have asked me those questions last year and you could have asked me the questions the year before that and i think youll be able to ask me the same questions next year and the year after that and the year after that
4318869 in summary i dont think its the mill ever going to happen
4318870 i believe there are many more hurdles and there is a lot of water to go under the bridge until that gets built
4318871 gunns are still pursuing completion of funding and permits and until we have a definitive answer from gunns we understand the project is still under way
4318872 at the end of the day anyone would kill to have a silver medal at the olympics

4318875 es m s f cil saber qui n filtr la noticia en materia de la utilizaci n de los logo s mbolos cruz roja que saber qui n filtr la noticia sobre el roscograma
4318876 yo no estuve al comienzo de la reuni n cuando tocaron el tema del roscograma lo nico que not cuando entr fue una sonrisa maliciosa de los congresistas por ese tema
4318877 los dichos populares siempre son buenos o todos en la cama o todos en el suelo o establecemos unos impedimentos generales para parlamentarios para la rama ejecutiva y para la rama judicial otra tesis es que levantemos las inhabilidades
4318878 para nadie es un secreto que en colombia ha existido el roscograma dentro de los diferentes pilares del poder
4318879 se tiene que hacer una norma clara de que si hay p rdida de investidura para un congresista por tr fico de influencias entonces que tambi n exista para todos los rganos del poder
4318880 eso es una realidad lo que importa es que sea transparente y que no haya tr fico de influencias por debajo de la mesa
4318881 o se proh be para todos o se incluye a todos pero no puede ser que no haya claridad en el asunto y a unos se juzguen y a otros no
4318882 el presidente est jugando una estrategia equivocada que es tratar de desprestigiar a la corte y salir a decir que all hay un roscograma utilizando un lenguaje tan prosaico
4318883 est tratando de desvertebrar este esquema constitucional y crear el que el presidente puede discutir de t a t con la corte intervenir en los procesos y decidir c mo se eligen los magistrados es decir apoderarse del poder judicial
4318884 el pr ximo jueves nos vamos a reunir con el ministro para buscar una concertaci n del proyecto que tiene el gobierno y nuestras propuestas
4318885 the australian automotive industry has been transformed to a more globally integrated and competitive industry

4318894 she gave some examples of how we all know our opinions are less valuable than facts and demonstrate so by inserting qualifying phrases before we offer an opinion in a discussion
4318895 i know this is not necessarily valid but heres my take on the situation
4318896 i have no power over my own thoughts but i feel the need to share them with you anyway
4318897 i didnt think the author was literally referring to his eyes instead i thought he meant it figuratively that is he meant to say examine me closely as i read i found there was a double meaning
4318898 i already knew a little bit this was something that people would say to the child
4318899 people should not be afraid of their government the government should be afraid of its people
4318900 die komt na een rustdag als renners doorgaans niet goed weten hoe de benen aanvoelen de drager van de gele trui moet maar hopen dat hij dan geen slechte dag heeft

4318904 customers who find our waitresses rude ought to see the manager
4318905 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4318906 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4318907 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4318908 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west
4318909 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4318910 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4318911 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4318912 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4318913 this defining moment in our history and bring the party together
4318914 she is going to get her moment she really earned this
4318915 obama showed that he is a leader who unites the democratic party
4318916 he is giving former clinton supporters more and more reasons to support him
4318917 shes going to be encouraging her supporters to vote for obama
4318918 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4318919 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4318920 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4318921 if someone wants to discuss changes to that theyre going to have to bring that up with us
4318922 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4318923 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4318924 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4318925 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4318926 has been very very difficult for the city and for the state
4318927 why dont you ask the trees grass sky why only to me
4318928 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4318929 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it

4318938 was a written progress report given to the mayor and council if so please send a copy to because that will hopefully have some of the hard numbers about what services could be shared and how many dollars would be saved by merging those services

4318948 budget cuts are something we are going to have to start talking about
4318949 and we like a lot of other health departments were already underfunded at that number
4318950 it doesnt look good for 2010 the drop in funding is disconcerting and puts the knox county board of heath in a difficult position of having to make some decisions in terms of what can be cut
4318951 by not providing core services we are compounding access to health care issues

4318974 i send greetings to those celebrating the 61st anniversary of indias independence
4318975 led by mahatma gandhi the indian people engaged in non violent protests and campaigns in the pursuit of freedom
4318976 on august 15 1947 they achieved their goal gained their independence and became a democratic nation this accomplishment demonstrates that though freedom can be delayed it cannot be denied
4318977 it is also a time to remember the rich contributions that the indian americans have made to our country and reminds us of the close ties that our nation shares with india

4318981 it is clear that libertarians and old rightists including myself had made a great mistake in endorsing domestic red baiting a red baiting that proved to be the major entering wedge for the complete transformation of the original right wing
4318982 big government and domestic statism were perfectly acceptable provided that they were steeped in some sort of burkean tradition and enjoyed a christian framework
4318983 in which the government acknowledges no restraint upon its powers
4318984 the government is organized to operate the capitalist system and enable it to function under an immense bureaucracy
4318985 militarism is used as a conscious mechanism of government spending
4318986 imperialism is included as a policy inevitably flowing from militarism
4318987 wherever you find a nation using all of these devices
4318988 the corruption which flourished at the top in spain and which the spanish oligarchs moved to defend by making alliances with mussolini and replicating his politics in that country brought about a massive mobilization of the trade unions and other workers and farmers organizations
4318989 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
4318990 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4318991 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
4318992 neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy the only evil that walks invisible
4318993 i think a certain amount of tension is very healthy
4318994 soldiers are taught to expect the unexpected and accept it and revise improvise and fight their way through adversity
4318995 knowledge of the past and the future helps people find balance in the present
4318996 we have had to simultaneously fight the taliban build more than a dozen defensive strongpoints train new afghan national police and conduct civic action programs to win over the local population and were doing it our motto ready for all yielding to none says it all
4318997 nothing in the field manuals could fully prepare us for this but we adapt and overcome
4318998 the states public school students improved yet again in reading writing and mathematics marking five years of near steady growth on the tough california standards test according to results released thursday by the department of education
4318999 but the good news came paired with bad as state superintendent jack oconnell declared that the education of black students has reached a crisis stage overall scores remain well below those of white students and english skills generally match those of students just learning the language
4319000 i am acutely concerned about our african american stdents oconnell said noting that low academic proficiency and a high dropout rate
4319001 some families from the name of a place in sindh arrived at the name of a place in karachi and were taken upon by the name of one linguistic group who misbehaved with their women
4319002 their bodies were painted red and they were stripped naked one linguistic group has given the name of another group a deadline to leave an area in karachi think are you going to do something or just talk send this sms to all one linguistic group so that the nation awakens long live the name of a political leader
4319003 an elder from a place in the punjab has told the people of sindh in a message to pray a certain prayer and ask their friends to do so because a great tragedy is about to befall the province he sent a similar message to balakot as well before the earthquake happened

4319006 the do not call register has proved extremely popular however the government is aware that there is some community demand to allow the registration of fax numbers and the telephone numbers used by organisations such as small businesses
4319007 this would stop normal business to business commerce it would have huge ramifications
4319008 the photocopier salesman couldnt just ring around and get appointments without checking yet this is a legitimate business activity
4319009 but they have the option of listing their home number on the register
4319010 we have to be very careful we are not cracking a nut with a sledge hammer
4319011 this shows the register is now accepted by the community however i am not sure what an annoyance it is for business but it is probably a good initiative it might be a problem for small business
4319012 this is a good result in a tight retail environment in which the combination of record fuel prices and higher interest rates are influencing consumer sentiment
4319013 high interest rates and an extremely onerous set of local state and federal government taxes and charges on new housing continue to slug new home buyers

4319017 did you tell my boy there were monsters in the woods
4319018 i just told him and his buddies about the twooly mammoth

4319021 are working feverishly to produce a patch that will nullify any attempts to alter thermostat settings inside the eactivator and esynchro series of electric razors
4319022 with all i have to do these days how could i pay attention to the olympic games
4319023 self step out of your rock and roll comfort zone and educate yourself a bit
4319024 there have been 39 world records long and short course this year and 90 of them were in speedo
4319025 that of course does something to the athletes its almost impossible to put yourself in a state of mind where you say it doesnt matter of course it matters
4319026 or they may end up at home watching on nbc
4319027 clearly produced an atmosphere of anxiety confusion and uncertainty that has been amplified and hyped by the media throughout the world
4319028 it will be fair because we have a rule that says the swimsuits should be available for all the swimmers so everybody can have access to the swimsuits they want fina chief cornel marculescu said
4319029 truly weve been able to leverage his popularity with all of our accounts because he has transcended swimming
4319030 its helping speedo become cooler and addressing a younger market outside just that core competitive swimmer
4319031 once they did an action they never went back to that place
4319032 and the people involved in that action would never talk about it ever
4319033 they would pick their targets sometimes a year in advance and do significant surveillance getting the timing down of the guards if there are any if there are people there
4319034 their main thing was that they always claimed they didnt hurt anybody so they were very vigilant to make sure they watched a place so that nobody was in there
4319035 they would steal their clothes or get them out of goodwill secondhand type stores all black
4319036 theyd go in at night with police scanners and radios and then afterwards theyd get rid of their clothes even sometimes going as far as getting new tires for whatever vehicles they used
4319037 they have these small autonomous groups that dont know each other and they just go out and commit acts and usually the groups are four or five max
4319038 they dont use their real names they use made up nicknames codenames and thats the way they always refer to each other and they do that supposedly so when they get arrested even if they try to cooperate they cant
4319039 spain has a huge commune type area and so at least weve been told from the national police there it would be a good place for her to be if she was wanted anywhere in the world
4319040 shes a very good shoplifter which all these people were
4319041 thats how they got all their material to build these devices by shoplifting
4319042 make no mistake a ba aa alliance would be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the uk and us aviation industry
4319043 i think its a question of just how much is enough competition
4319044 if you look out of the uk youve already got 21 carriers operating scheduled services at the moment across the north atlantic
4319045 i think ba would argue that by reducing the number and synchronising services they could provide a more efficient operation and reduce costs
4319046 few of us thought that we would ever look back fondly at 90 a barrel oil
4319047 but as you all know the rise in the price of oil and by extension jet fuel has accelerated during the past several months to extraordinary levels
4319048 the slowing us economy and our industrys persistent overcapacity have prevented us or any other airline from pricing our product in a way that reflects our skyrocketing costs

4319065 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4319066 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4319067 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4319068 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4319069 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4319070 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4319071 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4319072 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in
4319073 the longer and longer this negotiation went on the more i could see myself coming back
4319074 i was pretty much ready to go ive matured a lot more since high school and im glad that my decision out of high school was to go to texas
4319075 i didnt really have a specific number of what my price was i just told the white sox that i have no problem with going back to texas i guess thats why this took so long
4319076 we hear a lot about how the linebackers dont do this they dont do that but we know what weve got and we know how hard weve been working
4319077 i think people are going to be surprised at how much better we will be this year im telling you theres a lot of talent at linebacker
4319078 they are bracketed at the middle linebacker spot and are co starters in my eyes
4319079 they are both going to play they are both guys we can win with
4319080 were important i suppose because the secondary is kind of young
4319081 but thats just an excuse everybodys saying the secondary is young we just want to control the line of scrimmage play hard make sure everybody is on the same page because were pretty much the quarterbacks of the defense making sure everybody is doing what theyre supposed to be doing lined up right and everything
4319082 hes got initial quickness hes got good ball get off
4319083 hes a very strong upper body guy so he can power the tackles and hes got god given pass rush ability so youve got to utilize his talents and put him in a situation where he can be successful
4319084 if we mess up were going to play the next play but were going to play it fast and physical no half stepping were just going to try to come out from the start to finish thats what were going to show the fans that were real physical and tough
4319085 ive got a strange feeling and not sure if you have the same one for me
4319086 i dont want to be with you youve lost your chance

4319094 hi mara i am writing because i am interested in any available bill clintons activities in 1989 while he was governor of your state first of all i should say that for your investigative work on both the boys on the tracks and the devils knot you are a hero of mine both books were so courageous and extremely well researched and written which brings me to the reason i am writing you see i have written a book of my own based on some very strange experiences i had in september 1989 which believe it or not involved bill clinton here is a synopsis letter i have been sending to publishers and keep in mind that i am not trying to solicit you or spam you i am just looking for info on clinton re 1989 and anything that might indicate that he was also working in concert with a clandestine federal operation thanks in advance for reading here is my synopsis of a true story
4319095 hello adam extremely bizarre is right good luck to you in finding a publisher i cannot offer any help regarding gov clintons possible involvement in the events you describe beyond the activities at mena during the 1980s i know nothing about any relationship between arkansas or its governor and clandestine federal operations mara

4319180 theres a utmost apprehension that women ought against have place efficient into manifesto caritas individual on terms inner man fall shy into leaving out consequences thats the cut strategy in regard to the entirety these bills
4319181 the recent incidents in the state of jammu and kashmir are a cause for concern in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4319182 security in the city has been increased after the recent bomb blasts in ahmedabad and bangalore all police officials have been directed to be on high alert

4319189 its a challenge to us to reach the level that we reached in auckland and maybe even surpass it
4319190 thats what great teams do consistently reach that level we dont doubt that this team has got the heart to do it but its a big challenge to take that intensity and level offshore and put it to work at newlands
4319191 so id imagine therell be periods when theres a lot of open play

4319198 at the end of the day all 15 guys have to buy in and be competitive at the breakdown its not just down to me it starts with the forward pack but all 15 guys have the responsibility to clean out well
4319199 big test matches like this are almost always 50 50
4319200 i hope we can play some proper rugby and sneak home but theyre going to be tough to beat as they showed in the last game against australia

4319216 i think it serves to make my point really that weve got all these badges that are lost and we dont know where they are and they absolutely look like a badge and can be utilized by anyone who finds them to impersonate a peace officer

4319218 i came in and there were police officers outside they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
4319219 the majority of our community here are kashmiri we have never had any problems and have a very good relationship with the kashmiri community and have done so for a very long time
4319220 this has had no effect on the airport it is a total police operation and we didnt even know that it had happened until afterwards
4319221 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned

4319225 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4319226 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4319227 i think that there is an effort to try and redress what they regard as many of the concessions they feel were forced upon them in the early 1990s after the collapse of the soviet union
4319228 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4319229 our collaboration with amd is especially important to us because it provides us with early access to some of the latest graphics technology
4319230 delivering a polished game experience is one of our top priorities and this relationship helps us achieve that goal for blizzard gamers who choose amd graphics cards
4319231 the truth is that only recently have we had this kind of 3d power where were able to create a real starcraft experience in 3d what we want to see are hundreds of vehicles and creatures clashing on the battlefield with dynamic lighting and shadows and all of these dazzling special effects thats the kind of gaming experience that our players expect from us
4319232 blizzard entertainment is responsible for the hottest titles in pc gaming and amd is excited to be working closely with one of the top development teams in the industry to deliver exceptional gaming experiences for players around the world
4319233 gamers have a variety of choices when it comes to graphics cards
4319234 those who choose ati radeon solutions can be confident their purchase will give them the visually rich high performance experience they expect
4319235 you could describe it best as a two sided fuse
4319236 we lose guys on our current roster and we lose incoming guys this time its a major hit yes it turns out we might have a great player back but we lost a bunch of others we lost more from this team than an arizona state team has ever lost
4319237 if were going to finish in the top 10 again well have some work to do
4319238 we could be using seven or eight freshmen in the lineup and well have another brand new pitching staff
4319239 right now before we have something definitive on kipnis the only position not up for grabs on this team is right field
4319240 its going to be an extensive practice and teaching period but it will be fun
4319241 its all puppies out there i think well be picked close to the cellar in the pac 10 because we lost everybody and i dont think there will be a top 20 preseason ranking for the first time in a while
4319242 but i like the team i like who we recruited and i like the character of the guys they are the right guys
4319243 intimate apparel sale up to 79 off at bare necessities
4319244 in the light of the federal members of parliament not getting a pay rise this year i dont believe west australian mps should get one either i made that point
4319245 it feels great to get a win on the board this season
4319246 the girls played great today and theyre continuing to show improvement
4319247 our first doubles team played really well they buckled down and came back in the third set and our second doubles team also played a good match
4319248 all my singles players fought hard but both teams had some very good singles players
4319249 my first doubles team played really well all day though they were a little tired after their first match but they dug down and managed to pull it out
4319250 that was the first varsity match for olivia who is just a sophomore and i thought she played very well
4319251 the girl from green got off to a really good start in the third set and olivia couldnt quite recover
4319252 we had a couple set points in the first set of the second doubles match but just couldnt keep the ball in play but overall it was a very competitive match for us
4319253 were real excited about going down friday and getting in a game format where we dont have our plays scripted
4319254 well let our defense loose a little bit this scrimmage and let them get into some of their stunting and blitzing were just looking forward to it
4319255 it could be two series or it could be three
4319256 what we have to do this week is we have to make sure we get enough work to where we feel comfortable when myself and defensive coordinator steve kovacs and the coaching staff feels like all right weve gotten the work we want to accomplish then well move on from there
4319257 were going in with the mentality to get them game prep with the mentality of coming on and off the field and just all of the little things
4319258 offensively we ran our practice that way today its just getting them ready for that game format
4319259 we have a lot of kids who are competing at spots we might even have kids who are taking time at spots in the season thats great you have depth theres a handful of positions like that trust me youd rather have that going on than not
4319260 we got beat 3 1 but the score wasnt really what anyone was worried about
4319261 we just werent very physical we didnt play very good defense and offensively we werent very physical on that side of the ball when you dont have a lot of experience back on the varsity level the kids dont really realize what it takes to be successful as far as being physical i hope we have a clear picture of that after our first scrimmage
4319262 this scrimmage for us is going to be a big thing
4319263 were going to have to make some decisions about positions and what were going to do in a lot of places wed like to think we know where were going with some of them but we need to see some people some more and wed like to see us play harder than we did in the first scrimmage
4319264 we dont have a lot of experience back and thats one of the big things weve been dealing with in the preseason
4319265 weve been pretty disappointed that we havent been more physical on defense than we were in the first scrimmage
4319266 we need to be more physical and if we are thats going to be a big help for us because we sure werent very physical in our first scrimmage
4319267 im sure that some of it is because weve got a fair number of young players who just havent physically matured as of yet
4319268 latest antics show that the regime is not sincere on the dialogue process the detention is an affront to sadc to the african union and to the broader international community who are working hard to peacefully resolve zimbabwes crisis
4319269 i think we have a lot of leaders on this team but the guys they picked im very happy with who they picked theyve had a great summer all of those guys have worked hard all of those guys have shown some leadership skills prior to being picked i think thats why their teammates picked them they trust them and they know that theyll treat them fair
4319270 it is its a huge responsibility because theyre going to set them tempo of this team
4319271 this is their team everybody wants to say its coach halls team and yeah im the head coach but you know as well as i do that great leadership makes great teams these guys are working hard they ran their own conditioning wednesday im real happy with the selection theyre working hard and the teams working hard
4319272 were not going to push the issue with him really weve got a couple of concussion issues but were down to just a handful of guys four guys that might not be practicing thats typical for a two a day format
4319273 brandon was probably the most serious injury but hes been really working well and hes getting back up to almost full strength
4319274 as he keeps progressing well start getting him into practice
4319275 we actually held him out a little longer just to make sure he was healed up this early
4319276 it wasnt too bad on coach hall i think just getting here theyre taking it easy on me i pride myself on relationships and i have great relationships with all of those guys
4319277 i think the one thing people take for granted is all of us coaches up there were pretty decent friends were not enemies obviously we like to compete against each other but outside of football we get together at clinics its just a situation where youre getting friends together peers and anytime you do that us football guys can sit there and talk all night
4319278 the effort that im asking for is hard and theyre slowly getting it their attitude and their enthusiasm have gotten better the last couple of days we get through two a days now and have a couple more smiles from them
4319279 i want to see how we handle game like situations and see how we handle adversity and see how we react to it
4319280 i want us to be able to handle that and fight through that stuff obviously we want to go out and do well all the time but sometimes we learn more when we dont do well weve got to learn from the scrimmage regardless of what happens
4319281 i hope our effort is good and were fighting all of the time
4319282 i dont care about the scoreboard if we do that well enough and long enough then the scoreboard takes care of itself i look for attitude and effort from them mistakes well fix but weve got to be playing hard
4319283 since beginning here weve been trying to get the kids to fit into another position
4319284 i heard him scream and then i saw blood on the floor
4319285 red light they had to immediately stop drinking the goal of the game was to finish the glass of milk without drinking on the red light
4319286 the guys in the studio calling the signal would try to foul me up as best they could
4319287 and they did it fairly often and id have to say oh im sorry
4319288 i acted like i was just talking to one child and that made it work i was raising my 5 year old daughter at the time so it was easy for me we never talked down to the kids we treated them like little adults
4319289 im trying to use all the tools available to the township

4319299 hes going to be around par every time he goes out and today he was a little better than that chris came in with another good round and we got solid scores out of junior and chuck
4319300 we played pretty solid on monday but we had some mental mistakes and threw some shots away
4319301 we havent been doing those things the last two days
4319302 we played a lot better than our score on monday but weve done a much better job of getting rid of the mental mistakes that hurt us at the big cat were managing the course better in our last two tournaments and staying away from double bogeys
4319303 were still showing improvement but were not where id like to see us at
4319304 i think it helped us today to be at our own course
4319305 jarvis marmet really shined for us today he was paired with some of the better players and he really stepped up to the challenge im really excited to see that out of him because hes always had the talent to do that

4319316 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4319317 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4319318 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4319356 in the treatment of several kidney ailments and also chronic hypertension
4319357 theres a couple of things about him that make him more dangerous than the average we think first is absolute belief that hes done nothing wrong that victimizing children is not wrong and second is the fanaticism of his followers in the past
4319358 the injury done to children by sexual molestation is trivial
4319359 we cant analyze that man for real were just going by what we read and hear he might have a plan might have something to do with around here and it might not but who knows
4319360 at least monitor him at least somebody keep something on him that knows whats going on thats all were asking

4319391 collingwood sells newspapers if its collingwood its a mad frenzy its like a shark with a bit of blood in its nostrils
4319392 as proven anyone can beat anyone on a given day and thats the mindset that you have to have
4319393 does he do all the hard yakka and then finds himself handing the side over to another coach in 2011 that would be grossly unfair
4319394 last year was messy because of perhaps the people who were involved because of what was or what wasnt written in the contract and needed to be done at a certain date and was allowed to roll on
4319395 ive spoken to eugene and ive spoken to james club chairman brayshaw this week but my main concern is winning games of footy
4319396 we are not punching bags and we wont be taking any backward steps
4319397 we showed against st george that if thats the way the game goes we will adapt to it
4319398 theyre a team you have to pressure and we have to get up in their faces but within the guidelines
4319399 we dont want to lose it like st george did
4319400 we havent had any problems with the referees no more or no less than any other club
4319401 its just a bit of an excuse to try and justify what theyre doing
4319402 but weve got brett white michael crocker jeff lima dallas johnson those guys arent going to take a backward step to anyone

4319440 these numbers represent the hard work of students learning and teachers teaching in our state
4319441 while we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency this years gains are particularly encouraging considering they build upon five years of steady growth
4319442 no question the teachers are working very hard but we have got to change this
4319443 we cannot keep doing the same things and expecting better results
4319444 it makes you wonder and is a cause for concern
4319445 it may be an anomaly but that is something we want to look into
4319446 we want to identify these pockets of success and increase upon them
4319447 while we should applaud todays results this is hardly the finish line
4319448 any progress is good progress but overall performance remains too low improvement is too slow and achievement gaps remain far too wide
4319449 we have intelligence inputs about extremist groups planning to target prominent leaders and symbols of national importance

4319467 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4319468 whats my contingency plan for scaring up cash in a hurry if i lost the house in a hurricane and the insurance company was playing hardball or if the only surgeon who could save my life werent in my hmo network
4319469 whats an appropriate draw down rate what about inflation how do i budget for inevidable medical costs

4319472 you better call him hes in fall out boy you better call him
4319473 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4319474 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4319475 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4319476 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4319477 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4319478 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4319479 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4319480 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4319483 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4319484 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4319485 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4319486 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4319487 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4319488 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution

4319510 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4319511 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4319512 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4319513 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk

4319530 they kept asking isnt a lot of crap going to get in

4319556 this result severely restricts the freedom of the media in covering the conflict when journalists are fired at by the soldiers to kill people virtually without ascertaining whether or not they are opening fire on journalists

4319558 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
4319559 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
4319560 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
4319561 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections
4319562 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
4319563 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
4319564 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing
4319565 the hardest thing for me is doctors still arent really sure how to treat sarcoidosis symptoms
4319566 theres a lot of research on what to do for other diseases but not for this one so it can be hard to get the proper treatment
4319567 whos bbc radio 1 show did the mission record their first ever session for

4319571 the majority of our community here are kashmiri we have never had any problems and have a very good relationship with the kashmiri community and have done so for a very long time
4319572 this has had no effect on the airport it is a total police operation and we didnt even know that it had happened until afterwards
4319573 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4319574 buying a lap dance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4319575 many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lap dancing clubs as cafes
4319576 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq

4319582 the signing of the guaranteed maximum price signifies the end of the cost increases that we have endured during the life of the project
4319583 with the guaranteed maximum price in hand we will no longer be reliant on cost estimates that did not take into account the 2 1 2 years of delays caused by deliberation and approvals by agencies
4319584 the guaranteed maximum price is a very conservative number and i believe that it is well supported by contingencies if anything as the project goes forward we can look to see the possibility of the 195 3 million number coming down i do not expect it to exceed 195 million
4319585 it was frustrating and embarrassing to watch the cost rise without having a guaranteed maximum price
4319586 it showed that no one had any control over the project
4319587 one should not commit to purchasing something until one knows the price
4319588 we should have had a price in place before we committed to the project
4319589 so many in the city were saying to us back in february dont continue the foundation until there is a guaranteed maximum price had we taken those suggestions we would have found that this project would have been far more expensive and far more delayed and we would have never reached the state we have today
4319590 i think this is good news for the city and i think it is good news for the project we will have a school that will serve the city for many many years and it will be a project we will be proud of
4319591 today the tide has turned and newton north is moving forward
4319592 now is the time to visualize what this facility will mean to our community for this generation and generations to follow
4319593 the program is strictly for the elementary schools in this area
4319594 its pretty much extra money for families that want to attend the program
4319595 the jcpenney afterschool fund is firmly committed to supporting youth serving organizations like the ymca that are dedicated to providing safe meaningful programs during the crucial hours of 3 to 6 p m
4319596 by combining resources we can help reduce the number of unserved youth and ensure that students of all backgrounds and income levels are able to benefit from after school programs
4319597 the grant goes into a effect on sept 3 people can begin registering now
4319598 theres an application for financial assistance that we recommend everyone fill out and then we can figure out what we can give to families
4319599 its from 7 30 a m until the start of the school day

4319601 we are sorry for the obvious inconvenience to passengers and airlines and are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible
4319602 one of the conditions that came out worst was osteoarthritis where we asked people if theyd received basic advice such as doing exercises to control the condition and whether they had effective pain relief
4319603 at the more severe end of the scale for those with severe osteoarthritis we asked if they had been given the opportunity to see a specialist to talk about joint replacement
4319604 there were also issues around whether elderly patients had been asked the reason for their falls these types of areas did not fare so well in the study
4319605 drivers who kill through carelessness will no longer be able to walk away from court with just a fine

4319615 ebadi told the reformist kargozaran newspaper that she believed the allegation against her daughter had to do with her decision to defend seven bahais arrested on charges of having contact with irans arch foe israel
4319616 i am proud to say that my family and i are shiites
4319617 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
4319618 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
4319619 the captors blind folded him and thrashed him with metal cables until he passed out then rubbed salt into the wounds to wake him up so they could torture him more beat his testicles and kicked his teeth out they held his face down in a pool of excrement until he inhaled it they tied his arms behind his back and hung him from the ceiling at other times strapping him to a chair they kept him awake night after night he was played recordings of what he was told was his mother being tortured
4319620 these albums were made with a dual purpose in mind the first purpose is to be played at any core activity or any other event as a devotional tool the second purpose is for the listener to become familiar with the prayers and eventually sing them in private or in public with others

4319647 the key is exercising the body vigorously and keeping the mind active
4319648 it has elasticity whatever you do has a chance of rewiring the brain
4319649 if you keep the mind active at least you have a fighting shot

4319651 you are not a victim that cannot take action with hope you fight to maintain your independence right now i am doing everything ive ever done except drive at night i do have symptoms but they dont stop me
4319652 as with our muscles we can strengthen our neural pathways with brain exercise
4319653 or we can let them wither the principle is the same use it or lose it
4319654 this article confirmed that i could spread the word to people to exercise as much as they can

4319657 spark the revolutionary new science of exercise and the brain
4319658 physical activity sparks biological changes that encourage brain cells to bind to one another for the brain to learn these connections must be made the more neuroscientists discover about this process the clearer it becomes that exercise provides an unparalleled stimulus creating an environment in which the brain is ready willing and able to learn
4319659 exercise is the single most powerful tool you have to optimize your brain function
4319660 i cant understate how important regular exercise is in improving the function and performance of the brain

4319684 i think wednesday the last day of two a day was probably the hump day for them we had a lot better practice today a little more intensity and enthusiasm and more guys playing with the kind of intensity wed like to see out there on a day to day basis i think we made some improvement
4319685 ive been pleased with the way weve progressed offensively we are throwing and catching the ball fairly well and senior quarterback john parker wilson is having a good camp so far his leadership has been a real positive so far in the development of our offensive team
4319686 i think the biggest thing with our young players is they need to be able stay focused on the process of what they need to do to be complete players at their position
4319687 were kind of happy to be out of two a days ourselves although the way the schedule is now you really only have four two a days i am pleased and happy with the way we went through it and weve been able to stay fairly healthy knock on wood and hopefully we can continue to do that and continue to improve as a team and practice smart so that were able to do that were making progress weve got a lot of work to do but were not disappointed with where we are and were anxious to continue to the make the improvements we need to make to become a good football team

4319694 important as that victory was its just a step toward answering the key question how can we really implement guaranteed health care for all the only realistic answer a system of publicly funded privately delivered health care also known as single payer exists in legislative form rep john conyers bill h r 676 which has 90 co sponsors in the house
4319695 so while continuing to encourage democratic national convention delegates to become signers of the guaranteed health care for all statement today pda is starting a renewed push for the healthcare not warfare petition promoting h r 676 and serving as an important tool to organize on behalf of single payer nationwide

4319715 there is no happier place than the intersection of gods will and your giftedness
4319716 nicole is in complete denial and oblivious to how sick she really is
4319717 that really bothers me because there are people who truly have eating disorders and it is a serious disease to put that title on someone when it is not true is disrespectful ive repeatedly said no i dont have an eating disorder and it has fallen on deaf ears
4319718 it is important to nicole that she achieves this goal in a healthy way as this is not a treatment for an eating disorder
4319719 i was lik e a trash can i took everything
4319720 i can remember the first time i tried it as a teenager there was a lot of vomiting but your body becomes physically dependent on it right away
4319721 yes she did go see her therapist but she is sober sobriety is an ongoing process she is not in rehab and is home in glendale
4319722 nicole richie apparently not in rehab just hiding in glendale
4319723 thats pretty funny i mean we havent seen nicole out amp about recently amp we automatically assume the girls in rehab now thats what i call a bad reputation
4319724 a lot of investors who have been buying commodities not just on a global growth story but as a hedge against a weak dollar are unloading those commodities based on a much more constrained global outlook and going back into the u s dollar
4319725 well have some people targeting 750 but i think we would need to see a continuation in that dollar strength to give it sufficient momentum to head that way
4319726 history shows a strong and consistent correlation between weak currencies and falling stock markets
4319727 weak currencies are a symptom of a deeper problem slowing economic growth out of control inflation or structural issues that reduce the attractiveness of equities
4319728 c word and the hayseed have been following me all day
4319729 one of the things were going to do is im going to ask identical questions to both candidates which will be different
4319730 im not going to play gotcha with one candidate and not with the other this way it will be totally fair you compare apples to apples
4319731 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4319732 im called as a pastor to shepherd all the flock and i have in my church democrats and republicans and liberals and conservatives and moderates and everybody in between
4319733 and my calling is to shepherd all those people so i dont think its appropriate for pastors to endorse
4319734 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their world view and they want to hear it out
4319735 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4319736 of course things dont appear perfectly designed right now but thats because of the fall once adam sinned the design became marred or obscured by evil
4319737 you want me to believe an argument based on the appearance of design yet claim that the design actually is not apparent but will be at some point in the future that kind of argument appeals not to reason but to a leap of faith into invisible data its not rational its purely religious
4319738 the sikkim cms support could have worked as a balm
4319739 it was a small issue which could have been solved through talks instead of going to the court
4319740 the misunderstanding over the frequent blockades on nh31a could have been easily resolved through talks however the issue has taken another proportion after op bhandari filed the pil in the supreme court this could have been sorted out amicably through talks
4319741 we could have sorted this out between ourselves we could have even provided protection to sikkim vehicles during the bandhs from rangpo to sevoke now if any anti social groups take advantage of the situation and any untoward incidents happen during the bandhs and the highway is kept open for sikkim vehicles who will take the responsibility
4319742 sikkim and darjeeling are like the teesta and the rangit we have close social cultural and emotional ties with sikkim more than anything else the gorkhaland statehood demand is a fight for our own identity the gorkhaland movement is not for money it is about our pride and our identity and this gorkha identity is not only for the people of gorkhaland but also for the identity of gorkhas residing in sikkim as well
4319743 we do not want to behave badly with sikkim or spoil our relations we are grateful to sikkim and its people for the love and support they have given us during the gorkhaland agitation in the 1980s we are forever indebted to sikkim and the then chief minister nar bahadur bhandari for supporting us giving us and food and shelter during the 40 days strike in 1986 but we have to understand what is happening between sikkim and darjeeling right now
4319744 we have to analyse where we are going wrong in my opinion we have not done anything wrong to sikkim we have no hard feelings towards sikkim we have no intentions of putting sikkim in any kind of difficult situations or problems we do not want the people of sikkim to die of hunger we feel sikkims pain and we know that sikkim feels ours we have emotional ties with the people of sikkim but the way sikkim is moving now with a narrow outlook it should not happen
4319745 we have not gone and agitated on sikkims roads the fact is that nh31a falls within the proposed gorkhaland area we are compelled to keep the nh31a closed during our bandh calls
4319746 the highway is part of the proposed gorkhaland state it will automatically get affected whenever there is a bandh in the hills we have no control over that the sikkim government should understand that it is part of our fight and our movement there was no need to go to the court we do not want to unnecessarily put sikkim in any kind of hardship
4319747 the signature campaign is part of our efforts to garner support for the gorkhaland demand
4319748 i was told of the blockade at around 6 pm the blockade was lifted after i spoke to the sp in gangtok we will take disciplinary action against those who staged the blockade without our knowledge
4319749 respected the sikkim cm and his leadership and his vision
4319750 the cm had said in 2004 that he was willing to pass a resolution in the sikkim assembly in support of the gorkhaland demand this year alone we send our delegations to gangtok thrice to meet the cm in this regard but all efforts to meet him was in vain
4319751 all we expect from the sikkim cm is to speak a few words in support of gorkhaland demand our ties cannot be overlooked if the cm speaks in our favour it will act as a balm it is a great morale booster when your own people lend some support
4319752 the major exporting destinations of our bulk tea are japan germany france middle east united states and united kingdom where we have our definite set of buyers our beverage company believes in promoting sound quality darjeeling and assam orthodox tea to the world
4319753 we are targeting the beverage market of sri lanka we have exported orthodox tea in sri lanka when there has been scarcity of orthodox tea in the global market exporting good quality beverage has been the focus of our organisation and it will remain in the coming years we do not have any such plans to enter the domestic beverage market our organisation has also made inroads into the russian market where the consumption of best quality tea is limited
4319754 there are fair chances of scaling up the tea production if we are abreast of the latest developments happening in the tea industry of the world the beverage exporter has recorded an annual turnover of rs 22 crore from its exports in the last fiscal and is looking at a turnover of rs 30 crore in the current fiscal

4319766 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4319767 information we get in real time is preliminary and may be subject to change when we get a fuller account of what happened
4319768 we didnt have any real reason to go back and question what we were told initially nobody called us to question that
4319769 there are many situations in which a pilot declares an emergency and in the vast majority of cases the pilot lands the plane safely
4319770 declaring an emergency gives that aircraft priority and ensures there is rescue equipment available in case there is a real problem

4319775 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations
4319776 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azerbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

4319823 what im seeing in jeff hes not going out of the strike zone like weve seen when he knew hes the one we have to count on
4319824 a big part of getting your pitch is whos protecting you jeff feels responsible whether hes naked or surrounded by manny im just giving my perspective its been a benefit to the two guys who back to back have been a force in this game
4319825 when it was barry and i we absolutely couldnt have done it without the people ahead of us and those picking up in back
4319826 thats why i believe in a group of guys its better to have run producers behind a bunch of guys who can get on base a group of guys getting on base are more valuable than relying on one or two or three guys its true that hitters feed off each other
4319827 personally id rather bat deeper in the order manny could bat third because you want your best hitter batting in the first inning its only a few games but with manny were absolutely improved we havent had a player like manny here whether he can sustain it well see as long as he can we havent had an addition like that before

4319938 at the moment the champions trophy is still going ahead so we can only plan as if that is going to happen the ideal situation wont be that we go to darwin for one dayers then home for two and a half weeks then go to india we will certainly have some other things on the go

4319954 everybody was expecting them to win including them and when they called out our names instead it was perfect when we watched the video takes later on we saw them and their producer rolling their eyes and glaring when we won
4319955 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
4319956 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
4319957 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
4319958 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
4319959 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
4319960 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series
4319961 in our letter dated 10 august we made a commitment to the meat industry action group miag to hold a special general meeting which would be called irrespective of the outcome of the vote on the pgw partnership proposal therefore the time resources and money that miag will cause silver fern farms to waste on court action defies belief
4319962 about fifty meetings with shareholders throughout this whole process so you cant really accuse them of not consulting
4319963 on approval of that transaction the new board would hear the issues raised at that special general meeting based on miags issues we have a firm option on the table to be voted on whereas miag requirements are about a process as opposed to a concrete transaction
4319964 it is likely that history would record miag by its actions in destabilising the governance of both companies has in itself been the cause of slowing the progress of industry consolidation

4319969 in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well any more it is becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4319970 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4319971 governing is more than not just being defeated in the house its also being able to pass legislation
4319972 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4319973 human error continues to compound the governments data loss issues
4319974 it is clear that data protection technology is moving faster than human procedure for years data protection has been about more than simply safeguarding valuable information from competitors the rise of terrorism and identity theft has rendered it a matter of national security
4319975 businesses and public sector bodies alike must start viewing on going staff training in data protection as essential to the wider business continuity strategy
4319976 a proactive and considered approach to data management will help to prevent data loss the cost of which is measured not only financially but also in terms of the damage that can be caused to an organisations reputation
