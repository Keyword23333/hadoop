3610012 the investigation so far has been able to trace the movements of the deceased until about 5 30pm aest on saturday when they were seen at the soldiers club in batemans bay
3610013 after that we dont see or hear from them again until their bodies are discovered at 9 30pm on sunday
3610014 that shortened the time a little bit but we are still interested in any information people may have about their movements or anyone seen near their home between those two times
3610015 i think that is the hardest part for me is that somebody actually did this and then ran from the scene
3610016 why would you ever do that to another human being

3610027 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual online casinos award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a online casinos project
3610028 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
3610029 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our online casinos industry can benefit from this special night
3610030 i know the academy of online casinos design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
3610031 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he online casinos industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
3610032 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a online casinos industry demonstrate to the general public

3610040 det er klart at faldende priser p traditionelle energikilder mindsker gevinsten ved at investere i at udvikle nye alternative energikilder p den korte bane
3610041 det vi oplever i jeblikket er at den lavkonjunktur der er sat ind d mper eftersp rgslen efter olie og andre fossile br ndstoffer og at det har f et prisen til at falde
3610042 vi kan godt afbl se nogle af de dommedagsprofetier der har v ret om at nu skulle olieprisen op i 250 dollar vi har nu n et et punkt hvor vi ser nogle af de stabiliserende faktorer tr de ind i forhold til olieprisen
3610043 vi vil mene at man kan godt tillade sig at l gge en relativt h j oliepris p denne her side af de 100 dollar til grund for sine investeringer
3610044 hvis olieprisen forts tter med at falde vil tilliden til markedet for vedvarende energiteknologi blive sv kket
3610045 jeg tror det voldsomme fald vi oplever lige nu blot er udtryk for en midlertidig krusning
3610046 jeg meldte mig ind hos de radikale inden uffe blev formand for venstre havde han v ret formand dengang alts uffe som han var i de dage ikke som han er i dag hvor jeg slet ikke kan genkende ham s havde jeg m ske ogs v ret med der
3610047 jeg er jo f dt ind i det radikale venstre og min far var folketingsmedlem for partiet faktisk i den periode hvor der var vkr regering s det l jo lige for at det var der jeg skulle v re med jeg meldte mig ogs ind i en periode hvor de fortsat l i den midterposition hvor de kunne presse deres politik i gennem det har ndret sig
3610048 jeg synes ikke vi har ndret holdninger naser st r stadig for det som gav ham problemer i det radikale venstre og for mit vedkommende var jeg med til at f en r kke liberale reformid er gjort til radikal politik f eks en dagpengereform og en skattereform med lavere skat p den sidst tjente krone her foreslog vi endda at fjerne fradragsretten for fagforeningskontingentet
3610049 man udvikler sig jo men jeg blev allerede liberal mens jeg gik p polit studiet i samme periode arbejdede jeg ogs som tolk med flygtninge og indvandrere og der gik det virkelig op for mig at man klientgjorde dem der kom hertil man var ikke i stand til at give hj lp til selvhj lp de blev behandlet som stakkels ofre der ikke kunne klare sig lige fra jeg begyndte som debatt r har jeg st et for retten til at bestemme over sit eget liv krop arbejde uddannelse seksualitet o s v det er det jeg forst r ved at v re liberal det har bare v ret sv rt i ny alliance vi begyndte jo som et kompromis en blanding af socialliberale og socialkonservative og det skabte total forvirring var anders og jeg begyndt alene s tror jeg at vi var begyndt nogenlunde her hvor vi st r i dag
3610050 ja det vi s ville have st et for og som pressen helt automatisk ville have vidst at vi stod for det ville p den ene side have v ret behovet for en skattereform og reformer i det hele taget styr p den offentlige sektor og et faldende skattetryk og p den anden side kampen mod ekstremisme kampen for en ordentlig integration fokus p hvem der kommer ind i landet aktualiteten af det sidste ser vi i disse dage hvor debatten om ef domstolen viser at strategien med at k re med halv bne gr nser og helt bne kasser ikke dur i en globaliseret verden her bliver vi n dt til at erkende at gr nserne ikke kan lukkes hermetisk men til geng ld kan vi lukke kasserne
3610051 jo og det var ogs noget som vi var en del af dengang
3610052 men det er s ikke noget som de har valgt at forf lge de har lagt v gten et helt andet sted i udl ndingpolitikken i forargelsessporet og dansk folkeparti og alt det der det var jo ogs det der gjorde at der var s meget fokus p hvad naser sagde han sagde jo tingene p en helt anden m de
3610053 ja da det skulle konkretiseres med de bne gr nser og lukkede kasser i det radikale venstre s var vi tilbage ved det gamle i ny alliance fors ger vi at holde fast i at l sningen p mange af problemerne ogs det aktuelle er at acceptere at gr nserne ikke kan lukkes fuldst ndig men vi kan lukke for kasserne tanken er at n r folk kommer hertil og f r opholdstilladelse s skal de have en aftale med en virksomhed og den virksomhed skal s s rge for at de bliver forsikrede mod de behov i tilv relsen som vi andre f r d kket af det offentlige
3610054 det havde ogs v ret en ny alliance hvis vi som det s ud en uge inde i valgkampen havde form et at skabe et flertal mellem venstre de konservative ny alliance og de radikale s havde der v ret en mulighed for at ndre p det forhold at det i dag er stilstandsv lgerne som afg r hvor magten ligger der skete jo et skifte da dansk folkeparti blev det parti der kunne tr kke v lgere hen over midten i stedet for det radikale venstre som l ste sig til socialdemokraterne og derfor ikke l ngere kunne g re det det var der det blev interessant at tale til stilstandsv lgerne og det er derfor at man ikke har turdet at lave en reform siden som har v ret bare tiln rmelsesvis interessant hvis vi havde kunnet tiltr kke de reformorienterede liberale v lgere fra venstre s ville der pludselig ikke v re 90 mandater p hverken den ene eller den anden side og s ville man ikke kunne komme udenom ny alliance men de v lgere straffede os retf rdigt eller ikke retf rdigt for ikke at v re klare i spyttet derfor har vko stadig flertal og derfor f res der stadig stilstandspolitik i danmark det har vi l rt af
3610055 der er ting som skal pr ciseres og justeres og nogen af de ting som blev taget med for at alle kunne f le sig hjemme skal v k det er en proces vi g r i gang med
3610056 der er nogen ting vores trafikpolitik er f eks totalt r d hehe det skal v k og der skal formuleres en ny trafikpolitik
3610057 differentieret moms er ogs et sted hvor man m sp rge om det er det rigtige sted at tage kampen n r det kommer til stykket vi var jo ude i en balancegang som var en konsekvens af at vi valgte ikke at starte alene men at starte tre nu er vi s inde i den modsatte bev gelse af venstre som oprindeligt havde et liberalt program men efterh nden har f et et socialdemokratisk program vi bev ger os v k fra det som blev en eller anden form for kompromis og hen til det som vi oprindeligt stod for
3610058 hvorfor kigger vi ikke p vores sundhedssystem i det hele taget og sp rger os selv n r vi var nummer et i starten af 70erne i europa og n r vi i dag er blevet overhalet af portugiserne kan det s v re at den hellige danske model har spillet fallit
3610059 sagen er at vi s rgede for at svare nogenlunde ens p de sp rgsm l med udgangspunkt i partiprogrammet som var et kompromis det kunne jo ikke nytte noget at is r partistifterne svarede i forskellige retninger men det er nu et af de elementer som vi vil g ind og kigge p og som vi h ber at s mange som muligt vil bidrage til
3610060 nu starter vi en proces der er mange ting vi skal diskutere f eks vores holdning til fri hash aktiv d dshj lp prostitution og der vil vi gerne have at liberale mennesker melder sig ind og pr ger politikudviklingen p de omr der
3610061 vi er et rs tid henne i en meget meget turbulent proces og det vi pr ver at sige til alle liberale nu hvor vi har v ret igennem en renselsesproces er kom nu v r med til at fyre argumenterne af v r med til at pr ge det nye politiske program i stedet for at st ude p sidelinjen kom ind og v r en del af det det er ikke alt vi er afklarede med s man kan komme ind og p virke politikformuleringen
3610062 jamen det er fuldst ndig rigtigt der er meget som h rer til i fortiden siden da er jeg ogs blevet erkl ret som superliberal af statsministeren s nu bliver jeg n dt til at give plads til ultraliberale nej det var jo udtryk for at der var nogen enorme sp ndinger lige fra starten
3610063 det blev sagt flere gange jeg er ikke kommet her for at v re med i et liberalt projekt
3610064 ja det var der en af de tre rundt om bordet der sagde tit og jeg var nok den der p det tidspunkt havde det st rste behov for at fors ge at holde sammen p det hele s derfor kom jeg med s dan nogen forsager du dj vlen agtige udsagn selvom jeg mente det var h bl st at g re det fordi det s ikke blev et samlingsprojekt
3610065 vi er liberale og det vil vi holde fast i men derfor kan der ogs v re plads til ekstremt liberale og ultraliberale eller hvad de nu bliver kaldt eller kalder sig selv nogen liberale har synspunkter som jeg ikke deler og m ske ligefrem har det sv rt med der var f eks et forslag engang om at folk p overf rselsindkomst skulle fratages stemmeretten og det kommer jeg aldrig til at st for andre mener at ulandsbistanden udelukkende skal v re privat finansieret og det er jeg ogs helt uenig i men der er plads til folk med de synspunkter i ny alliance

3610087 the exchange of territories including bakassi peninsula under the auspices of the united nations will happen on thursday across the country
3610088 i am aware that the federal government last week formally sought and obtained the certified true copy of justice adahs ruling which had stated in part from the further affidavits of the plaintiffs it is clear that there was a dispute over the boundaries between nigeria and cameroun and the international court of justice icj delivered judgment dated 10th october 2002 the part of the territories these plaintiffs have brought before this court was involved in the area litigated upon at the icj since the issue had been determined at that level the decision binds all sovereign states that are members of the united nations and no forum domesticum of member states can assume jurisdiction to review what has been decided by the icj
3610089 as painful as it is for everyone including the president it is a commitment we have made to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it what has been of concern to the president and will be a priority to him is the welfare of the people of bakassi as bona fide citizens of nigeria who have found themselves in a territory legally given to another country and i can assure you that efforts have been made to ensure their comfort
3610090 the people of bakassi are suffering as human beings wherever they belong to in the two countries they remain africans and they are entitled to good welfare that is our concern so we call on the governments of both nigeria and the republic of cameroun to ensure that they are treated like human beings and not second class citizens
3610091 within the last one month the president has effectively tackled the problem of systems collapse which has gone on for years that required political intervention but i wont go into details
3610092 has also sorted out the issue of funding for the short term with the governors and once the monies are duly appropriated in the state houses of assembly and by the national assembly everything will be in place the strategies for the long term are also in place
3610093 are now beginning to realise the resolve of the president because once the emergency is declared in the power sector there will be stiff sanctions if they fail to meet their obligations and all these will be clearly spelt out as pre conditions for continued operations in our country

3610131 this year there was an exceptional amount of ice according to expedition leader prof gerhard kattner the extent reached from the high north southward to 74 degrees latitude the main objective of the research cruise was to check 17 moorings with instruments that monitor temperature salinity and currents of the water masses awi has been carrying out these unique high latitude investigations since 1999 observed 2008 temperatures are slightly lower than 2006 measurements and there are preliminary indications of a return of the pacific water mass signature which has been absent since 2004
3610132 for this purpose we had to move last year the devices embodied at the bottom of the sea further northward in order to follow the retreating ice and guarantee that they at least temporarily stood in the sphere of influence of the edge of ice

3610279 there has been some outrageous nonsense which has suggested this trip is a front for a gun running operation one of the things that we will be doing before sailing is to invite the cypriot authorities on board to give us a clean bill of health the accusations would be hilarious if the consequences were not so serious

3610281 what i do know is that you cannot swing a cat in cyprus at the moment without bumping into some dodgy looking characters that look as though theyve come straight from the pen of ian fleming
3610282 is that there certainly is a lot of unwelcome interest in this operation which is why certain aspects were shrouded in secrecy

3610348 es una mentira m s del gobernador precioso pareciera que el mandatario se gast el dinero en su imagen personal que hemos visto en los medios de comunicaci n
3610349 en la reuni n tambi n vamos a definir cu ntas patrullas vamos a comprar este a o porque necesitamos reforzar el equipamiento de seguridad p blica nosotros cada a o hemos comprado patrullas y se va a hacer una evaluaci n de las unidades para definir cu ntas necesitamos

3610352 de directie gaat akkoord om een significant aantal nieuwe mensen in dienst te nemen en om een aantal tijdelijke of deeltijdse contracten om te zetten in vaste en voltijdse bovendien komt er een ombudsdienst waar het personeel terecht kan met zijn grieven en wordt er een ploeg van een viertal arbeiders voorzien die kan ingezet worden als er een tekort aan mensen is
3610353 we hebben onze mensen uitgelegd dat we hiermee het onderste uit de kan hadden gehaald en dat we voldoende garanties hadden gekregen dat de directie de afspraken zou naleven zo komt er snel een evaluatie met de directie op de luchthaven zelf en later een met de sociaal bemiddelaar het personeel heeft onze uitleg aanvaard an de aanwezige ploegen zijn onmiddellijk aan het werk gegaan
3610354 arbeiders daarentegen zitten al bijna terug in de tijd van daens
3610355 wie poets er hier als je het ons laat doen dan doen wij het met 2 mensen minder in minder tijd en voor minder geld
3610356 dit kan op tien minuten opgelost zijn als de directie ingaat op de eisen van het personeel
3610357 study citizen soldiers at higher risk for new drinking problems
3610358 i hate seeing someone being bullied and as strange as it might sound with tony i felt specially early on he was being bullied
3610359 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3610360 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3610361 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3610362 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3610363 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3610364 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but other things that are not
3610365 but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3610366 le prix des mati res premi res en tr s forte augmentation
3610367 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up

3610370 let us be very clear resolution no 10 has no intention whatsoever to extend her term or my term or anybody elses term its only purpose is the adoption of the federal system of government

3610372 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3610373 we knew she had ability but because she is so young you never know how it is going to go

3610375 when i gave the trophy i hoped it would help create a competition with an entirely new flavour at the club and this result has more than justified my optimism

3610377 i have an incredible amount of vintage that i ve collected over the years
3610378 the synergy with our existing range is clear we are offering our customers the complete ensemble look
3610379 there is a vast crowd of youngsters who prefer wearing jeans and t shirts they do not usually wear fabindia clothes and nor are they interested in home accessories we expect the jewellery to pull them to our stores the appeal of jewellery cuts across all segments
3610380 though we have eight stores in the gulf and a growing presence in the region at the moment we are not sending any jewellery out we will market it in phases as this is a new line of business for us we are trying to brand the unbranded
3610381 fuck you robyn youve got another day of being completely exhausted and useless ahead of you oh and i hate you
3610382 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3610383 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
3610384 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
3610385 the issue is whether the more sophisticated tools are doing the same things we used to do or are creating a different set of legal circumstances

3610415 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes

3610424 ingenomen te zijn met de voortgang die csm heeft geboekt in dit volatiele economische klimaat
3610425 in de huidige uitdagende omstandigheden moeten we realistisch zijn over het bereiken van de doelen die wij in 2005 hebben gesteld
3610426 deze omstandigheden beinvloeden ook de doelen voor het rendement op geinvesteerd kapitaal roce zij het in geringere mate wij blijven vastbesloten om een roce van ten minste 12 te realiseren voor csm als geheel
3610427 im in good form and for the moment everything is going well
3610428 i am very confident as far as my chances are concerned in taking the gold medal home
3610429 at least 640 arbitrary detentions of political dissidents have taken place so far this year
3610430 two years after certain rearrangements in the highest circles of government the situation of civil political and economic rights continues being very unfavorable
3610431 social repression is part of the daily life of the citizenry
3610432 the incessant perfecting of the structures and methods of repression its unlikely that the situation will improve at least in the short run
3610433 if it didnt happen in the past 3 hours its old news

3610435 him powell saying usain bolt has taken the pressure off him i dont buy into that too much
3610436 asafa powell had the world record usain bolt has the world record and that is something powell held close to him very dearly
3610437 i think he is under a little pressure to get the record back for himself his country his family and his friends i think he is also under a lot of pressure to win the gold medal and thats a fact
3610438 i would assume there is a lot of pressure on bolt regardless what anybody says the people in his country and in other countries are expecting him to come out with that gold medal
3610439 a lot of people are saying usain and tyson are very strong finishers but if i get out in front of them no matter how they are finishing they wont even close on me
3610440 i did some great things in practice for the past couple of weeks
3610441 this is the first time ive seen my coach so excited so all i have to do is go there and just be like i was in the last two races and i do it
3610442 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since i have been here they have tested me four times and took blood a lot of blood
3610443 they are taking so much blood we are going to be very weak before the finals of the 100 meters
3610444 and i am almost sure i might be tested tomorrow
3610445 i dont know about anybody else but they are really down on my case and my team mate michael frater and usain
3610446 with me and usain out there its a big thing in jamaica
3610447 they expect us to be first and second a world record and stuff like that

3610475 the new dispute process was a gift from heaven for canadas big business groups because it gives them a powerful new weapon for deregulation across the country
3610476 if a business doesnt like a certain environmental or public health measure that curbs their profits they can claim it represents a barrier to trade or investment and have their home province challenge local democracy and decision making through the ait dispute process as an added insult governments can now be punished for simply doing their jobs with fines as high as 5 million
3610477 already tilma is discouraging municipal governments from drafting policies favouring the purchase of locally grown food for fear that they will incur corporate challenges as barriers to inter provincial trade which is what the governments of saskatchewan and the yukon were afraid of and why they decided not to sign the agreement
3610478 it is completely unacceptable that the premiers would simply adopt this unnecessary dispute process into the ait without any public discussion or debate this agreement is a barrier to democracy

3610482 la derecha y tambi n algunos sectores del frente amplio fa aislaron el tema de las relaciones con eta a fin de condenar esas relaciones y el libro
3610483 es cierto que muchas veces no entendimos algunas l neas del accionar militar de eta no entendimos y a veces discrepamos abiertamente con algunas formas de empleo de la violencia revolucionaria nosotros tenemos una experiencia distinta cuidamos las reglas de una manera diferente relacionada con el entendimiento del pueblo

3610489 one addict for every two hundred and fifty citizens this not only gives vancouver the highest rate of drug addiction in the western hemisphere

3610491 it is just as easy to buy drugs at this hotel

3610498 if you were then selling your fish or bringing them onshore for process previously you couldnt claim that at all for any fuel that you used in that activity but now you can claim that at 19 cents
3610499 there has been good news and bad news in terms of access to abortion services in 2008 since the launch of reality check in april 2007 some hospitals have stopped performing abortions because providers have retired hospitals have merged or because hospitals have closed down leaving a void of services in the region some health professionals still think they have the right to give inaccurate information about pregnancy options in order to influence a womans decision just the other day staff at canadians for choice spoke to a young woman who found out she was pregnant and who went to a health clinic to ask information about abortion services the nurse at the clinic showed her a clothes hanger and told her that is what they would use on her to perform an abortion and she might bleed to death
3610500 ive always been pro choice but attending the 20th anniversary celebration in ottawa with fellow revolutionary feminists i realized how hard these activists worked to get the choice for us and i was inspired to work just as hard to keep our right so that their work isnt in vain
3610501 be it resolved that member locals of the cfs that refuse to allow anti choice organizations access to their resources and space be supported and further be it resolved that a pro choice organization kit be created that may include materials such as a fact sheet buttons contact information for local pro choice organizations and research on anti choice organizations and the conservative think tanks that fund them
3610502 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3610503 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3610504 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3610505 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3610506 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3610507 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3610508 it would be folly not to undertake a proper and thorough review of the states energy policy
3610509 weve been concerned for some time about a lack of diversity in supply and a need for a proper energy security policy in this state
3610510 the gas crisis has been one of the most significant challenges to face the wa business community and general community in many years
3610511 we estimate it will cost business at least 2 4 billion already but the final cost will be higher and is hard to estimate accurately
3610512 we believe though that the terms of reference for this review need to be broadened to include consideration that the contribution that all commercially viable energy sources can make in the future
3610513 were not just talking gas and coal but also renewables and the energy option that dares not speak its name nuclear
3610514 were not saying we should build a nuclear power station in wa
3610515 were saying we should have a rational and sensible debate
3610516 it might be a little much to ask from politicians who cant even deregulate shopping hours but we remain hopeful
3610517 it is a somewhat perverse position that penalties will in affect apply to the lng liquefied natural gas industry which right now is arguable making australias single most important contribution to limiting greenhouse emissions globally
3610518 exports to asia are actually replacing less greenhouse friendly fuels
3610519 any move in an ets that doesnt recognise the importance and enormous potential investment in that industry is a scheme which is flawed
3610520 the legal cases between oklahoma and arkansas evolved from a conflict over point source pollution involving municipal wastewater discharge to a conflict over nonpoint source pollution in the form of nutrient runoff from poultry litter
3610521 in light of three decades or more of significant structural changes in the animal agricultural production system this shift from point source to nonpoint source mirrors the evolution of how water quality has been addressed since the enactment of clean water act
3610522 discernable confined and discrete conveyances including any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well from which pollutants may be discharged
3610523 a consequence of these structural changes is that extraordinary amounts of animal waste are produced in geographically limited areas
3610524 this waste must be disposed of or utilized somehow and a traditional and common method is for producers to apply it to the land as fertilizer
3610525 policymakers may begin to consider new policy approaches to addressing nonpoint source pollution particularly if they conclude that addressing the issue through region based litigation may not be the most effective tool to address a national issue the thought might be that perhaps theres a better way to address these problems without litigation or overly burdensome government regulation
3610526 linking this approach with some type of comprehensive watershed management system may be a new paradigm in which policymakers can address nonpoint source pollution from agriculture

3610544 triveni engineering is a different stock i think it is not just sugar perhaps it has some other because it is outperforming and the impression i get is that it is ready for a new bull run so that is a stock that investors could actually go and buy in

3610774 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3610775 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3610776 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3610777 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3610778 aku sudah merasa cukup dengan hidup seperti ini mengapa pula harus mengambil resiko yang begitu besar hanya untuk mengejar keinginan duniawi yang belum tentu baik buatku
3610779 i dont think the land reform in south africa will have any impact on foreign investors we are following the same policy that we have been pursuing since the 1990s its not something new
3610780 there are views that the only people who can do farming are whites if they leave then agriculture will collapse this concern is also being expressed in some quarters in zimbabwe
3610781 in south africa we are working together with strategic partners who transfer skills to black farmers we are addressing equity fairness and justice
3610782 we have got enough space and room for everybody in the new south africa if we achieve the 30 percent target of transferring land to black people by 2014 70 percent of the land will still remain in the hands of white people i dont know why big issues are being made out of land reform
3610783 they wont stop at 30 percent our calculation is that whites will be left with closer to 50 percent of the land they currently own
3610784 if we go the zimbabwe way we may lose 15 000 farmers out of the total 46 000 commercial farmers by 2008 2010 these include black farmers who come to us complaining about their farms being targeted for acquisition
3610785 the pressure on commercial farmers to lose their land is becoming extensive
3610786 land reform took off slowly because we had to put the commission for land claims in place although management is now in place we still have basic challenges to address
3610787 its in the interest of national security that the 30 percent target be reached we need all the assistance that we can get from non governmental organisations and business
3610788 its in the interest of everybody that we address land reform
3610789 last week i spoke for three hours and lost my voice because people were complaining that their lands were taken and that we were doing nothing about it
3610790 sometimes we use the left hand to wave away guns pointed at us we say first listen to us and if you decide to shoot make sure that the bullet catches us for the right reason
3610791 the farmers told us that they didnt recognise the government of south africa but at the end of discussions they said they would cooperate with it
3610792 an average of two farmers and their workers are killed every week some 2 400 murders of farmers and their black workers have taken place since 1996 a third of those murdered are black workers
3610793 we have experience that when theres a claim on a farm then the level of murders goes up they kill and dont take anything from the farm from our point of view its an attack directed at white farmers and their workers to force them off land
3610794 i only experience small problems such as fixing defective water pumps and fences last year i harvested 5 038 tonnes of sugar cane this year im looking forward to harvesting more
3610795 i grew up in a farming family i like farming im also thinking of raising chickens so that when natural disasters like drought hit my sugarcane farm i have something to fall back on
3610796 when i raise enough money i want to buy 100 hectares of land
3610797 some 1 000 people applied for this farm only seven were selected to run it it was a run down farm we managed to turn it around
3610798 in zimbabwe perhaps 5 percent of the land went to those with political ties another 15 percent went to civil servants or others with jobs in the urban economy peasant farmers got about 80 percent of the land and they are doing much better than the rest this could be because they farm in more labour intensive ways and are less dependent on purchased inputs and fuel which have been in short supply because of wider economic problems
3610799 sure there have been failures particularly in the areas where highly capitalised farming had been taken over or where long nurtured market relationships have been undermined such as in the tobacco or horticulture sector getting these back on track will take time and resources but in other areas where small scale farmers have taken on land against all the odds including lack of credit poor infrastructure and recurrent drought many farmers with newly acquired land have been doing surprisingly well they have been investing in new homes growing herds of cattle and reaping substantial yields of crops in good rainfall years
3610800 this has undermined the establishment of new farming businesses particularly on the small scale commercial resettlements
3610801 those with lower input requirements and hooked into more localised exchange networks in the small scale farming resettlements have fared better but even so recent times have been very tough for everyone
3610802 there are many positive dimensions to the zimbabwean land reform and important lessons for the region including the real potential of small scale agriculture if it is given support there is also potential for a dynamic entrepreneurial local economy with new players emerging in the market
3610803 there are multiple examples of success in zimbabwe alongside the better documented examples of failure but success must be nurtured and supported and this will only come with sustained political and economic stability
3610804 it seems as if the households who have a legal claim on the land accept the non claimant families
3610805 this proves that there is a strong demand for land for homestead purposes these people are subsistence farmers who seem to be quite content the irony is that this is not the kind of outcome envisioned by government who is more focused on establishing commercial farmers even though munzhedzi is clearly working and there is a huge need for small plots subsistence farming is not an acceptable concept to government and as yet there is no help for people who want only a small piece of land
3610806 just after independence in 1990 a national land reform conference was held which lay the foundation for a peaceful land reform process
3610807 however the land reform process is taking place much too slowly for most people

3610814 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3610815 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3610816 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website

3611168 bis ende 2007 konnten wir unsere kapazit ten auf 2 mio basenpaare steigern und damit in den letzten zwei jahren mehr als vervierfachen f r den n chsten quantensprung heben wir derzeit die technologie die software aber auch die von uns installierten prozesse auf ein v llig neues level dazu investieren wir gezielt in die entwicklung neuer automatisierungs und prozesstechnologien und haben so die weichen f r den weiteren kapazit tsausbau auf 5 mio basenpaare bis ende 2009 und auf 10 mio basenpaare bis ende 2010 gestellt

3611189 with the successful 1st half of 2008 we are on the right track to meeting our prognoses for the entire year the large nih order has greatly influenced the net sales and earnings in 2007 however fast growing business activities and nih follow up orders have by and large already compensated for the completion of the first large nih order by the end of 2007 through the rest of 2008 we expect to continue profiting from the currently completed preparations of our capacity increases
3611190 we are ready for the next step at the end of 2007 we had increased our capacities to 2m base pairs per month that means our capacities more than quadrupled in the past two years for the next quantum leap we are now advancing our technology the software and also our proprietary processes to entirely new levels therefore we systematically invest in new automation and process technologies thus creating the prerequisites for further capacity expansions to 5m base pairs per month by the end of 2009 and to 10m by the end of 2010
3611191 one thing is for sure we have to do better than what weve been doing
3611192 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3611193 what we are seeing are youngsters a community that is in revolt because they dont like they way they are being treated

3611204 this will probably put us back in a worst case scenario about 90 days from where we would have been
3611205 the needs that were evident in the first set of tax hearings and the reasons we were requesting the tax havent changed and wont change
3611206 we could give it all to flood mitigation in any given year if the circumstances were necessary
3611207 you know the state of ohio is not the only area that doesnt make a lot of sense when you read statutes but thats what were dealing with
3611208 if they want to pass a three quarters of a percent sales tax and say its specifically for flood mitigation im all for it
3611209 but when they pass this open ended thing with no specificity for what its issued for i dont think thats responsible

3611228 with its four white columns and ornate detail the hurlbut mansion is one of lewistons oldest buildings
3611229 it towers over the lewis clark early childhood campus it has more value than most people recognize just driving by and looking at it
3611230 initially people understand that our intention was to tear it down because that was the most expeditious route to solving the issue of what to do with it
3611231 since that time however we have done more research into the value of the building its history the architect who designed it built it and have concluded that there really is value in the building itself
3611232 imagine a use for the building that benefits our program and benefits the community it really becomes a resource to the community in many different ways

3611278 we will do for business consulting what saas has done for technology
3611279 in the same way that firms cannot wait around for 18 months and dont want to pay armies of it consultants and technicians to implement traditional software they want a quick payback from their business consulting programmes as well we aim to help them transform their business which has a rapid impact on the bottom line

3611281 throwing technology at a problem will not work unless you can manage the change required to implement it across the organisation these changes will impact on a companys ethos beliefs and values and if not carried out correctly will actually have an adverse effect on performance and numbers

3611287 i am delighted with my performance in what is one of the most challenging races i have ever participated in during the winter my friend bob hobby a fellow sailing enthusiast and editor of the on line sailing publication www sail ie and i gave my boat dinah a complete refit everything inside was rebuilt to make her lighter stronger and faster fortunately the preparation really paid off during the race the storms were appalling especially on the second leg i had everything thrown at me with winds blowing over 40 knots but dinah stood up incredibly well conditions were so bad in fact that more than half the entrants did not complete the course
3611288 at one point yoda from star wars was sitting at the bow of the boat giving me directions
3611289 during the trip i had many high and lows the lowest point was when i had to drop all the sails during a massive storm in the bay of biscay and lost my autopilot remote control over the side of the boat however leading the fleet 24 hours into the last leg ahead of much bigger and more powerful boats was exhilarating and more than made up for the earlier problems

3611291 while the demand for property may be on a downward slope the ubiquitous war for talent shows no signs of dissipating in fact in 2008 a large number of baby boomers will retire and recent reports have suggested that there will not be enough graduates with the right skills coming into the market to act as replacements
3611292 pushed the envelope of what is possible in mobile application
3611293 with wmobile we have been able to fulfill a need for our small to mid size customers to mobilize their crm processes the product sales cycle is very short because wmobile is inexpensive and provides great value and implementation is quick and easy i use wmobile to access my goldmine daily so its a pleasure to endorse and sell a product that i really believe in
3611294 our simple installation procedures and a low 295 per user license cost means that wmobile is one of very few mobile crm products on the market that supports as little as two users and has been proven to scale up for larger organizations with hundreds of users wmobile 1 8 demonstrates our continued commitment to making mobile crm even more integrated into the day to day business processes

3611341 coupling a peripheral canal the least expensive option with investment in the delta ecosystem can promote both environmental sustainability and a reliable water supply
3611342 the belief has been that were defending the environment by maintaining the freshwater system but that is actually incompatible with giving the deltas native species and ecosystem a fighting chance to survive and prosper
3611343 neither the ppic report authors nor officials with the state have done a full scale economic analysis of how a change in water quality with the operation of a peripheral canal would impact farming recreation or fisheries
3611344 it is estimated that delta farming alone contributes 2 billion per year to our local economy and recreation like boating and fishing another 750 million if the delta is made into a salty inland sea the economic impacts will be devastating to those living in the surrounding five counties of the delta
3611345 finding the balance a vision for water supply and environmental reliability in california
3611346 a vicious cycle of water shortages and environmental near disasters and instead create a stable and reliable water supply
3611347 our water supplies will remain vulnerable as long as we allow the environment to remain at the brink of disaster
3611348 for decades water users have sought to pump additional water out of our central valley streams then species have declined and ultimately the courts are forced to step in to prevent an environmental catastrophe
3611349 we have a great opportunity right now to create a reliable water supply for future generations of californians and for salmon as well
3611350 we believe that california has enough water for its people farms and fish
3611351 if we manage our water better we can protect our states economy and our environment we can have a thriving fishing industry in the future and we can make sure our farms are able to produce the food and jobs that we need
3611352 could soon disappear permanently from the states rivers restaurant menus and supermarkets if massive water diversions from the san francisco bay delta continue unabated
3611353 fish out of water how water management in the bay delta threatens the future of californias salmon fishery
3611354 the future of californias salmon fishery is completely dependent on how we manage water in the bay delta ecosystem
3611355 california agencies must implement existing requirements to restore salmon reform management of the water projects and reduce water diversions
3611356 the collapse of the salmon fishery is among the nations worst man made fishery disasters ever
3611357 it is on par with the exxon valdez spill or the closure of the new england cod fishery but we believe that we can bring back our fishery if we do the right things in managing our waters in the rivers and in the delta we can save our salmon and save our birthright
3611358 commercial salmon fishermen are paying a heavy price for the poaching of water from the bay delta the policy of this state is to double salmon populations not decimate them
3611359 we need to reduce delta diversions if we expect to bring back the salmon the bottom line is fish need water
3611360 now the state is considering a peripheral canal which the ppic report states could have major negative effects on salmon
3611361 this is ridiculous we are only now starting to right the wrongs of the bush administrations illegal water plans the debate about the peripheral canal is adding insult to injury to californias fishing communities
3611362 those of us who represent the delta region and its watershed know that the peripheral canal is not likely to solve our challenges from the disappearance of our states iconic salmon fishery to the repair and management of the fragile levees that support our communities
3611363 its past time for us to develop a sustainable water policy for all californians any water plan that focuses on exports and excludes the protection of the bay delta is a non starter as it has been for the last thirty years
3611364 kaweah oaks is one of the last remnant valley oak forests left in the central valley and was a logical place to stop as we shored up our otherwise fairly sparse valley oak sites kaweah river ecological reserve took a bit of searching despite the directions in the usually reliable oaks of california we drove right past it and marked 10 trees along somebodys driveway before we eventually discovered the reserve above not below the road in any case the addition of these populations brings the total number of species covered by the survey to 7 the total number of sites 16 the total number of populations surveyed 41 and the total number of individual trees 958 the survey now covers all tree species in california except for the island oak we still havent figured out any way to make it out to santa cruz island efficiently the shreve oak which i didnt even know existed until now and of course the tanbark oak which we really should survey somewhere even if it isnt a damn quercus
3611365 evapotranspiration is a measurement of the amount of water vapor returned to the air in a given area moisture is put into the air from evaporation the process by which water becomes a vapor suspended in air molecules and from transpiration the active exhalation of water through plant skin this is essentially the opposite of rainfall outside humidity is the amount of water in the air outside of the box in which the console is contained relative humidity is an expression of the amount of water held in the air in relation to the amount of water that the air can hold which is affected by temperature and air pressure relative humidity and evapotranspiration are closely related because if the relative humidity is close to its holding capacity plants ability to evapotranspire may be inhibited
3611366 vegetation influences the level of water stress to which oak seedlings are exposed in several ways overstory and understory plants compete with oak seedlings for available soil moisture overstory and tall understory species can also shade oak seedlings elevate relative humidity and reduce temperature and wind speed thereby reducing evapotranspiration demand many california plant ecologists accept the conjecture that soil moisture is less available in oak woodlands now than it was in presettlement times due to the replacement of native herbaceous vegetation with nonindigenous annual grasses and forbs definitive evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking largely because the nature of the presettlement understory is poorly understood blue oak seedlings experience high levels of water stress during the summer griffin 1973 but it is not possible to determine whether these levels of summer water stress have changed since settlement
3611367 in her book tending the wild m kat anderson has painted a very different picture of indigenous peoples than most civilized people could even begin to fathom she begins by taking us through the history of california and its native peoples using accounts of explorers missionaries pioneers and anthropologists she shows how those of our culture came to california with no understanding or lens with which to understand native land management rather like everywhere else civilization saw resources to extract came and conquered california and her people with californias wildlife amp native cultures now decimated newer research has shown that native land management actually contributed to enhancing the biological diversity and abundance of life anderson argues that if we wish to restore our mutual relationship with nature we must learn these ancient management techniques and implement them immediately although she uses only california natives to back her thesis we can witness these same principles among indigenous cultures the world over this book works not only as a history of indigenous horticulture in california but mostly as a beginners manual for those who seek to understand more about sustainable indigenous land management this book rocked my world

3611427 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3611428 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3611429 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3611430 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3611431 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3611432 farmers would only be making market level returns on other crops
3611433 the mautner project improves the health of lesbians bisexual and transgender women who partner with women and their families through advocacy education research and direct service the mautner project envisions a healthcare system that is guided by social justice and responsive to the needs of all people
3611434 i dont think many male scientists who had an advisee whose child was dying would ask them to choose between that and their research
3611435 women have achieved parity in the tenure track in the humanities
3611436 there are very good reasons to think that something like string theory is going to be part of the ultimate understanding of quantum gravity
3611437 there are very good reasons to think that a neutrino is what it needed to reconcile our theories of particle physics which at the moment appear inconsistent with each other
3611438 it must be right or at the very least something like string theory is correct
3611439 bitter emotions and obsolete understanding of high energy physics aug 25 2006
3611440 peter woit is the owner of a well known blog that provides high energy theoretical physics with the same service as william dembskis id blog offers to evolutionary biology it is designed to misinterpret and obscure virtually every event in physics and transform it into poison and to invent his own fantasies to hurt science this makes woits blog highly popular among the crackpots for example some of the reviewers of this book
3611441 first of all up front before the patient left the united states we believe that we could strengthen our states ability to restrict the movement of patients before they demonstrate noncompliance with the medical order
3611442 thats not the federal governments role and its far far too broad a statement there has to be a credible threat a direct threat of harm before you restrict someones freedom to move before you intrude on their individual liberties
3611443 for her to say in such a broad manner that a state should restrict people before theyre noncompliant is extremely intrusive in my view
3611444 again with the rapidity of world travel today it seems to me that this time frame should have been collapsed to just a few hours
3611445 i think we should have done it faster and i think well be able to accelerate this next time in retrospect that was a mistake and i wish we had done it differently
3611446 these findings have given rise to a school of scientists promoting the theory of intelligent design which suggests that some force embodying purpose and foresight lay behind the origin of the universe
3611447 professor howard professor fine professor howard report to the headmasters office
3611448 after all if people say god could not have created the universe because this gives rise to the question who created god
3611449 whether or not they are right and i dont know their scientific argument about the absence of evidence to support the claim that life spontaneously created itself is being stifled on the totally perverse grounds that this argument does not conform to the rules of science which require evidence to support a theory
3611450 the heart of the judeo christian tradition is the belief in the concept of truth which gives rise to reason
3611451 whether or not they are right and i dont know their scientific argument about the absence of evidence to support the claim that life spontaneously created itself is being stifled on the totally perverse grounds that this argument does not conform to the rules of science which require evidence to support a theory
3611452 some force embodying purpose and foresight lay behind the origin of the universe
3611453 so um i dont know the first thing about science but since my religion imagines that life started when the universe started scientists must think so too and life that means evolution right i know one thing though as im no longer allowed to imagine up things i like to know for certain it is unfair that science have facts to know i rather dont know at all
3611454 its the first effect of not believing in god that you lose your common sense
3611455 scientists like dawkins say such questions are unanswerable and therefore should not be asked
3611456 and please no one should bring up the unfortunate coincidence that it isnt atheists who are standing in line at lourdes or seeing mother teresa in a tortilla or letting televangelists thwack them in the forehead or are sending in 10 bills with their paper prayer mats
3611457 tell the israelites to turn back and encamp near pi hahiroth between migdol and the sea
3611458 ms phillips comes in for a lot of slack but i complete support her ideas i would like to publicly declare that i believe whole heartedly that science is destroying our faiths and beliefs simply by overpowering and using facts to denounce religion stewart holmes scarborough uk
3611459 only in america will science overtake religion becuase sic their sic is so much free speech its a good thing
3611460 dawkins big bang theory is laughable imagine being in the local having a pint with friends when one of them says hey ive discovered the origin of the universe it started with a big bang which developed all the material in the universe in an instant in one billionenth of a second there was nothing and then there was everything i dont know about you but i would say yeah right is it my round but when someone with the pedigree of dawkins says it the world gasps and accepts this crazy theory as being right common sense tells us that to cause an explosion there needs to be at least three constituents the explosive material and a match to light the fuse so my question to dawkins is who was holding the match
3611461 god created the universe but we we dont know where god came from
3611462 the universe started with the big bang but we dont know what caused it
3611463 they try to push you around and tell you what to do
3611464 when people stop believing in god they dont believe in nothing they believe in anything
3611465 me either the parting of the red sea is a miracle or one really terrible metaphor or a natural phenomenon
3611466 we by far the dominant sub species of the human kind who value irrational thinking and scientific illiteracy demand from the minority sub species who value rationel thinking and scientific litteracy that they stop doing what they do as they are causing mayhem and destruction within our dominant sub species
3611467 only in america will science overtake religion becuase their is so much free speech its a good thing
3611468 that is stephen hawkings clever analogy for big bang cosmologies especially apt for his and jim hartles no boundary cosmologies
3611469 so depending on the cosmological model there will be a full solution for time rather effectively so volumes around cosmological singularities excepted for the time being
3611470 the big bang is only the rebound at no time is there ever a real singularity and at no time is there ever a time before the big bang its cyclic interesting theory
3611471 while the charge of the electron is known to seven decimal places physicists lose track of g after only the third for some thats an embarrassment
3611472 there is something to be said for or rather against maoist style regimes that simply ban religion the effect tending to be that the population opens up to even zanier superstitions
3611473 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3611474 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
3611475 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
3611476 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3611477 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3611478 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3611479 joining forces with the industry leader will enable us to improve our financial performance above and beyond what we could do independently
3611480 this acquisition accelerates our expansion into central and northern california and hawaii
3611481 site selection in northern and central california is pretty costly and time consuming we estimate the time frame needed to assemble a quality portfolio like the longs stores we are acquiring would be at least 10 years
3611482 there are opportunities for some relocations maybe 10 to 15 percent of the fleet over time but there is no rush in doing that
3611483 longs has done a lot of things to improve its operations and some make it more compatible with the way cvs does business
3611484 fool us once shame on you fool us twice shame on us
3611485 allowing students to assist in the creation of rubrics may be a good learning experience for them
3611486 if students do not help to create the different rubrics teachers will probably want to share those rubrics with students before they complete the task or project
3611487 rubrics can be produced quite easily and quickly once students are confident in creating them

3611513 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3611514 the peace process has not addressed the concerns of kashmiris they want to see an end to uncertainty they want a resolution of the kashmir dispute
3611515 the protests are serious and should serve as a wake up call
3611516 firing on protesters speaks of indian double standards in jammu three protesters were killed during several days of curfew but in the muslim kashmir valley six people are martyred on the very first day of a curfew
3611517 after these shooting incidents we have lost whatever love we had for indians
3611518 the rising pro freedom protests will definitely give impetus to the freedom struggle
3611519 what we are seeing is the revival of the separatist movement in kashmir which had been in a dying stage
3611520 it is interesting to note that the newspapers gave the left and the bjp almost equal weightage and even sometimes they preferred left over the bjp

3611577 why should the motorists of australia not have access to the same price information that the good motorists of western australia have had for many years
3611578 it is the liberals who decide what happens in the senate theyve decided that they will back big oil companies rather than give information to consumers like motorists have had in this state for many years

3611666 anyone whos pitched as long as he has your arm is going to be tired he could use this as a steppingstone to the big leagues hes a professional
3611667 hey stan there must be a party on the 3rd floor lets go check it out
3611668 i know my limits and am realistic about my ability
3611669 i would never attempt a whitney or a mariah song youll always get compared and there is no comparison
3611670 its strange to be working with louis who would have thought six years on id be sitting next to him doing the same job
3611671 i was a bit apprehensive but he was the first to come to my dressing room he helped to make me feel comfortable and welcome
3611672 im just looking at your eyes your eyelashes im obsessed its a nice thing girls must love it youre quite girly but youve got a mans body youre so different to guys i go out with youre buff
3611673 sometimes i change my opinion on you sometimes you look different to me earlier you looked more like macho man but tonight you look cute i think close up you look more adorable i think youre quite opinionated and i quite like it you put yourself down a lot youre not a minger
3611674 i dont like compliments its embarrassing leave it there i dont like it
3611675 have you ever given a compliment to anyone in the house youve never said anything nice about me
3611676 at some point youre thinking about going for a field goal
3611677 im very proud of him cause hes worked so hard hes a good kid and hes living a dream
3611678 ill tell them i got out three all stars in the first inning
3611679 they were starting to elevate some balls in the fifth
3611680 ive never played in this great of a climate i dont want to go out there and sweat
3611681 ive run for first downs before so why not have it
3611682 this morning they did some real good things and im happy for them i hope it pays off for these guys too
3611683 its like learning something in american and then going and trying to learn something in spanish
3611684 youre talking about the same thing but you just have to train your brain to think a little bit different
3611685 i dont know what happened i just couldnt do anything right over there
3611686 i dont think i was even there long enough to give a good assessment of what i could do for the team i just felt like i didnt have enough time
3611687 he asks questions as far as coach how do i do this again right there and then i knew he was a detail oriented young man
3611688 hes been pounding it hes behind the eight ball right now but hopefully hell be able to pick it up and catch up with the defense as quickly as he can
3611689 in oakland i was a starter for 2 1 2 years and everything was just second nature here its every day i have to prove myself
3611690 its strange when it happens but obviously you have to find a way to win the game
3611691 it didnt go foul so we have to battle and preserve the tie game
3611692 delmon hitting the big three run homer that was pretty doggone exciting
3611693 its just unfortunate that we couldnt come up with another run after that
3611694 we hit into five double plays mo gives up three runs
3611695 you see things youve never seen before when youre going through struggles like we are right now and you really come to expect the unexpected you just have to battle back
3611696 i have nothing but admiration for those guys bears coach lovie smith gm jerry angelo all the players there
3611697 unfortunately in the nfl theres a business side too and i ended up here and im happy i wish them the best id love to see them down the line in the postseason that would be special i still talk to all those guys brian urlacher adewale ogunleye
3611698 im not really sure how defenses are going to play
3611699 they know favres caliber of play they may back up they may not
3611700 obviously as a running back you want to go in there with six guys in the box thats one less guy that you have to deal with before you get in the secondary but im prepared to deal with every situation hopefully itll be something positive
3611701 he has the innate ability to look one way and still know he can go another way and get the ball there in time a lot of quarterbacks cant go from this side to that side and still put the ball in there
3611702 hell embarrass you if youre not on top of your game
3611703 i did think i was going to be here my rookie year
3611704 eventually it came back around i guess it was meant for me to play with the jets
3611705 just growing up and watching him play and now hes actually my quarterback
3611706 id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3611707 an internet based group that only referred to itself as anonymous held protests outside scientology centers in cities around the world in february 2008 as part of project chanology
3611708 i wish i was 21 temptations started to take root then came college and as they say that slippery slope got wet i went from about 200 to 300 over the next 18 months
3611709 with the altitude the sunshine and non stop opportunities for outdoor activities the weight would just work itself off and id be in rip roaring form in no time
3611710 do not do this unless you are quite sure your heart and the rest of you will stand it i would find it most disagreeable to be accused of precipitating your death especially in court
3611711 the computer featured 64 kilobits of memory a lot for 1982

3611713 our primary concern is the safety and welfare of our pet owners and their pets
3611714 although the finished product tested negative and we have received no reports of illness of pets or their owners out of an abundance of caution we are issuing a voluntary recall of the limited number of bags of pedigree complete nutrition small crunchy bites containing the component in question

3611725 speaker pelosi and the democrats said they had a commonsense energy plan when gas was 2 10 a gallon and then last year they voted on an energy bill that did not mention exploration but did mention changing light bulbs hundreds of times now gas prices have doubled where is their plan
3611726 the democrats solution is to push gimmickry and call it an energy bill but the republican plan is for solar wind coal to liquid ocs conservation and new technologies we need an up or down vote weve done all we can and now its up to you the american people this is the peoples house and you need to call your member of congress and demand the speaker call the house back in session
3611727 why wont the speaker of the house allow the peoples elected representatives a vote
3611728 high energy prices significantly undermine our way of life and our national security i intend to be here on this floor until the job is done

3611736 everything ive done in the last four years has been for beijing so my desire to run has never disappeared but considering my current situation i have to give it up because of my withdrawal theres going to be much heavier expectation of teammates tosa and nakamura so i worry that the pressure on them is going to be even stronger but i sincerely hope they do well in beijing
3611737 que esta pasando con la gente de la sagrada familia
3611738 the sayings of christ co exist passively in their minds producing hardly any effect beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland
3611739 the left side of my face seems to be melting off of my skull i guess i am looking directly into the ark of the covenant are they going for the bells palsy thing here my left side looks like brittany spears vagina
3611740 i am the vine you are the branches he who abides in me and i in him he it is that bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing
3611741 come to me all who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
3611742 no really guys youve done more to undermine the cause of healthy eating world wide than any other company we just dont think this is the kind of product we want associated with the games
3611743 i dont need an anti depressant i need new running shoes or maybe a big mac
3611744 my virtues are a reason to vote for me but my vices cant be held against me
3611745 theres consequences to it you cant take it out of pencils paper and paper clips
3611746 it will eventually mean a reduction in staff theres no other option
3611747 we have spent more money in this budget than we have
3611748 now we have to deal with that and were going to have to cut
3611749 if we dont do this the temptation will be for those departments to continue filling more positions
3611750 im confident that i can manage it but it wont be painless
3611751 we are at a point where we all have to bite the bullet
3611752 were not trying to punish anybody but we have to find ways to work together
3611753 if they are going to build towers at elementary schools parents should have input if theyre not involved they should be
3611754 the district must make it their highest priority to recognize the value of their employees
3611755 this is the first time the number has drastically surpassed the united states becoming the worlds number one
3611756 its unique for a theme park to be known for crafts for number one and food for number two
3611757 i dont stand behind the stove and pretend that i know everything

3611759 the game of chess is not merely an idle amusement
3611760 this isnt the time to say i told you so
3611761 weve worked well and its a nice feeling where we are at the moment but theres no euphoria or feeling of told you so there is a much bigger prize
3611762 if we can beat canberra then the play offs are achievable
3611763 i have never felt anything other than what i thought was needed in terms of retaining or attaining the players we have
3611764 im not going to comment on whether brian smith has been vindicated for the changes he made last season
3611765 last year was last year and i will always want the knights to be successful but theres a right and wrong way of doing things and i think the way things were done last year was not right you cant help but put a lot of their success down to the form of kurt gidley and danny buderus
3611766 the decision to re sign kurt gidley early in the season has been the signing of the season
3611767 since chief executive steve burraston locked him up after round one or two he has improved out of sight
3611768 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a seven per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3611769 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3611770 the care and welfare of residents is our primary concern
3611771 if facilities are found to be non compliant action will be taken
3611772 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms
3611773 this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
3611774 further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets people with lewy body disease suffer memory loss visual hallucinations and movement difficulties
3611775 unfortunately research is severely underfunded and much more is needed if we are to defeat this devastating disease
3611776 the formation of lewy bodies is a key event in the development of nerve cell death associated with parkinsons disease
3611777 you could fund an entire cyberwarfare campaign for the cost of replacing a tank tread so you would be foolish not to
3611778 could this somehow be indirect russian action yes but considering russia is past playing nice and uses real bombs they could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the infrastructure kinetically
3611779 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the rbn and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3611780 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
3611781 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
3611782 at this stage we have a temporary cessation of hostilities which is certainly significant but the night is long and we want to have the best possible result
3611783 sometimes when things look very good on paper in real life the situation is very different
3611784 south ossetia is a very complicated matter that cannot be solved by politics
3611785 no evidence has been found suggesting a connection between the incidents according to the police
3611786 many plain unattractive homely girls had been closely observed by my mother many had told her of the bitterness and heartaches that were theirs of the envy of the beautiful girls who were given without seeking all the favors they so vainly craved
3611787 a girls appearance can often mean the difference between success and failure in lifes many roles
3611788 the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people

3611797 the walls looked like they were moving sometimes there were so many bugs and roaches on the wall
3611798 when the door first opened roaches fell from the ceiling down to the floor so i knew then we were in for something
3611799 there was garbage packed up to the ceiling the smell was so overwhelming the investigator had to where a gas mask
3611800 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside
3611801 chicken and chips was pretty much their diet there was evidence of some other things in there like old pizza boxes but from what i understand those were his and the kids and her were not allowed to partake
3611802 from what i understand he just left and didnt come back and she got word somehow i dont know what happened but she got word somehow that he got involved with another lady
3611803 nobody in this community knew that he had children or a wife thats whats so strange about this this family was so afraid of this man that he said they are not to leave and they did not leave
3611804 he was always talking to my son and to my boyfriend just being normal like normal people do
3611805 your prayers worked she has gone peacefully to god thank you and everyone for the support you gave to her and to me
3611806 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock

3611811 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan
3611812 we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3611813 do obama supporters still get headaches after they had their lobomy
3611814 even if hillary should publicly in person denounce all 527s who are trying to get her nominated and elected we cant give throw sic in the towel clearly the chicago political mafia is strong arming her to disown us
3611815 we will start with the democratic party and then work to bring together the rest of the country we will come together at our common goals and go forward together strengthened and mighty
3611816 we will all need to come together before the fall lets craft a message that even wingers will envy some of us have lost our minds lately we are putting conditions and litmus tests on our candidates we are getting lost in the trees while failing to see the forest
3611817 there will be a lot of calls for unity but let us acknowledge what this really is unity is a weapon that the party is going to use against us
3611818 i dont think its just to prove a point i think its a very important point were making
3611819 do dems who supported hilllary really want to punish bho by voting rep
3611820 michael phelps das ph nomen er ist der gr te matt biondi und mark spitz waren gro er ist gr er so gro ist keiner er macht wunder wahr sein geheimnis ist dass er wei was er will und dass er dieses ziel mit allem verfolgt was er hat er fokussiert dabei alles nur auf sich
3611821 von den ergebnissen her ist michael phelps sicherlich der gr te aber ich bin baff dass einer der schon vor jahren so unglaubliche zeiten erzielt hat sich weiter in diesem ausma steigern kann

3611823 wir sitzen einfach hier und warten auf irgendetwas im fernsehen gibt es nur drei kan le auf denen nur filme laufen ich kenne 300 schon auswendig manchmal fliegen flugzeuge ber uns hinweg in der n he steht ein panzer hin und wieder werden die filme von ansprachen des pr sidenten unterbrochen bleiben sie zu hause es ist alles in ordnung viele verlassen mit ihren familien die stadt und wieder der pr sident bis morgen wird nicht gebombt so also ist das leben dass gerade begonnen hat die volle apathie die empfindung der hoffnungslosigkeit die erwartung des endes
3611824 pr sident saakaschwili ist im fernsehen ist im fernsehen aufgetreten er hat angek ndigt dass sich die georgischen truppen ohne waffen vor den russischen aufbauen werden sie werden stehen stehen stehen und wenn die russen schie en ist es mord an friedlichen bewohnern das ist so frustrierend es riecht nach provokation

3611831 der angegriffene steht halt als kleines dummerchen da der keine ahnung vom internet hat
3611832 das szenario dass irgendwelche hacker einen atomangriff starten k nnen halte ich f r relativ unwahrscheinlich da muss man schon einen insider haben der zugang zu dem system hat

3611834 children who consumed 2 or more servings of dairy and 4 ounces of meat or other nondairy protein had bone mineral contents over 300 grams higher than those children with lower intakes of both dairy and other proteins
3611835 dairy is a key source of proteins calcium and other micronutrients including phosphorus and vitamin d
3611836 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or therapy environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such therapys would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3611837 this is a new approach to the therapy of drug addiction that has great potential additionally this might also be used to treat other neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive memories including post traumatic stress and phobic anxiety disorders
3611838 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3611839 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3611840 prior studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3611841 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3611842 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3611843 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after therapy
3611844 i felt so good pulling on the costume for the first time so confident and in control i really felt like an action heroine
3611845 im not looking for a long term relationship but playing lara croft the sexiest game heroine there is should get me a few more dates
3611846 daaaaad stop embarrassing me in front of my friends you do it all the time
3611847 i cant help it its hard even for me to resist telling your friends that masturbation is a sin
3611848 i was leading at about 70 meters and then i did a whole bunch of crap i didnt relax and run straight through the finish line like i was supposed to do
3611849 other people only see me out there running and theyre jeering and criticizing and saying a whole bunch of stuff
3611850 but they dont know the real person or what im going through
3611851 my brothers michael and vaughan died and i think about them all of the time
3611852 thats why i wanted their names on there i am dedicating my races to them
3611853 when people think about jamaica they think about bob marley
3611854 ive hit some great things in practice for the last couple of weeks

3611856 you know lunatics difference from other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them

3611861 that was a good time it ended up being more than i thought it was going to be as far as going back and competing there to get ready for these olympics
3611862 im glad i did it now the average age was probably 25 26 yeah i was the father
3611863 if the opportunity comes up it would be great if it doesnt its been good so i just want to concentrate on this and enjoy these olympics while were here if its bound to happen it will and if not im totally content
3611864 i feel good at the beginning when i first started throwing in that league it was a little bit iffy
3611865 but over time my arm got back to where its been before
3611866 anyone whos pitched as long as he has your arm is going to be tired he could use this as a steppingstone to the big leagues hes a professional
3611867 i want to try to help out the kids for them to learn to play the game the right way and try to give back that way
3611868 good example of the over hysteria i was speaking about
3611869 banishing breastfeeding women to dark corners where we can pretend they dont exist
3611870 please somehow anyhow offend me so i can be outraged and have my very own cause
3611871 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds

3611874 tehrik e taliban and al qaeda theyre all under attack we suspect this blast has been done by tehrik e taliban to take revenge for our activities
3611875 we are hitting their hideouts so naturally they are responding

3611889 the immediate support is now at 4515 4500 on the nifty below which it may slide to 4500 4470 4445 a decisive breach of 4500 at this juncture will signal fresh weakness and below 4440 however the downside is likely to gain fresh momentum the outcome of meet on participatory notes is likely to turn the markets volatile so make the best of it
3611890 i fell in love with the script and the story i wanted to show it to the people of this country and the audience it sensitised me towards my own kids and i am happy that it has sensitised parents who have children with such problems like dyslexia
3611891 this study gives women a ballpark feel for what to look forward to at the point of five year survival they are not totally free from the risk of recurrence as some women would like to believe but they arent totally doomed either
3611892 and if you take these numbers at face value breast cancer survivors have a pretty good chance of escaping recurrence after five years of survival
3611893 the message id really like to get across is that these recurrence rates are actually pretty low and i hope these numbers are reassuring to women because women who are five year survivors of breast cancer often think they are still at high risk for recurrence

3611899 theres a lot of complaining going on i call 311 all the time there are a lot of things not to like about bloomberg but this 311 thing is one of the most empowering things ive ever seen people have had this shit for seven years and now they can let go this is going to be a vehicle for letting go

3611901 people are leaving comments and sending me emails about how great the site is and it has been a real joy to know that people are re connecting with old friends as well as making new ones
3611902 i started the network and provided a platform but it has been the work and excitement of everyone involved inviting their family and friends that has helped it to build so quickly
3611903 i had just spent 5 hours researching dominica to put together a special hubpage about it and after i finished that i realized there was a huge gap in my knowlege
3611904 now its all about growing and coming together as a community i hope to make supporting people who run a business by buying their products and donating to charities two of our biggest missions
3611905 nothing material happened today we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming
3611906 the markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you
3611907 this is another example of integrating exxonmobils project management capabilities with developing angolan businesses and suppliers to deliver exceptional value
3611908 the timely and cost efficient development of this resource provides additional production to help meet the worlds growing energy demand working closely with sonangol we have reached another milestone in developing angolas significant petroleum resources in a manner that maximizes the value of the resource for angola co venturers and our shareholders
3611909 we hope he gore will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3611910 im sorry im bad im sorry your blue im sorry for all the things i said to you
3611911 we cannot end these traditions just because there is no king
3611912 the fact that nepal is now a republic is not an excuse to drop centuries old traditions
3611913 its natural that these religious ceremonies are carried out by the president or prime minister
3611914 for centuries nepal has remained socially harmonious despite being a multi ethnic multi lingual and multi faith country
3611915 it was the king who was a central point of unity
3611916 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3611917 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3611918 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3611919 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3611920 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3611921 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports
3611922 there were reports about presence of arab turkmen and local militants in the two hideouts run by a local commander zanjir
3611923 platinum at the time was just a cost we could not afford
3611924 the rating is wonderful because people think its a huge mountain to climb but we did it
3611925 it needs to adhere to all setbacks the height requirements and there needs to be a scaling down on the mass of the building
3611926 i support the idea of a hotel it will be a good source of economic revenue but it needs to fall in line with the character of the city
3611927 our chief goal is to try to get the city of cupertino prepared for disasters
3611928 were going to keep coming back for up to three weeks until youre
3611929 we welcomed our new neighbors who just moved in within the past couple of weeks connected with our old neighbors we had a great gathering and our neighbors are connected better

3611931 theyre just looking for anything visible and easy to grab they just walk around and canvass the area
3611932 empty out the interior dont leave briefcases laptops or anything out put it in the trunk when you leave your car
3611933 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3611934 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3611935 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims

3611938 jeg siger ikke at der ikke kommer konkurser og skandaler inden for universet af kapitalfonde men det har vi jo af og til ogs med b rsnoterede og familieejede virksomheder
3611939 i den internationale industri er vi glade for kapitalfondene som et nyttigt finansieringsalternativ til bankl n og b rsnotering

3611944 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3611945 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3611946 the 3g iphone will be shipped directly from the us distribution will be based purely on demand with no particular city getting any preference
3611947 we are doing our best to ensure that there are no delivery issues the handsets will be delivered without any waiting period
3611948 the price of the handset and tariff will be at par
3611949 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3611950 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3611951 continuing violations of federal law are critical to plant safety
3611952 oshas current view that bp products is in compliance with the osha agreement is in essence a decision not to take any further enforcement for a breach of the agreement
3611953 the mortgage finance system in the united states has been badly damaged
3611954 there is definitely some reinvention that will need to occur and that will include some explicit involvement by the government
3611955 to the extent that home prices keep spiraling down the need for capital keeps increasing
3611956 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3611957 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3611958 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3611959 were making progress but we still have much to do
3611960 the nurses wanted substantive pay raises retiree health benefits nurse to patient staffing based on acuity and other benefits guaranteed in a contract
3611961 there was a counting of ballots but its not clear there was a fair election process
3611962 is what is at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like it came from another time
3611963 is as much interested in the relations with russia as russia is in the relations with the united states
3611964 with todays high energy prices it is as important as ever for us to try to control our fuel costs and reduce risks associated with fuel price volatility
3611965 we adjust our fuel hedges on an ongoing basis depending on market conditions and the forward looking analytics for jet fuel
3611966 some airlines particularly southwest airlines reduced the impact of rising fuel prices on their costs through fuel hedges
3611967 however most of those airlines hedges are limited or in the case of southwest will expire within the next few years and may be replaced with new but more expensive hedges
3611968 ive been farming for 33 years and this was probably one of the hardest springs ive had putting a crop in
3611969 i just planted it wet and hoped mother nature would keep sending the rain to get it up
3611970 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define its a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3611971 the effort is admirable but i just dont see it making a tremendous difference
3611972 even 21 miles per gallon highway isnt enough for consumers theyre looking for something approaching 30
3611973 we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible

3611978 the moscow authorities will use this opportunity to remind ukraine of the damages of allying itself with nato
3611979 georgia will be enormously more careful in its actions in the future and much less confident of its relationship with the united states
3611980 russia may find it convenient to raise the level of tension with ukraine in the run up to the december nato review
3611981 if the conflict with russia decelerates or reverses georgias integration with the west a similar fate could also affect ukraine
3611982 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3611983 if it reacts too violently against ukraine then it risks provoking the reaction it least wants trade and investment barriers for its companies a more antagonistic approach to energy transit and above all it risks scaring ukraine into seeking western protection
3611984 considering both european reticence and possible fears about ukraine i think it is very much on the slow track
3611985 a substantial part of our military power has been destroyed
3611986 however we did preserve the core of our army and have managed to regroup it close to the capital
3611987 its a reassertion of russias dominant role in the region
3611988 ser a buena una exposici n del ministro de educaci n acerca de los cambios a los consejos de convivencia y de los lineamientos respecto a los t rminos disciplinarios
3611989 es ist zwar ein unsicheres makro konomisches umfeld in amerika und europa doch unser business hat sich in j ngerer zeit recht zufriedenstellend entwickelt
3611990 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3611991 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3611992 it would be silly hitching the train to something that has no track record to this point
3611993 there are some people who want our shows on their platform and seem to think i owe them a favor
3611994 tubemogul who i just absolutely adore thats a great example of a great product and great people behind it if i had to upload episodes of abigail to 15 places at a time i would never leave the house but because of their fantastic product its a click of a button
3611995 program promoting consumable items and more functional discretionary products which only tractor supply sells worked well
3611996 now through translations we are seeing a lot of growth in international countries
3611997 they have gotten these things up and going quickly and the audiences are up
3611998 hi5 has really put an emphasis on cultural relevance beyond just the translation
3611999 the platform is open and as soon as advertisers find value they just start creating campaigns
3612000 given the current economic weakness we find the education services stocks to be a timely relative safe haven with favorable intermediate term prospects
3612001 in addition to avoiding many costs of a traditional university tenured professors decentralized curriculums dorms and large physical libraries for profit schools usually are also more nimble at identifying which programs will be profitable and in demand
3612002 but if he is taking something written by somebody else and putting it together as some sort of compilation to create the book then some different inferences might flow
3612003 i dont even know why my client is wearing the thing on his head
3612004 to me its odd to him it is perfectly normal
3612005 i served with sen mccain and he and i were the only two to vote against the bush cheney tax cuts
3612006 during this campaign it is a different john mccain he is saying he would make the tax cuts permanent he is advocating more drilling whereas he voted against drilling in anwr it goes to his credibility and that is such an important issue for this country plus his foreign policy has been consistently with bush cheney and i know from my perspective that is a huge issue for the united states
3612007 i think the little flare up we are witnessing in georgia is another illustration of the different approach these two men are taking
3612008 mccain is bellicose threatening to kick russia out of the g8 use force if it is required obama is far more of the traditional position turn to international institutions call for reconciliation call for an end of hostilities but also be firm in his words and thats the kind of leadership we need
3612009 there are a number of very impressive vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is sen obama but i would be hopeful that among the serious list of people to be considered would be chuck hagel
3612010 i think chuck would be the type of republican who will represent well this country
3612011 it will encourage others to come on because they will see that there is a growing number of republicans around the country that support him
3612012 the portfolio of issues passed on to the next president is as daunting as any since wwii the case for inspiring new political leadership and the social ethic has seldom been more evident barack obamas platform is a call for change but the change that he is articulating is more renewal than departure it is rooted in very old american values that are very much part of the republican as well as the democratic tradition the national interest requires a new approach to our interaction with the world including the recognition that a long term occupation of iraq is likely dangerously destabilizing
3612013 even when oil was at 140 a barrel consumer spending was slowing but not stopping

3612015 technology has changed so dramatically that we can change how we actually operate
3612016 a lot of what we were doing is if you will an old fashioned approach to newsgathering
3612017 what makes the difference is how were able to get out spread those journalists to more places and how quickly we can bring back original reporting to our viewers
3612018 you want to do what its over four miles of walking in the rough up and down while carrying a 30 pound sign that must be changed as the scores change and its gonna be 85 degrees or more with matching humidity can you do it
3612019 be here by 6 30 a m tomorrow johns got an early tee time
3612020 hold the sign above your head parallel to the galleries while walking from one hole to the next its o k to put it down when on the tee box or the green but thats all hold it high hold it proudly
3612021 its important to change the numbers of each golfer quickly and before going to the next tee the fans in the gallery want correct scores youll be walking with an official scorer who will have the correct number if you dont

3612023 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports he said
3612024 there were reports about presence of arab turkmen and local militants in the two hideouts run by a local commander zanjir wazir he added
3612025 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports he said
3612026 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3612027 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3612028 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3612029 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3612030 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married
3612031 i want an mba because it seems like a great way to find myself
3612032 i really like what im learning about the job i just hope it pays enough i wont bring it up until they do so that i dont seem too greedy
3612033 shall we talk about comp ranges now id hate to waste your time or mine if were not in the ballpark with respect to the salary level
3612034 it could well be the end of the summer the long range forecast for the rest of august is for very unsettled weather no one can say for certain
3612035 rotten weather does not always mean a rotten time for tourism
3612036 suffolks message is that the county is a good place to come whatever the weather
3612037 there were some good early indications the problems with the economy will be having an affect the benefit to uk tourist destinations of a bad exchange rate with the euro means that people on a budget will be more likely to holiday here
3612038 we want people to see suffolk as a year round destination whatever the weather
3612039 when the weather is bad people spend more time in town centres which can be a good thing for places like bury st edmunds and ipswich so even though we havent had blazing hot weather it has meant that fewer people have just sat on a beach people are doing more
3612040 coastal areas tend to suffer more when the weather is bad the beaches in the area havent been packed and there werent many people on felixstowe beach yesterday
3612041 but indoor attractions though have seen a rise in visitor numbers when it is really grim i am not surprised their numbers are up
3612042 with a day like today people look outside in the morning and see its pouring down and then make a decision as to whether or not to go out
3612043 today we have had about half the number of visitors we would expect for the summer holidays and obviously people are feeling short of money at the moment
3612044 we had poor weather at easter too however we have had a lot of feedback saying that people are staying locally rather than going abroad this year
3612045 the rain has not been too great but the gardens are looking wonderful
3612046 i think because of the weather we had last summer people are making the most of things anyway and coming out rain or shine
3612047 we have still got more rain to come im afraid there is some unsettling weather expected in the next couple of days
3612048 today we are likely to see some heavy showers with rumbles of thunder tomorrow friday is looking like the best day this week
3612049 at the weekend rain will push across from the west on saturday and there are likely to still be some unsettled conditions into the start of next week
3612050 so far this month we have seen 62mm of rain fall with the average for august being nearer the 47mm so with still two weeks left we have already seen a third more rain than we would expect to see and exceeded the average rain fall
3612051 last august there was a lower recorded rain fall in the whole month we saw the average expected of about 44mm
3612052 it will be interesting to know exactly what the decision was i dont know whether we get it in writing or not but well ask
3612053 we have to be confident going into gb usa and even argentina nine points is still in front of us
3612054 you need six points out of the next two games and go into the argie game with nothing to lose
3612055 she started to show that shes got potential and a lot of pace
3612056 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3612057 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3612058 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3612059 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3612060 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3612061 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3612062 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3612063 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3612064 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3612065 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3612066 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3612067 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3612068 i came across the rumble strips through their cover of back to black and amy winehouse and i agreed it was kind of better than our own
3612069 i picked up their album and fell in love with it
3612070 then i decided i wanted to sign them to my label and work on their next album it was really as straightforward as that were all very excited about this
3612071 i am very pleased that we can be so confident around the progress to date and that we are in a position where we will be able to publicly share this information with the local community in the near future suffolk homes
3612072 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3612073 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3612085 i watched some of the pga championship and want to congratulate padraig harrington on his wins at the british open and pga
3612086 i know im in no condition to beat anybody right now so i dont have a problem with not being able to compete
3612087 i will definitely watch some of the ryder cup matches and will be pulling hard for the american team
3612088 the thing i miss the most about not competing is the fight ive gone through this experience before so i knew what i was in for
3612089 as a two time defending pga champion it was a lot more frustrating not to be competing and that hurts the most
3612090 marcamos 52 pardelas cenicienta algunas mediterr neas y otras de las azores de las que recuperamos 15 geolocalizadores con los que pudimos obtener los datos
3612091 aunque lo m s l gico es pensar que las aves vuelan por la costa de frica hacia el sur para llegar a namibia y sud frica observamos que se desviaban hacia brasil recorriendo 3 000 kil metros m s un 33 m s de su recorrido

3612103 sekali lagi philip morris international kedapatan melakukan pemasaran rokok yang menarik anak anak di negara berkembang dan itu tidak akan dibiarkan di amerika serikat dan negara maju lainnya
3612104 isu ini tidak hanya apakah philip morris international melanggar undang undang filipina tapi apakah perusahaan rokok seyogyanya dilibatkan dalam pemasaran berorientasi remaja di manapun juga philip morris international hendaknya segera menghentikan seluruh dukungan dan promosi di semua negara
3612105 are you allowed to come and go on a royal carribean cruise
3612106 the last three decades of my life scattered around my feet like cherry blossoms after a spring rain
3612107 the walls looked like they were moving sometimes there were so many bugs and roaches on the wall
3612108 when the door first opened roaches fell from the ceiling down to the floor so i knew then we were in for something
3612109 there was garbage packed up to the ceiling the smell was so overwhelming the investigator had to where a gas mask
3612110 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside

3612332 after he helped his side secure a well deserved 3 1 win over dundee united at new douglas park on monday mcarthur scored a controversial goal to put hamilton in front after tony stevensons free kick had cancelled out an own goal from mark mclaughlin the midfielder diverted mclaughlins header into the net with his hand as he tried to chest the ball home but united can have no complaints about the result reid admitted the game could not have gone any better and mcarthur was delighted to finally test himself in the top flight i was a wee bit nervous about how we were going to do as a team but as you saw we did well we had belief obviously but we didnt know what we were coming into we played last year against a few spl teams and we did okay but it was brilliant to finally get into the campaign as i said we were a wee bit apprehensive but we were keen to enjoy the occasion we have got a lot of belief and character in our dressing room as it showed out there it was great character coming back we were very unfortunate to lose the goal but we came back well and got the result we were looking for

3612337 well well well here we are kyle you tried to bail on our agreement but i found you
3612338 if milwaukee dramatically increases the number of kids who take the act well no longer be in the number one or two in the country were going to drop
3612339 if the state of wisconsin wants to be one or two in the act theyre going to have to figure out ways to help milwaukee kids do better
3612340 our college bound students performed very well on the act assessment outpacing their national peers
3612341 the school district of waukesha is very encouraged by our act scores
3612342 our students have continued to make gains and outperform the state average at the same time our participation has increased we will continue to focus on raising act scores
3612343 there are still far too many students who are graduating from high school without the skills they need to move to the next level
3612344 we need to improve the rigor of students experience in high school and those are our plans
3612345 we think that students should take rigorous coursework and obviously taking the act is a component of college preparation we support the idea of preparing for college and preparing for the work place
3612346 its important that we are not seeing a downward trend given the increased access
3612347 but i cant say that is more important than the work thats ahead of us which is to prepare far more kids for college readiness than we do now
3612348 farthest in there on the stony shore stands my poor wife at the cabin door and waits with our child for bread

3612353 the city councils decision to delay a decision on the plant for a couple weeks is a good one because i think there are a lot of questions
3612354 itd be really helpful for that information to come out and be reviewed
3612355 we were under the gun initially in our dealings with nacogdoches power to get council approval early in the month of august
3612356 that gave us those two weeks to have that town hall meeting and try to address their concerns
3612357 if they do it right it really is a very very clean source of electric power
3612358 at the same time they are not the only ones who want to build
3612359 the dynamic of it is ultimately depending on who is going to build first and how much total will be built
3612360 there are so many changes going on in the energy industry right now it would be a good idea for austin to get its priorities based on input from the people
3612361 i definitely want to act when we can control our destiny
3612362 this is a remarkable hedge against the volatility of fossil fuels pricing and whichever carbon regime is going to happen sooner rather than later

3612368 i was wondering if you had towelhead by alicia erian
3612369 i dont feel any pressure to pick a date harbaugh said after the teams first scrimmage of camp which was closed to the media and public
3612370 in terms of running the team all the little things harbaugh said
3612371 were not talking about a huge difference weve got three guys that we believe we can win with weve just got to train them all like theyre going to be the starter
3612372 some people look at this as almost a negative thing but its really not he said
3612373 its a positive thing to where our team is absolutely confident that whoever coach says is going to start aug 28 were going to have complete confidence in
3612374 at some point youve got to start narrowing down the first guy will take more reps than the second guy and the second guy will take more reps than the third guy but we run enough plays in practice where i feel
3612375 since practice six they have really made great strides all in different ways because theyre different harbaugh said
3612376 but weve been pushing the offensive tempo this camp and i think its going to help
3612377 these are good results against the background of the global credit crisis
3612378 affected by the economic slowdown with a number of major advertisers cutting back
3612379 there was a huge fight on july 18 at the romo home jessica and tony thought she was pregnant and happily announced it to the family

3612386 about 11am aest one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land
3612387 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle
3612388 we are looking into the possibility of the aircraft clipping powerlines
3612389 the aircraft was circling over the ocean to receive a standard damage check from the other hawk pilot
3612390 while circulating the aircraft was also burning off fuel to reduce its landing weight

3612397 this is the indonesian embassy and it was originally built by mister walsh now mister walsh came over from ireland without a penny in his pocket and he went to colorado and struck gold
3612398 were delighted because we think these images resonate very much with americans as well as canadians because theyre shared experiences through the last century of war peace and conflict and world celebrities and leaders
3612399 cultural events speak very much to a countrys values and project a nation as perhaps almost nothing else does you can have political discussions and you can have trade discussions but culture really demonstrates what a cultures values and iconic moments are all about
3612400 every time a decision is made the four of us have to agree every song you do is a series of decisions were a pretty democratic band where
3612401 dans le dernier virage jai voulu passer petit plateau et il y a eu un probl me dans le changement de vitesse
3612402 jai une sciatique survenue lors de la course sur route en raison de la pluie ma jambe gauche me tirait aujourdhui particuli rement dans la partie montante
3612403 failed to provide readers with an adequate understanding of this program and misrepresented the very spirit of the document
3612404 that catholics are called to form their consciences in order to exercise faithful citizenship
3612405 does not begin or end at the polling booth we are even told how to form our consciences beginning with a willingness and openness to seek the truth and what is right through the study of sacred scripture and the catechism of the catholic church and continuing with an examination of the background related to the choices before us we are told that forming our conscience also requires prayerful reflection to discern the will of god section 18
3612406 and yet nowhere in the article is the need to form ones conscience ever addressed instead readers are led to believe that they should vote on the basis of what they think or feel there is no reference to this active process catholics are instructed to perform the very essence of what it means to be a faithful citizen is omitted
3612407 is the compilation of general principles applied to the obligation that catholics have to exercise political responsibility in the light of their faith regardless of whether it is an election year and irrespective of the candidates who are running and the issues on which they are basing their campaigns
3612408 the times handling of the very delicate and complex challenge of voting also failed to represent the full scope of the bishops instructions the statement goes into great detail to emphasize that not all issues carry the same moral weight and that opposing intrinsically evil acts has a special claim on our consciences and our actions section 37 the document further cautions against the moral equivalence that makes no ethical distinctions between different kinds of issues involving human life and dignity the direct and intentional destruction of innocent human life from the moment of conception until natural death is always wrong and is not just one issue among many it must always be opposed section 28
3612409 why is it that anderson has not expelled the many pro abortion and pro homosexual politicians and members in the k of c and why do councils continue to rent their halls to them actions speak louder than words the danger to unborn children demands action not empty rhetoric
3612410 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
3612411 anderson was half right while the weakest go to the wall with 50 million babies aborted since roe v wade in 1973 the k of c have not really completely evolved into an action group to eliminate abortion anderson refuses to recognize that he and the order are a massive part of the abortion problem and that k of c politicians defeated an effort by a record 170 000 signatories to put traditional marriage on the ballot in massachusetts in 2008 not only that but out of state homosexuals can now marry in massachusetts and return to their home states to seek legal recognition because k of c politicians just recently helped repeal a massachusetts protect marriage law
3612412 anderson has led the k of c for nearly eight years he has happily followed in the footsteps of former supreme knight virgil dechant who told me in august 2005 that pro abortion politicians will never be expelled anderson dechant and supreme advocate paul devin who ruled unconstitutional a massachusetts state convention resolution by grand knight joe craven to suspend pro abortion and pro homosexual politicians must go to be taken seriously supreme chaplain bishop william lori and the other bishops must excommunicate the pro abortion and pro homosexual politicians and members

3612420 but weve been pushing the offensive tempo this camp and i think its going to help
3612421 i contacted several hotels and asked if cleaning and disinfecting the dresser drawers was on the cleaning checklist
3612422 we have seized the crane and the dogbox the crane is out of action
3612423 it is now an investigation its not a work site
3612424 the unions has made a few comments on what they thought of safety on the site so we will be sorting that out with them
3612425 i think youre going to find it will be very hard anywhere in town to book five or seven days in a row
3612426 there will be absolutely nothing available absolutely nothing already today we filled 12 rooms that was just bang weve only got seven rooms left out of 108 the doubles are 195 and the suite jacuzzi suite is 250

3612430 is so the truth and facts will be allowed to surface without the misuse of our words and biased opinions from mainstream local media
3612431 we will use this opportunity to happily clear up any doubts or uncertainties pertaining to our case the false allegations against us as well as the your black muslim bakery establishment
3612432 with all the biased reporting by the local mainstream can the bakery 4 bey and three other defendants in the kidnapping and torture case still receive a fair trial
3612433 i am not locked up on any charges connected to the death of chauncey bailey i would not be locked up now had the government not used the tragedy of chauncey bailey as a way to divert peoples attention from the false allegations i am presently being locked up for
3612434 i am not surprised when i see and hear the local media and newspapers try to connect myself and the bakery to the death of chauncey bailey as i have stated many times before myself nor the bakery had nothing to do with the chauncey bailey killing
3612435 as i have stated before i was never very fond of mr bailey but one thing he did not deserve was to be killed
3612436 this is a wonderful opportunity for norm to lead his own program in the most competitive division hockey league in the country
3612437 he s been a faithful and loyal tiger for more than eight years and his contributions to the hockey program and the athletic department have been nothing short of outstanding while we will miss him here he has certainly earned this opportunity
3612438 we will miss the friendships weve made on campus and in the wonderful community of
3612439 looking into the future im thrilled to have been given the opportunity to lead a program with as rich a tradition as in addition to the three wcha titles bazin was instrumental in guiding colorado college to six ncaa tournament appearances and more than 200 victories overall during the course of his career with the team
3612440 theyre trying to maximize their chances for admission to an institution
3612441 the two tests take very different approaches to what they measure
3612442 we often get comments from students that the act looks a lot more like what theyve learned in school
3612443 the act is a different test not a better one
3612444 like the sat the act remains a less accurate and less fair predictor of undergraduate performance than high school grades

3612450 it is not every day that 1 600 of your fellow compatriots are killed in cold blood
3612451 i think that its too early to make any final judgments because we are talking about a complicated situation
3612452 the aggressor has been punished and his military forces routed
3612453 i think russia is getting more nationalistic and i think its been strengthened in this reasserting of sovereignty
3612454 pelo menos 10 milicianos foram mortos nos ataques de acordo com nossas primeiras informa es

3612460 z majo sva veliko potovala tudi e prej ko e ni bila moja ena a tokratno predvsem pa najino poro no potovanje je bilo res nekaj najlep ega kar se nama je zgodilo v skupnih skoraj estih letih veze bilo je nepozabno in tudi romanti no
3612461 nam je ob povratku zaupal vidno ganjeni tajerski slav ek
3612462 son ni zahodi so bili res nekaj posebnega oba sva u ivala ob teh trenutkih privo ila sva si veliko po itka in e ve odli ne morske hrane tako da sva pripravljena na nove borbe skozi ivljenje predvsem zdaj ko e vedno poteka promocija plo e eden in edini
3612463 ogledala sva si tudi samoten zaliv kjer ljudje ivijo brez elektrike in vode
3612464 look at them they have the little bitty baby teeth
3612465 its as big a problem as doping it is more blatant cheating than doping its a slap in the face to the whole world shame on them but theres nothing you can do about it
3612466 the only thing they can do is abolish the age limit
3612467 more than half of ischemic strokes 52 percent in men and 54 percent in women may have been prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle he added that the present study showed that following a healthy lifestyle which has been associated with up to 80 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and 90 percent lower risk of diabetes may also prevent more than half of ischemic strokes
3612468 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3612469 the israeli siege has turned gaza into a big prison we cannot leave not even for medical care or to study abroad and most of what we need is not available in gaza we are not living really we are barely surviving and the outlook for the future is bleak
3612470 the collective punishment of the population of gaza which has been instituted for months now has failed
3612471 we appreciate bafanas interest in our players but sundowns will not release any player for the national team because we need them for the local knockout competition
3612472 there is a lot at stake in this tournament so we want our best players to be available
3612473 that is a matter of the the clubs and safa to address
3612474 they are the ones that have scheduled a match that is not on a day which is sanctioned for international fixtures
3612475 its a fifa sanctioned week and clubs will have to allow players to be available for the national team 48 hours before the game
3612476 this is how we pray we kneel on the ground close our eyes and put our hands together then we ask god to forgive mum for all that she has done for leaving us we pray for no nightmares and only for good dreams amen
3612477 full gospel business men international dinner so my sister catherine and myself and maybe my brother too were dropped off at your mums house so that we were looked after that evening although i wanted to stay with my parents
3612478 what happens if my story isnt true or no one believes me
3612479 the walls looked like they were moving sometimes there were so many bugs and roaches on the wall
3612480 when the door first opened roaches fell from the ceiling down to the floor so i knew then we were in for something
3612481 there was garbage packed up to the ceiling the smell was so overwhelming the investigator had to where a gas mask
3612482 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside
3612483 chicken and chips was pretty much their diet there was evidence of some other things in there like old pizza boxes but from what i understand those were his and the kids and her were not allowed to partake
3612484 from what i understand he just left and didnt come back and she got word somehow i dont know what happened but she got word somehow that he got involved with another lady
3612485 nobody in this community knew that he had children or a wife thats whats so strange about this this family was so afraid of this man that he said they are not to leave and they did not leave
3612486 he was always talking to my son and to my boyfriend just being normal like normal people do
3612487 to get around this i found that ssh root localhost works until su is fixed
3612488 le plus grand probl me de l conomie am ricaine et europ nne cest quil est en train de sop rer une perte de richesse en d faveur des pays d velopp s et au profit des pays producteurs de p trole
3612489 vouloir adapter son raffinage pour maitriser ses exc dents dessence en europe
3612490 loscar et resol la vida fins i tot perdent lo
3612491 im just at the grocery store and im not in pearl jam
3612492 was not hillarys supporter never not ever not for a day
3612493 that may be by the time he got through working on it that was probably true
3612494 thats easily to be understood from his comments and i just beg to differ with that because the fact of the matter is all the stuff that i saw reported were reports on things the president said from his own mouth
3612495 most people thought that the most telling thing back in january was the equation that the president made of jesse jackson having won south carolina caucuses 20 years earlier and compared that with obama winning the south carolina primary theres a big difference in a caucus and a primary
3612496 and so a lot of that irrespective of what the president may have meant by the statement a lot of people interpreted that as having a racial connotation and jim clyburn didnt speak on that issue at all
3612497 i dont know that ive done any surveys to determine whether or not the president former president has ever damaged himself or not
3612498 my gut tells me that some things i ought to keep to myself
3612499 its not that the procedures or the birthing process are that much different
3612500 you give any of these people a written exam and theyd be in the 90th percentile
3612501 were not talking about high fidelity training and thats the beauty
3612502 there are times when a birth is going to happen when there arent any physicians
3612503 whats the point of only training physicians if there arent any around
3612504 you can call and get your results or just hers pointing to lillian you dont have to get yours i probably wouldnt if i were doing the test
3612505 its a very crowded marketplace when we opened rush hour 2 on aug 3 2001 there was far less competition
3612506 i think shes someone who has had to function in that world in spite of who she is
3612507 i think she has an underlying sort of volcanic personality thats not maybe immediately evident when you see her but i think because shes grieving shes kind of stifled a lot and i think it comes out in little spurts she has a little bit of violence to her and i dont know if i think shes tough necessarily i think shes a little bit violent i think she can actually be really passive and i think she was sort of buoyed here into this life i think she makes decisions but she also kind of goes with where she is taken
3612508 i like all those scenes actually i like them a lot i like them because to see her its so incongruous to see this woman that looks this particular way sort of functioning with the gangsters i find it really interesting actually
3612509 some going and some yet to be discovered i dont think its actually a love life because i think she doesnt necessarily lead with her heart generally so theres a little wall there i think its mostly more like sex life really but she gets some over there so i dont think im allowed to say who am i i sleep with many people and its great
3612510 in very clear terms they said this is the last warning the government is going to shut all of these clubs down and the government is going to prosecute anyone involved
3612511 ive got 20 employees with salary and health benefits most of them with families who are going to be out of work in a crappy economy
3612512 i was basically being told by the doj that i better get them out and get them out in a hurry or else
3612513 for years it wasnt a problem but now all of a sudden the same day the feds come to talk to my landlord it is
3612514 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3612515 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3612516 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3612517 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore

3612527 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3612528 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3612529 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3612530 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal

3612537 the courts ruling has cut out the core of scos case and as a result eliminates scos threat to the linux community based upon allegations of copyright infringement of unix
3612538 following this ruling it looks as if scos case against ibm is all but over and cios can continue with their linux adoption plans without any further fears at least as far as this issue is concerned

3612562 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3612563 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3612564 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3612565 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3612566 its been a while since coach mike nolan has said anything to us about it
3612567 i wish we were in the light a little bit i guess thats how it is
3612568 emotional roller coaster as well as a professional roller coaster
3612569 hes a little more relaxed and comfortable with what were doing the other guys will come along

3612577 ive never been in a training camp where this many receivers went down

3612585 i dont remember the last time a horrible crime by a single person evoked such a collective apology
3612586 as if the killing werent bad enough it was one of our children who did it
3612587 we have a very strong geopolitical connection with one another and there is a feeling that we are all related by blood
3612588 i think the apologies stem from this feeling that we didnt take good care of one of our own
3612589 because korean americans are a very small minority we have this kind of feeling of being responsible for all our brothers
3612590 that fear that koreans had please let him be some other asian is a direct response to the racial politics of our nation
3612591 if someone who is not white commits this kind of horrific crime then our racial politics says that this becomes a stigma on the entire racial collective if a white person commits a crime well then its an individual thing they blame it on the specific perpetrators the subculture their marginalization but it is not a reflection of white americans at large
3612592 this young man needed help but did not get it for whatever reason and he just became an extreme example of the worst in all of us whether were korean white latino or black
3612593 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3612594 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3612595 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3612596 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3612597 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3612598 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3612599 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3612604 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3612605 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3612606 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3612607 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3612615 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3612616 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3612617 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3612618 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3612619 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3612620 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3612621 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3612622 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3612623 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3612624 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3612625 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3612626 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3612627 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3612628 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3612629 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3612630 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3612631 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3612632 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3612633 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3612634 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3612635 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3612636 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3612637 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3612638 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3612639 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3612640 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3612641 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3612642 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3612643 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3612644 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3612645 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3612646 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3612647 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3612648 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3612649 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3612650 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3612651 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3612652 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3612653 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3612654 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3612655 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3612656 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3612657 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3612658 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3612659 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3612667 no one ever won a chess game by betting on each move sometimes you have to move backward to get a step forward
3612668 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3612669 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3612670 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3612702 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3612703 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3612704 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3612705 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3612706 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3612707 just so you all know we did set a record
3612708 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3612709 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3612710 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3612711 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3612712 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3612713 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3612714 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3612715 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3612716 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3612717 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3612718 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3612719 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3612720 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3612721 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3612722 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3612723 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3612724 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3612725 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3612726 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3612727 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3612728 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3612729 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3612730 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3612731 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3612732 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3612733 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3612734 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3612735 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3612736 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3612737 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3612738 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3612739 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3612740 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3612741 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3612742 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3612743 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3612744 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3612745 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3612746 i didnt swoop in i came in the same way everybody else did
3612747 well now im telling you to open the ward window and climb out of there before they give you a pre frontal lobotomy and i have to come in and smother you with a pillow
3612748 no podemos atribuirle a la contaminaci n el desempe o de durante la carrera porque las condiciones de calor casi 40 grados y la lluvia nos afect a todos tanto a los ganadores como a los perdedores
3612749 pero definitivamente las europeas fueron mejores que nosotras en la carrera y por eso conquistaron la medallas
3612750 quienes hablan de fracaso en estos momentos cuando todav a quedan m s del 80 por ciento de nuestro atletas en beijing no saben lo que dicen los que critican nuestra actuaci n hablan por hablar no tienen ni idea del trabajo que hacemos los sacrificios que afrontamos para representar al pa s y estar metido entre los mejores cincuenta del mundo
3612751 que se mantengan en pie de lucha que no abandonen y piensen en su patria y en los millones que les apoyan que no permitan que por una minor a interesada y desconocedora de la realidad deportiva puedan verse afectada su rendimiento
3612752 estamos con la frente en alto igual que cuando desfilamos cuando pedaleamos y ahora que estamos de retorno en nuestra patria al lado de los nuestros amigos familiares y personas que nos aprecian y que si reconocen el esfuerzo realzado
3612753 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3612754 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3612755 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3612756 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3612757 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3612758 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3612759 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3612760 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3612761 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3612762 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3612763 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3612764 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3612765 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3612766 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3612767 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3612768 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3612769 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3612770 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3612771 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3612772 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3612773 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3612774 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3612775 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3612776 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3612777 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3612778 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3612779 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3612780 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3612781 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3612782 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3612783 estamos insatisfechos con las decisiones de los rbitros sus fallos ensombrecieron el partido
3612784 a pesar que los dos equipos son de similar nivel de competencias por las injustas decisiones de los rbitros en los puntos cr ticos hemos perdido el partido
3612785 se trat de un juego muy interesante pienso que hemos jugado nuestro mejor partido cuando el equipo perd a no se dio por vencido y luch hasta el final me siento muy feliz y agradezco a todos los fans chinos por el apoyo que nos dieron

3612788 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3612789 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3612790 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims

3612794 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3612795 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3612796 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3612797 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3612798 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3612799 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3612800 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3612801 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3612802 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3612803 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
3612804 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3612805 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3612806 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3612807 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3612808 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3612809 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3612810 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3612811 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3612812 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3612813 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3612814 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3612815 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3612816 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3612817 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3612818 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3612819 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3612820 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3612821 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3612822 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3612823 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
3612824 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3612825 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3612826 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3612827 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3612828 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3612829 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3612830 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3612831 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3612832 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3612833 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3612834 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3612835 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3612836 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3612837 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3612838 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3612839 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3612840 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3612841 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3612842 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3612843 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3612844 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3612845 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3612846 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3612847 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
3612848 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3612849 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3612850 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3612851 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3612852 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3612853 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3612854 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3612855 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3612856 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3612857 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3612858 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3612859 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3612860 from a marketing point of view you dont introduce new products in august
3612861 we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
3612862 covert attempts to mold opinion through the undisclosed use of third parties
3612863 participants were instructed not to quote their briefers directly or otherwise describe their contacts with the pentagon
3612864 it was them saying we need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you
3612865 no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the united states not heretofore authorized by the congress
3612866 the failure of an agency to identify itself as the source of a prepackaged news story misleads the viewing public by encouraging the viewing audience to believe that the broadcasting news organization developed the information the prepackaged news stories are purposefully designed to be indistinguishable from news segments broadcast to the public when the television viewing public does not know that the stories they watched on television news programs about the government were in fact prepared by the government the stories are in this sense no longer purely factual the essential fact of attribution is missing
3612867 over the years gao has interpreted publicity or propaganda restrictions to preclude use of appropriated funds for among other things so called covert propaganda
3612868 look i didnt know look i think that you guys should take a step back and look at this look dod has made a decision theyve decided to stop this program but i would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something and i dont think that that should be against the law and i think that its absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and are going to be providing their opinions on it it doesnt necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration i think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration that doesnt mean that we shouldnt talk to people
3612869 scant credible evidence that iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al qaeda
3612870 saddams regime is intensely secular and is wary of islamic revolutionary movements moreover baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control
3612871 in desperation saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al qaeda
3612872 sporadic wary contacts with al qaeda since the mid 1990s rather than a relationship with al qaeda that has developed over time
3612873 if iraq regimes sic continues to defy us and the world we will move deliberately yet decisively to hold iraq to account its a new world were in we used to think two oceans could separate us from an enemy on that tragic day september the 11th 2001 we found out thats not the case we found out this great land of liberty and of freedom and of justice is vulnerable and therefore we must do everything we can everything we can to secure the homeland to make us safe
3612874 with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons our own options to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies then the attacks of september 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors
3612875 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on that terrible morning 19 evil men the shock troops of a hateful ideology gave america and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions they imagined in the words of one terrorist that september the 11th would be the beginning of the end of america by seeking to turn our cities into killing fields terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nations resolve and force our retreat from the world they have failed
3612876 now were in a new and unprecedented war against violent islamic extremists this is an ideological conflict we face against murderers and killers who try to impose their will these are the people that attacked us on september the 11th and killed nearly 3 000 people the stakes are high and once again we have had to change our strategic thinking the major battleground in this war is iraq
3612877 we know that iraq and al qaeda have had high level contacts that go back a decade some al qaeda leaders who fled afghanistan went to iraq these include one very senior al qaeda leader who received medical treatment in baghdad this year and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks weve learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases
3612878 w e we need to think about saddam hussein using al qaeda to do his dirty work to not leave fingerprints behind
3612879 evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of al qaeda secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own
3612880 w hat i want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between iraq and the al qaeda terrorist network a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder
3612881 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on t he liberation of iraq removed an ally of al qaeda
3612882 report on whether public statements regarding iraq by u s government officials were substantiated by intelligence information
3612883 statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that iraq and had a partnership or that iraq had provided with weapons training were not substantiated by the intelligence
3612884 the intelligence community did not confirm that muhammad atta met an iraqi intelligence officer in prague in 2001 as the vice president repeatedly claimed
3612885 a substantial amount of iraqs chemical warfare agents precursors munitions and production equipment were destroyed between 1991 and 1998 as a result of operation desert storm and unscom actions t here is no reliable information on whether iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or whether iraq has or will establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities
3612886 t he notion of a saddam hussein with his great oil wealth with his inventory that he already has of biological and chemical weapons is i think a frightening proposition for anybody who thinks about it
3612887 in defiance of the united nations iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons and is rebuilding the facilities used to make more of those weapons
3612888 all the world has now seen the footage of an iraqi mirage aircraft with a fuel tank modified to spray biological agents over wide areas iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on unmanned aerial vehicles with ranges far beyond what is permitted by the security council a uav launched from a vessel off the american coast could reach hundreds of miles inland
3612889 the iraqi report also failed to deal with issues which have arisen since 1998 including attempts to acquire uranium and the means to enrich it
3612890 the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
3612891 we do know that there have been shipments going into iraq of aluminum tubes that really are only suited to high quality aluminum tools sic that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs centrifuge programs
3612892 our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production
3612893 h e has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries even after inspections resumed by now just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion there is controversy about what these tubes are for most us experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium
3612894 report on whether public statements regarding iraq by u s government officials were substantiated by intelligence information
3612895 statements by the president and vice president prior to the october 2002 national intelligence estimate regarding iraqs chemical weapons production capability and activities did not reflect the intelligence communitys uncertainties as to whether such production was ongoing
3612896 the secretary of defenses statement that the iraqi government operated underground wmd facilities that were not vulnerable to conventional airstrikes because they were underground and deeply buried was not substantiated by available intelligence information
3612897 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
3612898 states such as these iraq iran and north korea and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger they could provide these arms to terrorists giving them the means to match their hatred they could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the united states in any of these cases the price of indifference would be catastrophic
3612899 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction he is amassing them to use against our friends our enemies and against us
3612900 the history the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion saddam husseins regime is a grave and gathering danger to suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence to assume this regimes good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble and this is a risk we must not take
3612901 n o terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of saddam hussein and iraq
3612902 on its present course the iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency it has developed weapons of mass death
3612903 but the president also believes that this problem has to be dealt with and if the united nations wont deal with it then the united states with other likeminded nations may have to deal with it we would prefer not to go that route but the danger is so great with respect to saddam hussein having weapons of mass destruction and perhaps even terrorists getting hold of such weapons that it is time for the international community to act and if it doesnt act the president is prepared to act with likeminded nations
3612904 today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent threat posed by iraq a dictator who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or possess those weapons we will not permit saddam hussein to blackmail and or terrorize nations which love freedom
3612905 but the risk of doing nothing the risk of the security of this country being jeopardized at the hands of a madman with weapons of mass destruction far exceeds the risk of any action we may be forced to take
3612906 report on whether public statements regarding iraq by u s government officials were substantiated by intelligence information
3612907 statements by the president and the vice president indicating that saddam hussein was prepared to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against the united states were contradicted by available intelligence information
3612908 authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of 2002
3612909 whereas iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations
3612910 whereas members of al qaeda an organization bearing responsibility for attacks on the united states its citizens and interests including the attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 are known to be in iraq
3612911 b presidential determination in connection with the exercise of the authority granted in subsection a to use force the president shall prior to such exercise or as soon thereafter as may be feasible but no later than 48 hours after exercising such authority make available to the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate his determination that 1 reliance by the united states on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either a will not adequately protect the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq or b is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq and 2 acting pursuant to this joint resolution is consistent with the united states and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorist and terrorist organizations including those nations organizations or persons who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
3612912 one question for you both do you believe that there is a link between saddam hussein a direct link and the men who attacked on september the 11th
3612913 i could find no evidence of links between iraq and al qaeda the documentation and interviews indicated that al qaeda regarded saddam a secular leader as an infidel
3612914 weve been looking at this hard for more than a year and you know what we just dont think its there
3612915 nothing in this joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the war powers resolution
3612916 the president is authorized to use the armed forces of the united states as he deems necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq
3612917 this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land
3612918 3 all members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered
3612919 4 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations
3612920 51 nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security
3612921 i directed u s armed forces operating with other coalition forces to commence combat operations on march 19 2003 against iraq
3612922 i have indicated it was not in conformity with the un charter from our point of view from the charter point of view it was illegal
3612923 a broken arm a broken thigh and a dislocated ankle
3612924 used me to symbolize all this stuff its wrong i dont know why they filmed my rescue or why they say these things i did not shoot not a round nothing i went down praying to my knees and thats the last i remember
3612925 right after my capture tales of great heroism were being told my parents home in wirt county was under siege of the media all repeating the story of the little girl rambo from the hills who went down fighting it was not true i am still confused as to why they chose to lie
3612926 authorizes funding for the defense of the united states and its interests abroad for military construction and for national security related energy programs
3612927 provisions of the act including sections 841 846 1079 and 1222 purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the presidents ability to carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that the laws be faithfully executed to protect national security to supervise the executive branch and to execute his authority as commander in chief the executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president
3612928 should be opened to international oil companies as quickly as possible after the war
3612929 the country should establish a conducive business environment to attract investment of oil and gas resources
3612930 by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional 50 million barrels a day
3612931 in a january 29 2001 memorandum the president established nepdg the national energy policy development group comprised of the vice president nine cabinet level officials and four other senior administration officials to gather information deliberate and make recommendations to the president by the end of fiscal year 2001 the president called on the vice president to chair the group direct its work and as necessary establish subordinate working groups to assist nepdg
3612932 other senior administration officials were the director of the office of management and budget the assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for policy the assistant to the president for economic policy and the deputy assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs
3612933 in developing the national energy policy report the nepdg principals support group and participating agency officials and staff met with solicited input from or received information and advice from nonfederal energy stakeholders principally petroleum coal nuclear natural gas and electricity industry representatives and lobbyists
3612934 none of the key federal entities involved in the nepdg effort provided gao with a complete accounting of the costs that they incurred during the development of the national energy policy report the two federal entities responsible for funding the nepdg effort ovp and the department of energy doe did not provide the comprehensive cost information that gao requested ovp provided gao with 77 pages of information two thirds of which contained no cost information while the remaining one third contained some miscellaneous information of little to no usefulness ovp stated that it would not provide any additional information doe the department of the interior and the environmental protection agency epa provided gao with estimates of certain costs and salaries associated with the nepdg effort but these estimates all calculated in different ways were not comprehensive
3612935 iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas reserves id love chevron to have access to
3612936 to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment
3612937 from the beginning the administration adopted a flawed contracting approach in iraq
3612938 even after the administration claimed it was awarding iraq contracts competitively in early 2004 real price competition was missing
3612939 in the absence of price competition rigorous government oversight becomes essential for accountability
3612940 under halliburtons two largest iraq contracts pentagon auditors found 1 billion in questioned costs and over 400 million in unsupported costs
3612941 despite the spending of billions of taxpayer dollars u s reconstruction efforts in keys sectors of the iraqi economy are failing over two years after the u s led invasion of iraq oil and electricity production has fallen below pre war levels the administration has failed to even measure how many iraqis lack access to drinkable water
3612942 bunnatine greenhouse was the chief contracting officer at the army corps of engineers the agency that has managed much of the reconstruction work in iraq
3612943 the most blatant and improper contract abuse i have witnessed during the course of my professional career
3612944 on august 27 2005 the army demoted ms greenhouse removing her from the elite senior executive service and transferring her to a lesser job in the corps civil works division as frank rich of the new york times described the situation h er crime was not obstructing justice but pursuing it by vehemently questioning irregularities in the awarding of some 7 billion worth of no bid contracts in iraq to the halliburton subsidiary kellogg brown root the demotion was in apparent retaliation for her speaking out against the abuses even though she previously had stellar reviews and over 20 years of experience in military procurement
3612945 the administrations domestic contracting record is no better than its record on iraq waste fraud and abuse appear to be the rule rather than the exception
3612946 a transportation security administration tsa cost plus contract with ncs pearson inc
3612947 the administration is spending 239 million on the integrated surveillance and intelligence system a no bid contract to provide thousands of cameras and sensors to monitor activity on the mexican and canadian borders
3612948 the tsa awarded boeing a cost plus contract to install over 1 000 explosive detection systems for airline passenger luggage
3612949 the fbi spent 170 million on a virtual case file system that does not operate as required after three years of work under a cost plus contract failed to produce a functional system the fbi scrapped the program and began work on the new sentinel case file system
3612950 the department of homeland security inspector general found that taxpayer dollars were being lavished on perks for agency officials one ig report found that tsa spent over 400 000 on its first leaders executive office suite another found that tsa spent 350 000 on a gold plated gym
3612951 according to news reports pentagon auditors examined a contract between the transportation security administration tsa and unisys a technology and consulting company for the upgrade of airport computer networks among other irregularities government auditors found that unisys may have overbilled for as much as 171 000 hours of labor and overtime by charging for employees at up to twice their actual rate of compensation while the cost ceiling for the contract was set at 1 billion unisys has reportedly billed the government 940 million with more than half of the seven year contract remaining and more than half of the tsa monitored airports still lacking upgraded networks
3612952 serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily function or even death
3612953 interrogations undertaken pursuant to the presidents commander in chief powers
3612954 necessity or self defense could provide justifications that would eliminate any criminal liability
3612955 no physical or mental torture nor any other form of coercion may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened insulted or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind
3612956 must have some status under international law he is either a prisoner of war and as such covered by the third convention or a civilian covered by the fourth convention there is no intermediate status nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law
3612957 encourage populations dominated by terrorist organizations or their supporters to overthrow that domination
3612958 foodstuffs economic assistance medical supplies and russian military equipment some of it funneled through nonprofit groups
3612959 it appears to us that there was never any legitimate basis for the purely legal analysis contained in this document to be classified in the first place
3612960 in addition to this opinion however the yoo memorandum references at least 10 other olc opinions on weighty matters of great interest to the american people that also do not appear to have been released
3612961 indeed a recent court filing by the department in foia litigation involving the central intelligence agency identifies 8 additional secret olc opinions dating from august 6 2004 to february 18 2007 given that these reflect only olc memoranda identified in the files of the cia and based on the sampling procedures under which that listing was generated it appears that these represent only a small portion of the secret olc memoranda generated during this time with the true number almost certainly much higher
3612962 it is a basic tenet of democracy that the people have a right to know the law
3612963 a legal interpretation by the justice departments office of legal counsel
3612964 these executive branch precedents are law for the executive branch
3612965 another body of secret law is the controlling interpretations of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that are issued by the foreign intelligence surveillance court
3612966 the administrations shroud of secrecy extends to agency rules and executive pronouncements such as executive orders that carry the force of law through the diligent efforts of my colleague senator whitehouse we have learned that olc has taken the position that a president can waive or modify a published executive order without any notice to the public or congress simply by not following it
3612967 whoever except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the constitution or act of congress willfully uses any part of the army or the air force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years or both
3612968 kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures
3612969 affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power
3612970 quarter ed large bodies of armed troops among us protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states
3612971 conduct surveillance and operate detection equipment work with border entry identification teams analyze information assist with communications and give administrative support to the border patrol
3612972 law enforcement officers need a federal judges permission to wiretap a foreign terrorists phone or to track his calls or to search his property officers must meet strict standards to use any of the tools were talking about
3612973 months after the sept 11 attacks president bush secretly authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on americans and others inside the united states to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying according to government officials
3612974 i have reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the september the 11th attacks and i intend to do so for as long as our nation faces a continuing threat from al qaeda and related groups the nsas activities under this authorization are thoroughly reviewed by the justice department and nsas top legal officials including nsas general counsel and inspector general leaders in congress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this authorization and the activities conducted under it
3612975 we have had discussions with congress in the past certain members of congress as to whether or not fisa could be amended to allow us to adequately deal with this kind of threat and we were advised that that would be difficult if not impossible
3612976 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
3612977 the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 unambiguously limits warrantless domestic electronic surveillance even in a congressionally declared war to the first 15 days of that war criminalizes any such electronic surveillance not authorized by statute and expressly establishes fisa and two chapters of the federal criminal code governing wiretaps for intelligence purposes and for criminal investigation respectively as the
3612978 our position is is that the authorization to use force which was passed by the congress in the days following september 11th constitutes that other authorization that other statute by congress to engage in this kind of signals intelligence
3612979 from the foregoing analysis it appears unlikely that a court would hold that congress has expressly or impliedly authorized the nsa electronic surveillance operations here under discussion and it would likewise appear that to the extent that those surveillances fall within the definition of
3612980 presidential authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information
3612981 the inescapable conclusion is that the aumf did not implicitly authorize what the fisa expressly prohibited it follows that the presidential program of surveillance at issue here is a violation of the separation of powers as grave an abuse of executive authority as i can recall ever having studied
3612982 nsa program to wiretap the international communications of some americans without a court warrant violated the constitution judge taylor ruled that the program violated both the fourth amendment and a 1978 law that requires warrants from a secret court for intelligence wiretaps involving people in the united states she rejected the administrations repeated assertions that a 2001 congressional authorization and the presidents constitutional authority allowed the program
3612983 the stored communications act of 1986 sca prohibits the knowing disclosure of customer telephone records to the government unless pursuant to subpoena warrant or a national security letter or other administrative subpoena with the customers lawful consent or there is a business necessity or an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury none of these exceptions apply to the circumstance described in the usa today story
3612984 the national security agency has been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of americans using data provided by at amp t verizon and bellsouth
3612985 the agencys goal is to create a database of every call ever made within the nations borders
3612986 widespread instances of intimidation and misinformation in violation of the voting rights act the civil rights act of 1968 equal protection due process and the ohio right to vote
3612987 no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws
3612988 hurricane intensity has increased with oceanic surface temperatures over the past 30 years the physics of hurricane intensity growth has clarified and explained the thermodynamic basis for these observations kerry emanuel has tested this relationship and presented convincing evidence
3612989 most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks perhaps longer at least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure power outages will last for weeks water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards
3612990 a homeland security department report submitted to the white house at 1 47 a
3612991 i dont think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees
3612992 the situation is past critical estimates are many will die within hours
3612993 thanks for the update anything specific i need to do or tweak
3612994 most of observed warming over last 50 years is likely due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities
3612995 increase threats to human health particularly in lower income populations predominantly within tropical subtropical countries
3612996 explores how such an abrupt climate change scenario could potentially de stabilize the geo political environment leading to skirmishes battles and even war due to resource constraints such as 1 food shortages due to decreases in net global agricultural production 2 decreased availability and quality of fresh water in key regions due to shifted precipitation patters causing more frequent floods and droughts 3 disrupted access to energy supplies due to extensive sea ice and storminess
3612997 remarkably none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position
3612998 in august 2003 the bush administration denied a petition to regulate co2 emissions from motor vehicles by deciding that co2 was not a pollutant under the clean air act
3612999 if epa makes a finding of endangerment the clean air act requires the agency to regulate emissions of the deleterious pollutant from new motor vehicles
3613000 the record before the committee shows 1 the career staff at epa unanimously supported granting californias petition to be allowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks consistent with california state law 2 stephen johnson the administrator of epa also supported granting californias petition at least in part and 3 administrator johnson reversed his position after communications with officials in the white house
3613001 at climate laboratories of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for example many scientists who routinely took calls from reporters five years ago can now do so only if the interview is approved by administration officials in washington and then only if a public affairs officer is present or on the phone
3613002 the evidence before the committee leads to one inescapable conclusion the bush administration has engaged in a systematic effort to manipulate climate change science and mislead policy makers and the public about the dangers of global warming
3613003 there was a systematic white house effort to minimize the significance of climate change by editing climate change reports ceq chief of staff phil cooney and other ceq officials made at least 294 edits to the administrations strategic plan of the climate change science program to exaggerate or emphasize scientific uncertainties or to de emphasize or diminish the importance of the human role in global warming
3613004 almost 1 600 epa scientists completed the union of concerned scientists survey questionnaire over 22 percent of these scientists reported that selective or incomplete use of data to justify a specific regulatory outcome occurred frequently or occasionally at epa ninety four epa scientists reported being frequently or occasionally directed to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information from an epa scientific document nearly 200 epa scientists said that they have frequently or occasionally been in situations in which scientists have actively objected to resigned from or removed themselves from a project because of pressure to change scientific findings

3613009 patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york
3613010 a call to our embassy in the uae in may saying that a group of bin laden supporters was in the us planning attacks with explosives
3613011 in a single 17 sentence document the intelligence briefing delivered to president bush in august 2001 spells out the who hints at the what and points towards the where of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington that followed 36 days later
3613012 reiterated a consistent and constant theme osama bin ladens intent to launch terrorist attacks inside the united states
3613013 the attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against u s facilities or interests attack preparations have been made attack will occur with little or no warning
3613014 information coming out in the press and in other ways
3613015 my report to the nation is weve got the best intelligence we can possibly have thanks to the men and women of the c i a
3613016 a few weeks after the august 6 pdb was delivered i followed it to crawford to make sure that the president stayed current on events
3613017 george tenet and i yesterday we piled in the new nominees for the chairman of the joint chiefs the vice chairman and their wives and went right up the canyon
3613018 i need to report that according to the white house and the director of central intelligence the presidents knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified even when the substance of the intelligence information has been declassified
3613019 epas response to the world trade center collapse challenges successes and areas for improvement
3613020 w hen epa made a september 18 announcement that the air was safe to breathe it did not have sufficient data and analyses to make such a blanket statement at that time air monitoring data was lacking for several pollutants of concern including particulate matter and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs furthermore the white house council on environmental quality ceq influenced through the collaboration process the information that epa communicated to the public through its early press releases when it convinced epa to add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones
3613021 as a result of the white house ceqs influence guidance for cleaning indoor spaces and information about the potential health effects from wtc debris were not included in epa issued press releases
3613022 all statements to the media should be cleared through the nsc national security council before they are released
3613023 according to the epa chief of staff one particular ceq official was designated to work with epa to ensure that clearance was obtained through nsc the associate administrator for the epa office of communications education and media relations ocemr said that no press release could be issued for a 3 to 4 week period after september 11 without approval from the ceq contact
3613024 i think that the thinking was these are experts in wmd weapons of mass destruction so they should have the coordinating role
3613025 both upper and lower respiratory problems and mental health difficulties are widespread among rescue and recovery workers who dug through the ruins of the world trade center in the days following its destruction in the attack of september 11 2001
3613026 an analysis of the screenings of 1 138 workers and volunteers who responded to the world trade center disaster found that nearly three quarters of them experienced new or worsened upper respiratory problems at some point while working at ground zero and half of those examined had upper and or lower respiratory symptoms that persisted up to the time of their examinations an average of eight months after their wtc efforts ended
3613027 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3613028 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3613029 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3613030 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3613031 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3613032 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3613033 yes i did and because of that i can decide who giggles and who doesnt

3613042 dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
3613043 while there was a marginal increase in the numbers of students that sat the higher paper in maths this year when you take into account the fact that more students sat the leaving certificate this year compared with last year the numbers are disappointing
3613044 for the past number of years the high failure rate in maths and the small numbers choosing to take higher level has made the headlines it is time to stop posturing and tackle the problem head on radical solutions must be introduced immediately
3613045 ireland needs high levels of achievement in science and technology and to realise this a sea change in how we teach how we resource and how we deal with these courses is needed fianna f il has failed to meet the challenges posed by falling participation rates and achievement in maths and the sciences
3613046 its been a very warm embrace by people from the act and people wanting to go to the nations capital

3613055 we dont have a lot more time to flounder around thats as simple as it is
3613056 that was bush league in my opinion hes battling some soreness it was noticeable tonight
3613057 weve let too many games like that get away it was set up perfecto for us but we just didnt get the job done
3613058 were getting him checked out enough is enough its not his fault but it looks to me like hes having a problem finishing pitches
3613059 i know hes not right i dont know that hes hurt for sure but hes definitely not right
3613060 but he hasnt made many starts and he was up over 100 pitches
3613061 usually its sept 1 if youre two or three games out
3613062 being that were eight back its crunch time for us now but im being positive i still think and will think that were in the hunt
3613063 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3613064 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team
3613065 imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester pitching is 70 percent of the game wang won 19 games two straight years chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3613066 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
3613067 the rays in the meantime were contacted by the t ian casselberry
3613068 if sheffield is indeed back to normal the tigers lineup all of a sudde ian casselberry
3613069 not many guys can get on top of that first one he hit a 96 mph fastball and hit it that far what an encouraging sign that was
3613070 my arm is feeling great but i need to throw innings
3613071 they have good players a great team and great fans
3613072 its a minor league contract with no major league commitments
3613073 theres nothing to lose on our part we scouted him watched him throw at the university of miami and liked him we thought he threw well but feel he needs continued improvement in his arm strength
3613074 as you know hes thrown harder than that in the past i have no idea how long it will take for him to come back
3613075 we told dontrelle that our goal with him is that wed like him to be ready and to be the good big league pitcher that hes capable of being in 2009 if its before that great
3613076 the last two times out for lakeland hes thrown strikes his arm strength is there his breaking ball has been solid so well just see what happens
3613077 but in the unlikely story that is america there has never been anything false about hope
3613078 if you put my number of games up to brett favres whats more impressive
3613079 well favres playing quarterback thats why i dont get wrapped up in it
3613080 for everyone who says youre the longest someones going to say youre a kicker who cares

3613082 to me hes the ultimate pro the absolute ultimate pro
3613083 he is so physically tuned he got a pattern to everything he does his prep is phenomenal
3613084 we brought him in and talked to him to see where hes at
3613085 if you get a group together on game day and somebody goes down somebody has to be able to adjust
3613086 i really like rod marinelli and what he preaches and

3613091 if i was a coach and i just had one quarterback i felt i could win with id be really nervous
3613092 i hope its a situation where we have confidence in both of them and whoever is starting against utah that we wouldnt hesitate to put the other guy in at times
3613093 i have not been a guy who has a set thing ok this guy comes in the third series or whatever
3613094 put a guy in the game and hes supposed to perform and play it by ear ive never scripted even when ive had two guys who are good enough to win with ive never done certain series its a feel thing
3613095 the biggest drawback as freshmen coming in is can they mentally handle the schemes and the pace those two have shown they can so far
3613096 i thought coming in there would be upwards 9 or 10 true freshmen that have an opportunity to play and thats probably going to be the case
3613097 our goal is to build our walk on program to be the best in the country

3613108 tuan mungkin telah berjumpa dengan anak saya ia anak yang baik walau ia tak mengerti sepenuhnya alasan saya tapi ia tetap membantu karena tak ingin saya mengerjakan semuanya sendirian
3613109 tuan saya memang tidak berniat untuk merasakan manfaat dari pohon yang saya tanam ini saat pohon ini berbuah belum tentu saya masih hidup saya menanam pohon pohon ini karena buah zaitun yang selama ini saya nikmati juga berasal dari pohon yang ditanam oleh orang sebelum saya saya ingin membalas kebaikan mereka dengan menanam kebaikan yang sama membayangkan buah zaitun yang berlimpah yang bisa dinikmati banyak keluarga pohon yang hijau amp rindang yang memberikan naungan dari terik dan hujan minyak zaitun yang memberi manfaat semua itu membuat saya bersemangat untuk menanam pohon sebanyak yang saya bisa

3613150 it would be folly not to undertake a proper and thorough review of the states energy policy
3613151 weve been concerned for some time about a lack of diversity in supply and a need for a proper energy security policy in this state
3613152 the gas crisis has been one of the most significant challenges to face the wa business community and general community in many years
3613153 we estimate it will cost business at least 2 4 billion already but the final cost will be higher and is hard to estimate accurately
3613154 we believe though that the terms of reference for this review need to be broadened to include consideration that the contribution that all commercially viable energy sources can make in the future
3613155 were not just talking gas and coal but also renewables and the energy option that dares not speak its name nuclear
3613156 were not saying we should build a nuclear power station in wa
3613157 were saying we should have a rational and sensible debate
3613158 it might be a little much to ask from politicians who cant even deregulate shopping hours but we remain hopeful
3613159 it is a somewhat perverse position that penalties will in affect apply to the lng liquefied natural gas industry which right now is arguable making australias single most important contribution to limiting greenhouse emissions globally
3613160 exports to asia are actually replacing less greenhouse friendly fuels
3613161 any move in an ets that doesnt recognise the importance and enormous potential investment in that industry is a scheme which is flawed
3613162 if hansen is out then weve got as in tall forwards to replace him probably only tony notte available
3613163 hes like all teenagers over the next two or three years hell physically develop to get closer to achieving his full potential but hes probably good enough now
3613164 hes quick and hes got clean hands they are two good strengths to have
3613165 thommo dropped his form for a couple of weeks about a month ago but hes really fought back well and ive been pleased with the way hes done that
3613166 and in a struggling team claremont the last couple of weeks hes played very well so we certainly take that into account and believe he can come in now
3613167 excuse me if i had only had a bar of soap
3613168 have a good day mam im so sorry i offended you
3613169 look hes still working through getting his quad strength back from a knee operation thats what can happen you lose a bit of power so well weigh that up
3613170 des is a guy thats got the magic that you look for sometimes and hes got the ability even at 90 per cent to hold his own in the team
3613171 hes trained his backside off to get back and play because he loves playing so you dont deny a guy that he wants to play as many games as he can
3613172 im just going to think like im playing with my local club really once youre on the field and youve had a look thats about it
3613173 it was a bit of a shock hopefully i can back it up
3613174 its amazing im shocked about that to be honest even though he has been there for me for everything taken me overseas thats just awesome
3613175 theres some nerves in there but im excited i cant wait for it

3613179 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a seven per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3613180 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3613181 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
3613182 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation

3613184 you declare the way you are voting when you walk into a voting booth
3613185 it would be very hard to prove that there was concerted effort to get democrats to vote in a republican primary or vice versa even if you could prove that i dont see its illegal
3613186 im going to protect the voting rights of republican primary voters this is about protecting the integrity of the ballot
3613187 whos to say who you voted for in the gop primary
3613188 you could have voted for david davis or third place gop primary finisher michael sabri whos to say you actually voted for roe people dont vote straight party lines anymore
3613189 we are working very hard in the 1st congressional district to elect democrats thats where our focus has been we did nothing to organize any democrats to vote in the 1st congressional district for either davis or roe
3613190 we have some debt that will be paid out of that
3613191 roe ran a grass roots campaign that challenged the status quo and put people before politics there is no doubt that he will be the next representative for tennessees 1st district
3613192 i predict it will be certified by the state republican party and that will be the end of it i trust the system

3613242 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3613243 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth
3613244 finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3613245 our striking result is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust
3613246 patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3613247 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
3613248 i fast during ramadan myself and know that special measures need to be taken for the spectators for matches played during that month
3613249 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3613250 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3613251 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3613252 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3613253 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3613254 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3613255 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3613256 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3613257 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3613258 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3613259 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3613260 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3613261 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3613262 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3613263 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3613264 the body was exhumed and a post mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death
3613265 look in the boot look in the boot my husband is there look in the bushes
3613266 maybe i should play a bit more against them but our overall play was good we kept the ball speed up and had a good balance with our forwards
3613267 if we maintain what we did it will work for us
3613268 we did not give away too many penalty corners and now have two days to recover and see what we can work on
3613269 i did not feel good that day because of the bruised hip but physical therapy has done a lot of good i am ready for more action
3613270 when you concede 15 goals in two matches its a tough battle to keep your morale up
3613271 we have to take in the good and work out the bad we have played the two strongest teams in our pool so hopefully it should get easier now

3613286 the walls looked like they were moving sometimes there were so many bugs and roaches on the wall
3613287 when the door first opened roaches fell from the ceiling down to the floor so i knew then we were in for something
3613288 there was garbage packed up to the ceiling the smell was so overwhelming the investigator had to where a gas mask
3613289 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside
3613290 chicken and chips was pretty much their diet there was evidence of some other things in there like old pizza boxes but from what i understand those were his and the kids and her were not allowed to partake
3613291 from what i understand he just left and didnt come back and she got word somehow i dont know what happened but she got word somehow that he got involved with another lady
3613292 nobody in this community knew that he had children or a wife thats whats so strange about this this family was so afraid of this man that he said they are not to leave and they did not leave
3613293 he was always talking to my son and to my boyfriend just being normal like normal people do

3613316 hay que felicitar a china por el partido que ha hecho no nos dej hacer nuestro juego pero cuando empezamos a presionar no nos supo atacar y nosotros supimos correr que es el tipo de juego en el que menos nos desenvolvemos
3613317 fue muy dif cil sobre todo en la primera parte porque no sali el juego habitual del equipo y china estuvo muy acertada al final en el tercer y en el ltimo cuartos empez la presi n que abri la remontada
3613318 una mala mentalidad por pensar que el partido estaba ganado antes de jugarlo
3613319 empezamos con muy mala mentalidad porque nos dejamos envolver por el ambiente de que ganamos a grecia en el primer partido que china hab a perdido con los estados unidos y ya pens bamos que hab amos ganado a china salimos sin intensidad y eso nos dur todo el primer tiempo
3613320 en el descanso reflexionamos sobre eso se habl de que china pod a ganar y la actitud del equipo cambi china jug un partido extraordinario

3613354 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3613411 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3613412 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3613413 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3613414 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3613415 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3613416 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3613417 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3613418 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3613419 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3613420 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3613421 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3613422 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3613423 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3613424 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3613430 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3613431 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers

3613442 it is wrong to compare the success of the two films the hindi film industry is one big market whatever money earned from the movies made goes into one kitty the film industry every one benefits out of successful films actors fees also goes up
3613443 in an area like juhu in suburban mumbai there are 28 shows of the film in one multiplex alone due to this 80 to 90 per cent money is recovered by the producer
3613444 it is quite natural that the collections slump at the start of the second week everything depends on how steep is the decline in box office collections if the steep is less the film is sure to bounce back during the weekend
3613445 they are adults and since they are said to have fought they would patch up eventually who am i to interfere the film industry is undergoing a change in the last five years bigger films with huge budgets are made profits made by any film helps the industry to grow dividing the industry into camps is not fair

3613509 that is why i submit the moors in spain achieved such a high culture their fathers were born into a polygamous tradition but their mothers were the daughters of christians and jews and had spent their early years in an absolutely monogamous environment the sons of these women laid the foundations of rationalistic culture but soon the supply of christian and jewish women was insufficient so the incipient rationalism failed to mature greatly
3613510 a female emancipating movement is a cultural phenomenon of unfailing regularity it appears to be the necessary outcome of absolute monogamy the subsequent loss of social energy after the emancipation of women which is sometimes emphasized has been due not to the emancipation but to the extension of sexual opportunity which has always accompanied it in human records there is no instance of female emancipation which has not been accompanied by an extension of sexual opportunity

3613530 oh its okay but you saw that episode of seinfeld right
3613531 remember when he was worked by a fake tammy sytch ahd a fake trish what an idiot
3613532 aww shapiro you are the new king of the ding dong innernets hyuck
3613533 why do they call it national geographic when they show pictures of other nations they ought to call it international geographic
3613534 chris hyatte used racial and lowbrow humor to recap the monday night wrestling shows then got scammed by guys who acted like fake divas then outlasted his welcome by about 4 years
3613535 thereve been a lot of positive signs for the game of rugby the game has become more of a spectacle and i know the guys enjoy the challenge under the new laws
3613536 the ball was in play for 39 minutes in the sydney test against the all blacks last year the average was 25 or 26 minutes so it requires a different kind of athlete it also requires some astute substituting its something we needed to learn
3613537 we were simply out thought by robbie deans in the sydney test he had something like 20 games experience whereas we had just two under the elvs we have since been trying to get it right
3613538 we learned a lot from the sydney situation we had to put our heads together to come up wit a different strategy but we cant play against south africa the same way we played against australia
3613539 it doesnt matter how much possession you have its how you use it
3613540 with the new sanctions at the breakdown you also dont want to be caught in possession too often and then the free kick can often give the momentum to the opposing team
3613541 thats why we see a lot more kicking under the new laws it gives the attacking team the opportunity to put more pressure on the other team
3613542 the all blacks beat the springboks in that series 3 1 after losing a series in 1949 everybody felt proud again after beating the boks
3613543 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3613544 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3613545 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3613546 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3613547 this creates questions about where we are heading i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3613548 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
3613549 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3613550 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3613551 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate
3613552 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3613553 as huge as madibas 90th birthday on 10 years more
3613554 yeah at this stage we south africa dont have that kind of player yet on saturday well definitely have one
3613555 i dont think it could happen to a greater rugby player in our history ive known percy since 1979 i mean 1997 laughing
3613556 this 100th test cap on saturday its as huge as madibas 90 only its 10 years more
3613557 im blessed to work with people like him i will try to keep him calm because i know there is a whirlwind inside him im looking forward to sharing that milestone with him over the weekend
3613558 he is the professional player now and he brings experience to the team his extraordinary experience even when hes not playing hes the same player the same character and you can see it on his face
3613559 what makes him so great is that he is prepared to share his knowledge with everybody in the side he is not keeping anything for himself well this week is going to be huge for him but percy knows that the job is more important than the milestone
3613560 the 100th is going to be special especially at newlands and playing against new zealand makes it even more special
3613561 i try not to talk about it but i get a few of the guys his teammates chirping me at training sessions
3613562 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3613563 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3613564 if you look at the number of matches ricky played in the super 14 competition youll appreciate that his legs may start tiring
3613565 from my perspective i think it is meant to be protective to safeguard security and safety and all the athletes and everybody
3613566 with regards to the stabbing incident i think relevant authorities may have increased the security level
3613567 i do not think there is a real threat you are safe
3613568 dont bring flowers every time either if in doubt roll a dieevery date whenits a six she gets flowers simple enough
3613569 we cant go on living here its literally killing us
3613570 there used to be eighteen retired living workers here seven moved away and are all still alive but eight of the eleven who stayed have died living here is a death sentence
3613571 the residents were told they would have to pay 750 yuan per square meter to buy new homes a price far beyond their means
3613572 the factories have installed first class environment protection facilities there is no pollution problem and therefore no need for people to be relocated
3613573 if there is no pollution where is the foul smell coming from
3613574 but when he phoned back two days later he was told the person he had spoken to no longer worked there
3613575 to make sure his letters of complaint would be safely delivered zhu traveled 15km to post them in an area not controlled by the local leadership
3613576 our interests have been seriously harmed but nobody is listening the peoples congress deputy is supposed to represent us and should be doing something about the pollution problems he their local peoples congress deputy has been neglecting his duty
3613577 a few days later they received a reply from the standing committee saying their attempt to recall chen jun had failed
3613578 stop looking for trouble you are not the only one suffering from pollution you cant right all the worlds wrongs
3613579 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports he said
3613580 there were reports about presence of arab turkmen and local militants in the two hideouts run by a local commander zanjir wazir he added
3613581 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports amp squo amp squo he said
3613582 after years of efforts the city has formed the golden belt for developing modern service industry which gathers more than 70 percent of the citys headquarters economy
3613583 currently shanghai is researching new policies to lure talented people
3613584 there will be also remarkable breakthrough on the household policies
3613585 but if he is taking something written by somebody else and putting it together as some sort of compilation to create the book then some different inferences might flow
3613586 i dont even know why my client is wearing the thing on his head
3613587 to me its odd to him it is perfectly normal
3613588 the combo color is so beautiful and ive used some new overlays by danielle coming soon at catscrap im such a teaser hahaha
3613589 ah eva youre so good with technology and electronic things
3613590 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
3613591 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3613592 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3613593 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3613594 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3613595 as we have said many times there is an important debate to be had on the potential role of gm crops in the future and we welcome all voices in that debate
3613596 safety will always be our top priority on this issue
3613597 coming home to roost and settle heavily in the genetically modified trees
3613598 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3613599 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress
3613600 it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3613601 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3613602 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3613603 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3613604 i was sweating and shaking i couldnt catch my breath and i thought i was going to die
3613605 when i got home i forced myself to drive again but in less than a mile i felt uneasy here i go again the next day i was at the library looking up phobia i read about panic attacks then searched the internet for a psychotherapist
3613606 then one day i arrived for my appointment and my therapist was wearing her winter coat
3613607 she told me we were going for a ride and i was the driver she wasnt afraid to drive with me
3613608 one in 50 people arriving in the emergency room has chest pains due to a panic attack
3613609 when i see a young adult with chest discomfort complaining of tingling in the fingertips an episode of hyperventilation and stating he had an upsetting event such as a heated conversation with a girlfriend
3613610 but they can be managed people have panic attacks all the time theyll feel an uncomfortable level of anxiety and not pay any attention to it
3613611 when that happens if the person starts avoiding places and situations that may trigger another attack agoraphobia
3613612 if you shy away from a situation every time you feel anxious or panicky your brain learns to avoid rather than confront
3613613 you have uncomfortable symptoms but youre not scared its annoying but you know its not dangerous or life threatening the goal is to understand and accept that a panic attack is not dangerous or life threatening
3613614 the treatment of choice is cognitive behavioral therapy with or without medication
3613615 expose yourself to anxiety producing situations and learn that while panic attacks can be alarming theyre typically short lived and harmless
3613616 i was wrong to think i was supposed to live without fear
3613617 learning to do things even with the fear was an epiphany
3613618 almost everyone in this age of anxiety suffers from elevated levels of the stress hormones adrenalin and cortisol and theyre fight or flight hormones that repress the immune system
3613619 its improved my ability to process stress sleep better have calmness and lower blood pressure your health is going to be really good when youre not freaking out all the time
3613620 i used to get pneumonia all the time but no more
3613621 carbon dioxide contributes to aging cell deterioration and stress while oxygen fills the body with energy vitality and prana sanskrit word meaning life force
3613622 i rarely get sick and the bad habits fall away i have no interest in alcohol anymore and dont smoke anymore
3613623 i was in a coma for six days when i woke up i couldnt speak english i had to become a human being again i started meditating to find out who i am and what i have
3613624 its total awareness of sound feeling breath i become a much more conscious human being health has a lot to do with the mind if youre stressed out all the time the mind is not going to be clear stress is such a destructive thing worry tightens the muscles and being in the present releases stress
3613625 with meditation im much more balanced and dont feel like a runaway horse i want my life balanced calm and loving
3613626 theres nothing you cant do if you put your mind to it
3613627 in our society happiness is outward so youre never satisfied and always looking for the next thing
3613628 were making progress but we still have much to do
3613629 with todays high energy prices it is as important as ever for us to try to control our fuel costs and reduce risks associated with fuel price volatility
3613630 we adjust our fuel hedges on an ongoing basis depending on market conditions and the forward looking analytics for jet fuel
3613631 some airlines particularly southwest airlines reduced the impact of rising fuel prices on their costs through fuel hedges
3613632 however most of those airlines hedges are limited or in the case of southwest will expire within the next few years and may be replaced with new but more expensive hedges
3613633 the costs are so low that youre not going to prosecute
3613634 we dont look at products for their efficacy or if theyre making false claims
3613635 we only look at products if they are harming the environment
3613636 right now theres so much junk out there that it hurts a good product
3613637 continuing violations of federal law are critical to plant safety
3613638 oshas current view that bp products is in compliance with the osha agreement is in essence a decision not to take any further enforcement for a breach of the agreement
3613639 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3613640 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3613641 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3613642 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3613643 it is encouraging to know that parents are sitting down to discuss the basics of money management with their children financial education must begin at home
3613644 we hope that parents will use opportunities like back to school shopping time as a way to begin or continue the money conversation because learning about how to budget save and spend responsibly is critical for young people

3613648 lufthansa is increasing its services to and from brazil in cooperation with tam
3613649 the codeshare agreement with our partner tam will provide our passengers with seamless connections to further domestic destinations via frankfurt and s o paulo our passengers will be able to reach these airports conveniently with only one check in at the start of their journey
3613650 linking lufthansa and tams schedules will increase the benefits for our customers moreover we are stimulating growth in air traffic between germany and brazil
3613651 delaying medical treatment and regular physicals puts consumers at risk for potential health issues and increases overall health insurance costs
3613652 its critical that consumers continue to take responsibility for their health so that we can all benefit from healthier lives and more affordable healthcare
3613653 insurance is an important and oftentimes mandated purchase for most americans
3613654 that is why the naic and state insurance regulators are committed to helping every american be a smarter insurance consumer
3613655 insurance is one of the easiest ways that consumers can protect themselves against significant financial loss especially during difficult economic times
3613656 its also important that consumers understand their insurance needs and options we urge them to visit insure u to learn more
3613657 the world can be divided in many ways rich and poor democratic and authoritarian but one of the most striking is the divide between the societies with an individualist mentality and the ones with a collectivist mentality
3613658 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment
3613659 a little confessed evil saves one from acknowledging a lot of hidden evil
3613660 i am well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps than those i have described for example some commentators have suggested that we should criminally prosecute the people found in the reports to have committed misconduct where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws that does not mean as some people have suggested that those officials who were found by the joint reports to have committed misconduct have suffered no consequences far from it the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3613661 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3613662 we have successfully turned increased prices into higher gross margins this is the basis of our satisfying earnings growth
3613663 the record result expected for the entire year of 2008 and the high inflow of funds create an excellent platform for the group s strategic growth

3613668 my neighbour is only going to get two hours of light a day there are only a small number of us but we are very irate
3613669 we believe that incorporating facilities such as student accommodation that benefit the whole community as well as the clubs is the right way forward
3613670 the central goal of this strategy is to ensure there are no surprises for anyone at any stage of the process

3613674 i had told myself long ago that three books in a series are enough for my attention span and so after i devoted myself to the trio of books in the tales of london series then wrote a table by the window my contemporary novel
3613675 prayerfully i decided to return to gresham setting the story fifteen years after julia hollis and her children first left london for abandoned coaching inn which became larkspur inn i believe readers would like to see how the children philip aleda and grace elizabeth and laurel turn out as adults but i like to inject fresh faces into every book hence jewel libby and her daughter becky find gresham a haven from a bad man writing the book was like coming home visiting old friends

3613732 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a seven per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3613733 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3613734 thanks to the olympic games the proportion of dmb phones is likely to rise further this month
3613735 im just going to think like im playing with my local club really once youre on the field and youve had a look thats about it
3613736 it was a bit of a shock hopefully i can back it up
3613737 its amazing im shocked about that to be honest even though he has been there for me for everything taken me overseas thats just awesome
3613738 theres some nerves in there but im excited i cant wait for it
3613739 ive learned so much already in just a short time being here hes kosmina changed my game heaps
3613740 look hes still working through getting his quad strength back from a knee operation thats what can happen you lose a bit of power so well weigh that up
3613741 des is a guy thats got the magic that you look for sometimes and hes got the ability even at 90 per cent to hold his own in the team
3613742 hes trained his backside off to get back and play because he loves playing so you dont deny a guy that he wants to play as many games as he can
3613743 if hansen is out then weve got as in tall forwards to replace him probably only tony notte available
3613744 hes like all teenagers over the next two or three years hell physically develop to get closer to achieving his full potential but hes probably good enough now
3613745 hes quick and hes got clean hands they are two good strengths to have
3613746 thommo dropped his form for a couple of weeks about a month ago but hes really fought back well and ive been pleased with the way hes done that
3613747 and in a struggling team claremont the last couple of weeks hes played very well so we certainly take that into account and believe he can come in now
3613748 but if he is taking something written by somebody else and putting it together as some sort of compilation to create the book then some different inferences might flow
3613749 i dont even know why my client is wearing the thing on his head
3613750 to me its odd to him it is perfectly normal
3613751 it would be folly not to undertake a proper and thorough review of the states energy policy
3613752 weve been concerned for some time about a lack of diversity in supply and a need for a proper energy security policy in this state
3613753 the gas crisis has been one of the most significant challenges to face the wa business community and general community in many years
3613754 we estimate it will cost business at least 2 4 billion already but the final cost will be higher and is hard to estimate accurately
3613755 we believe though that the terms of reference for this review need to be broadened to include consideration that the contribution that all commercially viable energy sources can make in the future
3613756 were not just talking gas and coal but also renewables and the energy option that dares not speak its name nuclear
3613757 were not saying we should build a nuclear power station in wa
3613758 were saying we should have a rational and sensible debate
3613759 it might be a little much to ask from politicians who cant even deregulate shopping hours but we remain hopeful
3613760 it is a somewhat perverse position that penalties will in affect apply to the lng liquefied natural gas industry which right now is arguable making australias single most important contribution to limiting greenhouse emissions globally
3613761 exports to asia are actually replacing less greenhouse friendly fuels
3613762 any move in an ets that doesnt recognise the importance and enormous potential investment in that industry is a scheme which is flawed
3613763 grid thyself with the weapons of knowledge and the armor of wisdom victory is won as much through strength of mind and will as through brawn and steel
3613764 apples and wine women are like apples on trees the best ones are at the top of the tree most men dont want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt instead they sometimes take the apples from the ground that arent as good but easy the apples at the top think something is wrong with them when in reality theyre amazing they just have to wait for the right man to come along the one who is brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree share this with women who are good apples even those who have already been picked
3613765 i dont see any statements made by lim that warrants unnecessary fear of racial tension or negative repercussion hence the need to advise him
3613766 what lim did on the very first day he was sworn in as the cm of penang was visit the penang malay settlement which was neglected without any solutions in sight as to the status of their land that they have settled in for decades
3613767 but lim had pledged that he will seriously consider alleviating their plight by giving them rights to be permanently settled on the land
3613768 i believe if there are leaders that deserve to be advised and cautioned on making statements these people are none other than umno bn leaders
3613769 we have seen during the pre election period how datuk seri najib tun razak spoke in tv and other media telling the chinese in kelantan that they have been deprived of their rights under the pas led government
3613770 and that umno is coming to play the role of saviour to free them from continued discrimination and deprivation under pas rule isnt this kind of statement tantamount to incitement
3613771 and i can still recall how datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi cautioned the indians and the chinese against experimenting in choosing a new government that they will surely be left out with less representatives in the bn government should they go ahead with their experiment
3613772 was more keen to deny the barisan nasional a two third majority
3613773 whereas for keadilan our objective is to offer the people the choice to form an alternative government
3613774 we are happy with the choice of candidates because it is based on general consensus
3613775 in fact she even got a better deal she is now in a better school and one that is nearer to her house
3613776 this should not be the case does it mean that students should keep quiet no matter what a teacher does
3613777 we want people to change their behavior and use more water efficient products for landscaping
3613778 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3613779 i am angry with you but wont tell you why so instead ill just use my most irritated tone with you so that by the time we hang up youll be pulling your hair out and then not able to focus on anything that needs to be done because youll be wondering what you did to make me so irritated
3613780 make that police department wish they never heard of your name when the lawyers get fineshed
3613781 we are aware of the situation and are in the process of gathering information regarding this incident
3613782 we will refrain from further comment at this time until we have all the details and have had time to brief our personnel who are traveling due to the olympics
3613783 i couldnt see anything for the last 100 phelps said
3613784 my goggles pretty much filled up with water it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest but its fine i wanted to break the record i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3613785 if this game we should lose from the beginning by 10 points then ok
3613786 but now we can win this game and we did not
3613787 we had every chance to win and in the last two or three minutes of regulation time i thought we were winning
3613788 but we were too nervous by the end of the game to harvest victory
3613789 we feel fortunate to have this many guys that are that good at that position
3613790 were going to go with the guy that gives us the best opportunity to win
3613791 hes the one that makes the decisions im just happy to be part of the foundation for what hes trying to do for this program
3613792 it really worked well because he came in with a new system so everybody had to learn it so these guys didnt have an upper hand on me at all
3613793 a lot of schools would have redshirt me or switched my position
3613794 by them letting me compete for the spot its not only showing everybody what ive got but its showing the team what i have and it builds a lot of confidence in the team
3613795 a lot of people were angry or upset that i left houston but it really wasnt a commitment to the people in the community
3613796 it was more of a commitment to the coach and the program when he came over to baylor i just decided to follow him
3613797 a lot of people dont want to be a part of the building process
3613798 they want to go somewhere where its already built up and they just have to be a role player i just wanted to come here and be a part of something new something special
3613799 ive been around the block and seen some things that robert probably hasnt seen
3613800 im here for him to lean on and ask questions whether its this year or next year he is the future of baylor football
3613801 wit is not in a position to organize a safe and secure venue in georgia nor to play at an alternative venue
3613802 that is definitely in the back of our minds its the ultimate goal getting softball put back into the lineup for 2016
3613803 i feel and we all feel that softball should be an olympic sport i dont know how much these games are going to matter in helping to make that determination but hopefully we can play the game at the highest level make an impression and spread the word about the high level that we play and also spread the knowledge around the world that we need to continue to grow fast pitch softball
3613804 any olympics in general we are going to try to come out and put down our best performance
3613805 but there probably is a desire to really put a stamp on this one we know that its the last olympics for softball at least for now
3613806 this is definitely my last olympics and wed like to give everyone something to really remember
3613807 ive said all along that our job as players and coaches right now is to prepare ourselves and do as well as we can as a team
3613808 were not trying to put on a show were playing the game the way we know how to play the game usa softball is playing the game hard playing aggressively playing with heart if it was a great show i hope we have eight more great shows
3613809 we knew that we were going to face the best players in the world
3613810 it was a lot of fun even though it was very hard because they pressed us a lot you just have to take a lot of good things from this game because they are the best
3613811 what i will remember is the play in the second quarter the usa was on a fast break and somebody passed the ball to lebron and he dunked it with his left hand i think it was amazing
3613812 hopefully i can help more in the red zone receiving and blocking
3613813 we need to run the ball better in the red zone if we can itll open up the passing game more and hopefully open things for me working the middle of the field
3613814 obviously protecting the ball is a big issue with me as it is with the whole team
3613815 when you practice protecting the ball its not the same you expect it because you know whats going on
3613816 last year i was trying to do some extra stuff after the catch and i lost focus on protecting the ball a little i never had a problem with it in college at wisconsin after i focused on it last year it wasnt a problem because i made sure i was protecting that thing
3613817 he takes a lot of hits we need to get his pads down i think thats the biggest fault of the fumbles
3613818 the thing ive been impressed with is that hes better along the line of scrimmage than he has been
3613819 thats probably the thing thats kept him from getting some of the respect some of these other tight ends get if he continues to develop in that area he can be even better than he already is
3613820 as our team improves i might be recognized a little more
3613821 but its tough because there are so many good tight ends especially in our conference it says a lot if you play well enough to be recognized with guys who have been doing it for a while
3613822 im not a big vocal guy but i hope i can be looked on as a leader on this team
3613823 i try to do it by being solid on the field and doing my job from week to week
3613824 i improved last season but i want to be more consistent i feel pretty comfortable with what were doing how many catches i have isnt important whats important is for me to do whatever it takes to help us get where we want to go
3613825 if jeffrey dahmer could play wed say he had an eating disorder
3613826 dont worry about looking cool youre young thats cool enough
3613827 i try to eat every three to four holes to keep my metabolism steady
3613828 bring snacks that you will actually eat but stay away from candy bars
3613829 but if you are prepared before you step on the practice tee you will be able to tolerate it and build the endurance to stick it out a bit longer than you think
3613830 when i am giving golf lessons outside the biggest things that help me get through the hot humid days are a good breakfast even when i am not hungry two applications of 50 plus sunscreen and a water bottle that never leaves my side
3613831 if you can find shade when you practice that is best
3613832 if you become dizzy and or pale quickly go for the shade and water place a cool cloth on your head and around your neck after you recover go home you dont want to push it once you become overheated you are more susceptible to becoming overheated in the future
3613833 guys have to be ready to go because it gets very competitive i think the fact they are an excellent team and the way people are talking about them this season its a great judge for us to go up there for three or four days and see where were at
3613834 he did what he thought was best hopefully we can get going this week and hopefully have no setbacks and keep going
3613835 the thing im encouraged of is how positive he is with me
3613836 last year when we went through this he was very apprehensive he knew he was going to have a hard time
3613837 he tells me hes going to be fine he feels good i dont want to put a timetable on it right now i think we go day to day but his strength is there so thats good
3613838 were just going to run our base stuff and im sure they are going to do the same
3613839 he made two plays that were the difference in winning or losing just hustling chasing the ball down whenever they broke big plays
3613840 its not too big for him he knows what hes doing hes very capable and he has shown he can help on special teams so his reps will go up this week
3613841 my goggles pretty much filled with water and it kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
3613842 but i wanted to break the record i wanted to 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3613843 i have been expecting to win for the last four years
3613844 when you get criticism as long as its fair and honest players will always accept it and kevin can do that they would take it on the chin and respond to it
3613845 there will be a case to be supportive but also there will be times when he will have words with players because that will be the right thing to do at the time what they will know with kevin is that hell be in there scrapping with them he will put his own neck on the line and hell get stuck in and go with it and i think theyll respect him for that
3613846 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3613847 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3613848 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3613849 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law

3613860 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3613861 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3613862 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3613867 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before
3613868 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
3613869 ba and aa will argue that their alliance is now acceptable because the competitive environment has changed with the open skies accord on uk us routes this is a complete red herring open skies which is only a temporary accord as it may be unwound in 2010 has not significantly increased competition on uk london us routes
3613870 neither is the current economic slowdown a justification for waiving through any application the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal with
3613871 ba aa would have a combination of high frequencies and a transatlantic network that could not be replicated by any other airline alliance and which would make it impossible for other carriers to compete for time sensitive corporate or business travelers
3613872 we now have a similar situation at new york airports with government imposed restrictions the heathrow new york jfk route is by far the most important transatlantic market accounting for over 25 of the total heathrow us market
3613873 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late

3613878 about 11am aest one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land he said
3613879 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle
3613880 the aircraft was circling over the ocean to receive a standard damage check from the other hawk pilot the spokesman said
3613881 while circulating the aircraft was also burning off fuel to reduce its landing weight
3613882 about 11am aest one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land he said
3613883 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle

3613886 i consider it a victory because it does show that the process works
3613887 i hope it does not take a concession of error every time for a writ to be successful
3613888 he would not have sexual contact with her if she returned to the soccer camp

3613890 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
3613891 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
3613892 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
3613893 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3613894 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
3613895 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3613896 we handled it as well as we could under the circumstances
3613897 we took precautions to make sure the temporary fix is safe

3613903 in tskhinvali the south ossetian provincial capital now under russian control the body of a georgian soldier lay in the street along with debris
3613904 im trying not to be a cynic but i feel all sides are trying to get their propaganda in
3613905 were delighted that we have over 25 000 names now of people who have said theyre supportive of the new team and that were told should convert to something like 15 000 new members which we find fantastic
3613906 i know at brisbane they wouldnt have 20 000 queensland members because their membership is made up of some ex fitzroy people as well so thats an amazing start really
3613907 if you cant land one then youve got to live without it but ideally youd love to be able to announce in 2010 you couldnt do it before then a player of someone like nick riewoldt would be fantastic but who knows whats going to happen in the next two years

3613927 t raditionally distance running performance was thought to be determined by several characteristics including maximum oxygen consumption vo2max lactate threshold and running economy that could be improved through endurance training

3613971 by paul della marta dean collins and karl braganza recd june 2003 published
3613972 ultimately a subjective decision was made for each station as to whether it was likely to have been influenced by urbanisation
3613973 however at present the information in the database is only reliable since the mid to late 1990s
3613974 some records contain ed many years in which annual mean values were estimated by torok and nicholls 1996 using a reference series based on highly correlated neighbour series
3613975 it was a great 2 years getting to know you and it is also a two years too short
3613976 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3613977 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3613978 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3613979 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3613980 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3613981 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3613982 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3613983 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3613984 you have your naked davids slaying goliaths well women are every bit mans equal in that regard and their nudity may be similarly heroic and meaningful
3613985 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3613986 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3613987 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3613988 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3613989 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3613990 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3613991 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3613992 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3613993 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3613994 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3613995 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3613996 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3613997 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3613998 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3613999 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3614000 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3614001 forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us
3614002 father forgive them for they know not what they do
3614003 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3614004 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3614005 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3614006 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3614007 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3614008 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3614009 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3614010 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3614011 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3614012 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3614013 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3614014 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3614015 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3614016 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3614017 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3614018 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3614019 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3614020 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3614021 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3614022 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3614023 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3614024 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3614025 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3614026 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3614027 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3614028 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3614029 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3614030 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3614031 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3614032 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3614033 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3614034 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3614035 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3614036 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3614037 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3614038 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3614039 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3614040 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3614041 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3614042 is asking vh1 to grant her another season of her hit show
3614043 her relationship with tailor made ended shortly after the reunion show was taped and that she wants another season of i love new york so that she could find the man of her dreams
3614044 tailor made is saying that the overbearing differences between them have become too much
3614045 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3614046 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3614047 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3614048 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3614049 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3614050 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3614051 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3614052 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3614053 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3614054 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3614055 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3614056 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3614057 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3614058 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3614059 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3614060 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3614061 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3614062 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3614063 who are open to doing something on the production side
3614064 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3614065 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3614066 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3614067 there are no obvious reasons why the banks wouldnt pass through any change in the cash rate
3614068 funding environment is quite different even in the past few weeks
3614069 the reason this is so significant at present is that customer deposits only account for around 50 per cent of bank funding
3614070 the gap between the cash rate and money market rates is much wider than the historical average and is not showing any sign of easing the new reality is that movements in cash rates set by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding
3614071 the average cost of funds the money that banks have borrowed on domestic and international markets to lend their customers is increasing
3614072 the situation changed over the last couple of weeks with the impact of statements that came out of melbourne with regard to a couple of banks nab anz and their respective positions which has had some impact internationally on the reputation of australian banks and the ability to access international funding markets
3614073 the rba talks to the banks via hotline no doubt and they probably have a good feel as to how the banks will respond given the 50 basis points cut call was largely predicated on the commercial banks not passing anything on the rba can probably stick to 25 basis points in september
3614074 obviously they the rba would like to see the banks fully pass it on whether they do or not is completely up to the banks

3614098 we waited for this for so long and hes there and i cant wait for this to end
3614099 its like a whole year preparing for all this and now its here and its crazy
3614100 le mono d isme reste marqu par la libert sp culative de nietzsche
3614101 mejor yo no me meto en eso porque puedo equivocarme porque no tengo conocimiento exacto de c mo se ha manejado eso dej moslo as
3614102 en este momento no me siento capaz de tener la visi n clara de todo eso
3614103 un pa s subdesarrollado necesita m s bien que lleguen capitales en vez de exportarlos por qu no se lo entregaron a un fideicomiso del banco nacional y otro al de costa rica
3614104 entiendo el sentido de los obispos cuando vieron que econ micamente lo mejor era invertir con este grupo pero creo que ticamente ha sido el error m s grande que ha cometido la jerarqu a de la iglesia en los ltimos a os porque se han aliado con un grupo y unas personas que desde cualquier punto de vista social que se le juzgue han resultado nefastas para este pa s
3614105 es inconcebible que manejando millones en la conferencia episcopal puedan alegar desconocimiento que otras personas hicieron negocios y ellos no se hab an dado cuenta es una mentira que pocos se pueden tragar
3614106 los bienes de los cristianos seg n el evangelio son un instrumento para hacer caridad dios no quiere templos ni grandes edificios ni grandes fondos de inversi n solo quiere que las personas se quieran entre s y se traten como iguales
3614107 los fondos que recibe la comunidad cristiana para el uso comunitario deben de provenir nicamente de las limosnas de las contribuciones de sus fieles poner dinero a rentar para financiar sus actividades eclesi sticas es un pecado
3614108 porque actualmente se est n dedicando a financiar actividades con las que antes manten an cierta distancia como el foro agrario que se realiz el 28 y 29 de julio esto es una vuelta de la iglesia a la recuperaci n del campesinado es una inversi n grande para este encuentro
3614109 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3614110 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures
3614111 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
3614112 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
3614113 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
3614114 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
3614115 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
3614116 how can we get talks back on track if the prime minister the other people we meet with cant control the military the intelligence services
3614117 india did not try to draw mileage on that and get an outline for a real agreement
3614118 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3614119 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3614120 were really looking deeply at qantas safety systems across the board
3614121 we are now trying to rectify the situation and investigating what caused them to miss that step
3614122 certainly were taking it very seriously but people shouldnt jump from that to being alarmed
3614123 its not as if they were trying to hide anything it looks like this is just a genuine mistake

3614127 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3614128 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3614129 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3614130 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3614131 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3614132 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3614133 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3614134 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3614135 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3614136 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3614137 sorry for all the mondays and to those who cant sing
3614138 if this actually works it will make everyone feel good but well have to give it back

3614171 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3614172 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3614173 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3614174 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3614175 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around

3614196 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato

3614200 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light

3614205 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3614206 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3614207 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3614208 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3614209 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3614210 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3614211 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3614212 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her

3614218 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3614219 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3614220 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3614221 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3614222 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3614223 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3614224 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them

3614228 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3614229 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3614230 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3614231 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3614232 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3614233 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3614234 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3614235 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3614236 mijn bril zat vol water de laatste honderd meter zag ik niks meer
3614237 het werd erger en erger op een gegeven moment zag ik de wand niet meer

3614242 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3614243 i can only express my thanks for the people who have expressed confidence in me
3614244 people dont realize how dramatic the school boards impact could be with a few changes
3614245 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3614246 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3614247 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3614248 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3614249 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3614250 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3614251 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3614252 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3614253 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3614254 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3614255 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3614256 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
3614257 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads
3614258 and some of the pizzas we made popular at corleones flatbread pizzas are a big seller for us and some nice corned beef and french dip sandwiches

3614261 bring top minor league professional mens basketball back to cleveland
3614262 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
3614263 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
3614264 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3614265 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3614266 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3614267 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3614268 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3614269 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3614270 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3614271 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3614272 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3614273 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3614274 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3614275 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda
3614276 you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you can not fool all of the people all of the time

3614279 we live in a dirty and dangerous world there are some things the general public does not need to know and shouldnt i believe democracy flourishes when the government can take legitimate steps to keep its secrets and when the press can decide whether to print what it knows

3614283 the beings whether great or small are connected with one another by the perfect wisdom of god and affect and influence one another if it were not so in the universal system and the general arrangement of existence there would be disorder and imperfection but as beings are connected one with another with the greatest strength they are in order in their places and perfect this subject is worthy of examination
3614284 the world of creation has had no beginning and will have no end because it is the arena upon which the attributes and qualities of the spirit are manifested can we limit god and his power in the same manner we cannot limit his creations and attributes just as the reality of divinity is limitless likewise his grace and bounties are limitless
3614285 a sprinkling from the unfathomed depth of his sovereign and all
3614286 word of god which is the cause of the entire creation while all else besides his word are but the creatures and the effects thereof
3614287 a chain of causation must of necessity lead eventually to him who is the ever living the all powerful who is self dependent and the ultimate cause this universal reality cannot be sensed it cannot be seen it must be so of necessity for it is all embracing not circum scribed and such attributes qualify the effect and not the cause
3614288 mind impelled by brahmans desire to create performs the work of creation by modifying itself thence ether is produced
3614289 the names and attributes of god require the existence of objects or creatures upon which they have been bestowed and in which they become manifest because they convey life they are called life giving because they provide they are called bountiful the provider because they create they are called creator because they educate and govern the name lord god is applied that is to say the divine names emanate from the eternal attributes of divinity
3614290 whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attributes and names of god inasmuch as within every atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the revelation of that most great light
3614291 primary matter continues to receive all things and yet never takes a permanent impress from any of the things that enter it it is a kind of neutral plastic material on which changing impressions are stamped by the things which enter it making it appear different at different times
3614292 are the same yet they are different such as communicate the generating influence the collective attributes of god as the fashioner and such as receive its impact primary matter are indeed created through the irresistible word of god
3614293 the first emanation from god is the bounty of the kingdom which emanates and is reflected in the reality of the creatures like the light which emanates from the sun and is resplendent in creatures and this bounty the word of god which is the light is reflected in infinite forms in the reality of all things and specifies and individualizes itself according to the capacity the worthiness and the intrinsic value of things
3614294 is higher and far superior to that which the senses can perceive for it is sanctified from any property or substance it transcendeth the limitations of known elements and is exalted above all the essential and recognized substances it became manifest without any syllable or sound and is none but the command of god which pervadeth all created things it hath never been withheld from the world of being every thing must needs have an origin and every building a builder verily the word of god is the cause which hath preceded the contingent world a world which is adorned with the splendours of the ancient of days yet is being renewed and regenerated at all times
3614295 all things are subject to transformation and change save only the cause of existence itself
3614296 what is the substance out of which everything in particle physics is made
3614297 the world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient these two are the same yet they are different
3614298 he it is who perceived a unique a tempered and a pervasive nature in things bearing the closest likeness to the human spirit and he discovered this nature to be distinct from the substance of things in their refined form
3614299 that ether is the origin of all things may still sound to us more physical than metaphysical still the description given ether or akasa shows that more is meant by it than a physical ether and that ether is in fact one of the earlier and less perfect names of the infinite of brahman the universal self the brahman is the same as the ether which is around us and the ether which is around us is the same as the ether which is within us he who dwells in the ether akasa and within the ether whom the ether does not know whose body the ether is and who pulls rules the the ether within he is thy self the puller ruler within the immortal
3614300 the clause ether is the evolver of forms and names designates something other than the individual soul the ether which evolves names and forms cannot be the individual soul either in the state of bondage or that of release in the state of bondage the soul is under the influence of karman itself participates in names and form and hence cannot bring about names and forms and in its released state it is expressly said not to take part in the world business and therefore is all the less qualified to evolve names and forms the lord on the other hand who is the ruling principle in the construction of the universe is expressly declared by scripture to be the evolver of names and forms
3614301 as the spirit of man is the cause of the life of the body man is in the condition of the spirit moreover these members these elements this composition which is found in the organism of man are an attraction and a magnet for the spirit it is certain that the spirit will appear in it so a mirror which is clear will certainly attract the rays of the sun it will become luminous and wonderful images will appear in it i e when these existing elements are gathered together in the natural order and with perfect strength they become a magnet for the spirit and the spirit will become manifest in them with all its perfections
3614302 all the wondrous achievements ye now witness are the direct consequences of the revelation of this name in the days to come ye will verily behold things of which ye have never heard before thus hath it been decreed in the tablets of god and none can comprehend it except them whose sight is sharp

3614309 se pretende que la sala constitucional establezca hasta d nde puede llegar esa promoci n del arbitraje y dem s medios alternativos de soluci n de conflictos
3614310 los solicitantes no plantearon ninguna duda interpretativa acerca del contenido de la norma constitucional sino que se pretende que la sala declare la interpretaci n del precepto que los solicitantes asumen a t tulo particular
3614311 no se puede forzar a una parte o a ambas a ir a un arbitraje por presunci n o deducci n de su voluntad y mucho menos cuando se trate de un estado soberano
3614312 el arbitraje es un mecanismo amistoso que requiere del acercamiento de las partes y exige la actuaci n de buena fe en todo momento
3614313 el elemento fundamental del arbitraje es la manifestaci n de voluntad en forma escrita clara expresa indubitable no admiti ndose la voluntad t cita ni la presunta ni la que pueda ser obtenida mediante un proceso deductivo

3614320 then why all the rush to interpolated 120hz 100hz pal for home movie display
3614321 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
3614322 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
3614323 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
3614324 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
3614325 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day

3614332 you got the silver medal because you sucked hows that make you feel
3614333 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3614334 the undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence
3614335 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3614336 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
3614337 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
3614338 if russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community
3614339 first when bush met putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him secondly when condi rice not so long ago said that the american russian relations had never been better than they are today

3614352 when i was younger all i wanted to do was be a singer
3614353 man i wish i had gottne my tias recipie for enchiladas before she went senile they were badass
3614354 that is one of the funniest things you have ever said
3614355 the plot such as it is is compl ete trash and drive l
3614356 thos e kind of think ing shows are borin g
3614357 i dont think you need out to town underwear because nobody would see them
3614358 of course of course we needed a hip hop song about not wanting to wake up in the morning and we always wanted to hear someone rap about the evils of consumerism gone bad we needed a song about escaping from a prison planet run by giant bugs why hasnt anyone else written a short song about not wanting to help your friends move hell theres even one song about a parade not happening on his new album of course
3614359 we had a number of clients who did not like the large minimum requirements on other e mail lists
3614360 my mother says its good now because i get paid for the why
3614361 at bbdo we describe planning as the work behind the work
3614362 the content is based on the strongest foundation were out in the world mining for insights to help consum ers with their lives
3614363 well use any kind of data we can get the clients data segmentation data
3614364 its so important in terms of laying the foundation of how people feel and what they do today
3614365 strategic planning has been at the heart of direct mar keting either as it used to exist as snail mail or if its todays dm one to one contact with consumers
3614366 whats happening now is that dm is no longer siloed and consumer behavior isnt siloed so were using techniques that have not traditionally been used in dm
3614367 we can adapt compelling content much faster to drive behavioral change and we can get feedback much faster
3614368 the real time behavioral data we get from ebay shows what people are buying down to the second that they buy it why certain things are important in the moment
3614369 if we see trends its easier for us to anticipate future behavior and create communications
3614370 if our client wants to increase market share to 12 up from 7 5 by the end of 2009 i know we have to sell x more units
3614371 i can then tell how many people i need to attract
3614372 i always tell people i have the most interesting job in this agency
3614373 i met a guy on the train who was the head of strategy at what was then known as needham harper amp steers he was fascinating one day he said he had a job opening i knew nothing about the agency world but i got the job and ive stayed in the industry ever since
3614374 its like being an fbi profiler were profiling consumers with a great deal of depth about why they do what they do i guess thats why i read a lot of mystery books and love csi because i find it fairly similar to what we do
3614375 strategic planning is not only about looking at consumers in terms of numbers and behaviors but lifestyles and the relationship they have with the brand relationships are also an important part of direct marketing its not just about acquiring customers but keeping them happy and loyal
3614376 in this by invitation only world where the consumer rules the more you do up front to understand the various segments not only of groups of people but of individuals the better your roi will be the more targeted and custom ized the more relevant your message
3614377 in the old days planning was focused on focus groups and writing briefs it was really a passive administrative function we started by saying that we needed to define business challenges much more accurately now we use data analytics to identify targets of high return based on vari ous perspectives on their behavior and are able to hone in on precise groups of people whose behaviors are understood
3614378 with great difficulty anyone who tells you dif ferently is deceiving themselves you try to focus on the essential things such as understanding the conversation going on and the lives of the people even with the best analytics people in the world someone has to think about how to interpret the data to sort wheat from chaff
3614379 i would go so far to say that recent pitches have been won entirely on the ability to do this type of strategic planning work and tie it back to the brand
3614380 everyone involved in the deal saw the growth opportunities in the online commerce space
3614381 folks are continuing to invest in the e commerce channel and as a result it is growing
3614382 a lot of malware attacks like to use news hooks to get people to open the e mails
3614383 weve seen attacks specifically targeted at national sporting organizations that are involved with the olympics in some way
3614384 the pdf opens just like a press release which these organizations are used to getting at this time
3614385 a consumer cant help but become aware of how things are going and how theyre managing their money
3614386 well provide a tool to help them save long term
3614387 a firms goal is to have a one on one conversation
3614388 its a really complex business so companies want to counsel their clients
3614389 one thing all financial institu tions do when theyre trying to drive deposit dollars is come up with a new unique product
3614390 we dont believe in running huge promotions because that just sets in the consumers mind to wait for the next promotion
3614391 we focus on the fact that this isnt about putting 100 in and pulling it out the next week its a long term behavior that you should have
3614392 were trying to create awareness so you want customers to take action to come online come into the banking center or call us its a multichannel approach
3614393 theres an opportunity for institu tions to hop on the bandwagon and say look at us weve been around for years our reserves and our capital are strong were giving strong interest rates
3614394 even if an institution doesnt have the best rate people are concerned with whether their money is going to be there
3614395 were not teaching people to save savings is at the core of what these people do
3614396 the general public often doesnt even know what credit unions are so theres a little bit of an education challenge that they have
3614397 the skeleton crew we have now including myself are just too swamped to respond to even your simple set of questions i apologize
3614398 outdoor industry consolidation and the recent state of the economy
3614399 we have a burgeoning private sector it fills a gap in the post dawkins university system which is a lack of small specialist institutions
3614400 i havent seen studies of the effectiveness of teaching qualifications

3614423 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3614424 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3614425 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3614426 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3614427 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3614428 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3614429 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3614430 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3614431 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3614432 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3614433 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3614434 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3614435 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3614436 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3614437 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3614438 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3614439 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3614440 we took advantage of the brief market rally in april to reduce our equity exposure nonetheless equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline interest income in the banking business rose strongly despite competition for deposits risk costs increased but remained below over the cycle norms costs remained under control in mature markets while we continued to invest to support growth
3614441 all capital and leverage ratios are well within target the group has eur 3 9 billion of spare leverage capacity after the completion of ings eur 5 billion share buyback and the payment of last years final dividend in the second quarter in line with our policy to pay an interim dividend equal to half of the previous years total dividend our interim dividend has been set at eur 0 74 per share to be paid fully in cash
3614442 ing maintained its commercial growth in these challenging market circumstances the net new production of client balances was eur 29 6 billion in the quarter bringing the total to eur 1 482 billion growth was driven by a large increase in lending particularly at the wholesale bank in retail banking and ing direct we continued to grow savings despite strong competition for deposits sales of life insurance were up 8 8 excluding currency impacts as product innovation and expanded distribution helped compensate for lower demand for unit linked products
3614443 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009 we are executing our strategy in the context of this challenging environment by focussing on growing client balances while keeping a close eye on margins and expenses we continue to adapt our product range to meet our customers changing needs while investing to expand our distribution in growth markets in mature markets we are on track with the transformation projects at our retail banking businesses in the benelux and expense reductions at the dutch insurance business are now evident as markets remain volatile we will continue to manage our risk and capital with discipline while financial markets are expected to put pressure on results in the short term we are confident that ing will continue to create profitable growth for our shareholders over the long term through the breadth of our business and the strength of our franchise
3614444 it has come to my attention that there are recent reports circulating regarding my daughter i would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you who are genuinely concerned about reginae and her safety please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that my daughter is alive healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly the rumors are completely false and unfounded neither reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any accident my family and i truly appreciate the concern and support shown to us
3614445 do we really want a free tier if we do how do we structure that were going to start with the model that we know which is transactions and then go from there
3614446 somos novos para o grande p blico mas grande parte da turma j est ralando h algum tempo
3614447 esses meninos tocam na lapa h 10 15 anos quando nem tinha esse p blico todo no meu caso tive sorte de chegar em uma gera o pertinho da nossa e que formou um p blico interessado em m sica popular brasileira
3614448 todo mundo aqui estava trabalhando muito durante a crise quando ela acabou a gente tinha a faca e o queijo na m o
3614449 ficou mais democr tico voc tem a internet para divulgar o seu trabalho houve uma redistribui o de mercado
3614450 quando eu tinha 20 anos n o havia p blico de choro nem se namorava em baile de samba hoje voc tem uma juventude que vai atr s disso do samba do choro e da mpb
3614451 a lapa bomba a vila madalena bomba da a imprensa come a a abrir os olhos e a expans o faz com que o samba seja o centro da cena de novo
3614452 pela primeira vez o artista de s o paulo bem recebido no rio e os cariocas tem boa recep o em s o paulo
3614453 fala se lapa lapa lapa acho que com a quantidade de m sicos novos que surgiram o que temos de novo em termos de repert rio muito fraco muito preso ao passado
3614454 sou a nica pessoa de s o paulo sentada nesta mesa que n o tem nada a ver com o samba e acho que existe um p blico jovem como a gente que foi formado pela internet e tem interesse por artistas dessa gera o independentemente do samba acho cartola pixinguinha todos esses caras muito bons mas eles cantavam o seu tempo e a gente tem de cumprir essa fun o de cantar o nosso tempo tenho um ditado um p no passado outro p no futuro e o saco no presente
3614455 gosto de ligar para o cara ir casa dele tomar cerveja e conhecer suas m sicas mas tenho dificuldade acho que faltam compositores que queiram que a cantora grave
3614456 muitas vezes para voc conhecer um compositor preciso ir na internet para pesquisar n o mais como antigamente que voc podia conhecer atrav s das r dios
3614457 enquanto voc tinha de ir at r dio nacional e esperar o artista aparecer para entregar uma composi o hoje voc acha at o roberto carlos pela internet
3614458 eu esperava que o governo desse dinheiro para quem realmente precisa essa coisa de projeto cultural lei de incentivo tem gente que n o precisa e consegue e quando a gente tenta n o consegue porque a gente perde para os artistas que v o dar muito mais m dia isso um erro da lei
3614459 acho f cil culpar s o gil por isso o que est errado todo o esquema
3614460 a partir do momento que voc entrega para a iniciativa privada o que ela vai fazer com o dinheiro p blico como a lei rouanet voc d a liberdade de a empresa decidir que artista ela vai patrocinar e para ela muito mais interessante dar dinheiro para quem j famoso porque o retorno maior e a voc n o reverte o quadro das injusti as n o d chance para o artista novo
3614461 pensando assim a cultura perde o valor de cidadania de educa o e de arte
3614462 ele entrou dizendo que n o ia ser ministro para cuidar da carreira e do mesmo jeito que entrou ele sai falando que quer voltar a ser m sico
3614463 isso corrobora a tese de que cedo para dizer se a lei pegou ou n o mas com certeza verificar que o n mero de mortes e acidentes pode estar voltando aos patamares de antes da lei uma p ssima not cia
3614464 por isso que uma vez que a lei fica mais dura a fiscaliza o tamb m deve aumentar
3614465 ser o f rum adequado para come armos a discutir se afinal a lei tem chances de pegar ou n o
3614466 a investiga o come ou em janeiro deste ano ap s den ncias da webjet apenas essa empresa teve o preju zo de mais de r 1 milh o no per odo de um ano e meio com as fraudes a quadrilha tamb m aplicou o golpe em outras companhias a reas
3614467 quando a v tima via o extrato cancelava a compra com a operadora do cart o de cr dito que por sua vez suspendia o pagamento companhia a rea no entanto muitas vezes o passageiro j tinha embarcado
3614468 abordamos essas pessoas no aeroporto e trouxemos para a delegacia elas alegaram desconhecer que as passagens eram obtidas de forma il cita e revelaram quem vendia os bilhetes

3614472 queria dizer que da mesma forma que na une surgiu a campanha o petr leo nosso voc s agora est o desafiados a esse outro debate n o menos importante

3614481 os ltimos estudos mostraram que apenas 8 do f sforo presente nas guas vinha dos detergentes a maior parte vem de outras fontes que n o t m sido monitoradas como fertilizantes e esgoto sem tratamento
3614482 os casos podem demorar uns quatro meses para serem julgados no caso de r us presos e uns seis no caso dos r us soltos
3614483 a lei vai fazer deslanchar os casos tecnicamente menos complexos

3614494 conquering the sat how parents can help teens overcome the pressure and succeed
3614495 i would expect that the abandonment of subject tests by the uc would not only cause a snowball effect among other schools but also continue the ascent of the act and the trend toward parity between the act and sat
3614496 the sat reasoning doesnt test more than the ability to be coached in game playing tactics
3614497 id rather have kids learn about u s history physics or english literature instead of spending endless hours studying for the sat reasoning knowledge of a particular subject is something that students can use for the rest of their lives the sat subject tests are not the problem the sat reasoning exam is
3614498 the uc data provide strong evidence that students scores on the sat achievement tests as they were called then are superior predictors of freshman grades than sat scores
3614499 students need information to understand what makes a college special i think the best feature of the site is the unique mix of qualitative and quantitative information each college profile has 25 hyperlinks connecting the student to specific and relevant pages on the college web site
3614500 it was easy to read all the statistics and learn about the demographics of the schools
3614501 i wanted a small college close to a large city in the northeast i was able to look at programs that colleges offered in the arts i liked how the links on each profile were located in the same place and i could easily compare the theater programs
3614502 u s news rankings do not work for me im not sure i understand the relevance of the information they use and it seems like its a gimmick they dont have anything to do with what is important to me and they seem arbitrary or subjective and not related to my quest
3614503 unless there are cases of abandonment or neglect the student is considered as part of that family for federal student aid purposes and institutional aid as well
3614504 we see situations like this often where parents wont pay sometimes parents will pay for the first year and then tell students they are on their own thats difficult too we try to assess the financial strength of the family and determine that the family has the ability to contribute a certain amount of money the students are often caught in the middle
3614505 ive got a little broken bone in there i dont even feel like i should even be out here practicing on it or even going into preseason
3614506 but its something that no one else seems to feel like its affecting everything so im out there practicing and playing the game

3614509 hes a warrior that makes me feel like if i have any knick knack injuries everybody has something bothering them
3614510 if hes pushing through it still catching interceptions with the half hand looking like the penguin then i can play through it
3614511 i wish we had more time the reality is i dont think were very good right now as a team
3614512 if we dont have our stuff right and our guys arent right well get run out of that stadium real quick
3614513 any coach is going to say that but i think were ready
3614514 i dont think a lot of guys are ready to do a lot of things in life but when they get thrown in the fire theyve to man up or b up
3614515 it could be that people are just getting over that issue ok yes i did try before and i didnt get on and now im going to try again
3614516 we would love to see more because theres clearly so many people who could still benefit from it if you look at the total uninsured adults in our state theres like 350 000 that are actually eligible
3614517 for some reason that kind of bad news hangs in the air like bad cigar smoke
3614518 when there is news in the air that there are no longer waiting lists that doesnt get out
3614519 sometimes if we see a change in the premiums they pay at the beginning of the year enrollment will go down christmas time people are trying to find a way to pay for christmas presents and enrollment will go down
3614520 when i was a child i thought as a child but when i became a man
3614521 it would have been financially risky for me to have gone to nyu for music if i had been successful musically i would never have looked back but if the pieces didnt fall into place i would have regretted not going to berkeley cal was the smarter choice for my future the haas school has been great for personal and professional networking and recruiting
3614522 they give you a broad and stereotyped view of what the school is like but they all sound the same
3614523 they seemed tightly knit they hung out together i liked that

3614530 what the council is doing is weve made examining recycling a priority for the fall and to see if there is enough interest
3614531 it takes a lot of time to sort recyclables at the curb
3614532 there could be more customers and i think there will be
3614533 whatever form of recycling we undertake continuing as it is or adding additional opportunities weve got our work cut out for us to notify people

3614536 a habit of basing convictions upon evidence and of giving to them only that degree or certainty which the evidence warrants would if it became general cure most of the ills from which the world suffers
3614537 the great debate will now begin there will be those who will insist that the west did too much and encouraged or even emboldened the georgians and then there will be those who will argue that we did not do enough to prevent this war and to save georgia put me firmly in the latter camp if the west had taken these mounting tensions more seriously this war could have been prevented at the time it looked too hard now there are many who wish they would have acted before it was too late
3614538 now ive got one of each color so im happy
3614539 i feel great its so good i pulled through i felt a little sick last night but i was up for the challenge and tried to get the best out of myself
3614540 it was so great for me to have them pushing me along it got the best out of me

3614548 i think the viewers should be able to understand that in the national interest for the perception of the country this was an extremely important and serious matter
3614549 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3614550 we felt the coupling of a perfect voice with the best appearance produced the most optimal result
3614551 no matter what you say this is a disgraceful decision
3614552 china has always been this way one person does all the work and another person stands in front of them and takes all the credit
3614553 what kind of moral values are these like foreigners are really going to care whether the little girl is pretty or not i say the two girls are both angels both beautiful
3614554 as long as the girl didnt feel humiliated or insulted i dont think its worth criticizing
3614555 every olympic host city will try to show a perfect ceremony wont they
3614556 did anybody demand that there must be real singing in the opening ceremony what the audiences like is a good show with wonderful performances so what if it is false singing
3614557 what separates these folks from the rest i could see it immediately there was an undeniable aliveness when they laughed it was spontaneous loud and decidedly real the conversations were gregarious yet sincere my clients were clearly interested in what each other was saying

3614613 goldie we assume she must call him that its someone from the hall of fame
3614614 the synergy with our existing range is clear we are offering our customers the complete ensemble look
3614615 there is a vast crowd of youngsters who prefer wearing jeans and t shirts they do not usually wear fabindia clothes and nor are they interested in home accessories we expect the jewellery to pull them to our stores the appeal of jewellery cuts across all segments
3614616 though we have eight stores in the gulf and a growing presence in the region at the moment we are not sending any jewellery out we will market it in phases as this is a new line of business for us we are trying to brand the unbranded
3614617 but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3614618 the walls looked like they were moving sometimes there were so many bugs and roaches on the wall
3614619 when the door first opened roaches fell from the ceiling down to the floor so i knew then we were in for something
3614620 there was garbage packed up to the ceiling the smell was so overwhelming the investigator had to where a gas mask
3614621 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside
3614622 chicken and chips was pretty much their diet there was evidence of some other things in there like old pizza boxes but from what i understand those were his and the kids and her were not allowed to partake
3614623 from what i understand he just left and didnt come back and she got word somehow i dont know what happened but she got word somehow that he got involved with another lady
3614624 nobody in this community knew that he had children or a wife thats whats so strange about this this family was so afraid of this man that he said they are not to leave and they did not leave
3614625 he was always talking to my son and to my boyfriend just being normal like normal people do
3614626 the latest in a sad list of serial offenses against the environment in fact its likely to be one of many attacks on the environment the american public can expect as this administration limps out the door
3614627 the very agencies that have often resisted efforts to adjust their projects to accommodate the needs of rare wildlife would now be put in charge of deciding whether any adjustment is needed
3614628 these unprecedented changes would have broad consequences imperiling hundreds of endangered species nationwide
3614629 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3614630 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3614631 it is not business as usual anymore with the russians and there are consequences for doing what they are doing
3614632 russia has one foot integrated into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in it
3614633 whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3614634 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia
3614635 but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3614636 we are not happy with the way the united states has been behaving especially the way the united states has been propping up mr saakashvili over the past few years
3614637 i hope we continue normal relations with the united states and the rest of the international community
3614638 we have equal interests between the russian federation and the united states we should look and try to resolve this international crisis
3614639 this approval and marketing agreement reflect our strategy to be first to market with the important products that make quality healthcare more affordable for our customers and drive value for our shareholders
3614640 it had big teeth a big head short legs in front and long legs in back i was raised on a ranch and id never seen anything like it
3614641 id rather be in cuero texas looking for a chupacabra
3614642 theres something going on with these animals and whatever it is its going on right here
3614643 if we run across it again then we might have to do something about it
3614644 we just havent seen anything like this in a long time
3614645 these kids have no fears about taking multiple drugs at one time
3614646 i have to be aware of the little things that got me in trouble in that game
3614647 i dont feel threatened or anything like that competition is part of the game we play
3614648 i was actually responding to a comment that was made and i guess you can kind of agree with it muhammad said
3614649 well for whatever reason it just didnt work out he said
3614650 ron has had success in different places and obviously hes a good coordinator and also lovie smith cant say enough good things about him i think the comment was taken out of context a little bit and probably blown up a little more than it should have been
3614651 but thats just how it goes sometimes in this going to be misquoted or things like that happen we pick up the pieces and try to leave on good notes i wish them well and i know they do the same for me
3614652 i dont see that happening particularly early in the year
3614653 ford has a low center of gravity and he can run
3614654 i see him getting better and better he did some really good things as well as freshman mikel leshoure
3614655 weve said all along we have four guys who can be really really good
3614656 she kept pulling up next to him and she was yelling through the open window at him still angry
3614657 when she swerved in behind him she said her car just went out of control
3614658 she hit the curb and she doesnt remember a whole lot after that
3614659 this is one year of a five year challenge and the only way were going to get there is to really look hard at every position
3614660 were very confident and very optimistic that well place all those folks somewhere else in the city
3614661 we have the ability to get them placed into other positions
3614662 i want to make sure that those services that help the neediest in our community are there
3614663 i cant think of a better reason than this to cancel my admirals club membership

3614666 my client vehemently denies the allegations we look forward to our day in court we believe we will be able to establish that sniffex is a legitimate bomb detection device
3614667 the individual defendants profited handsomely by disregarding resale restrictions and selling their scheme derived shares into the artificially inflated market
3614668 investors should be extremely cautious when considering an investment opportunity that they learn about through unsolicited email or fax stock promoters often use bulk e mail and faxes in connection with pump and dump schemes
3614669 seat belts would have made a difference in this accident because a large number of the fatalities were ejected
3614670 i know its expensive but when you see this happening over and over again you have to say too expensive for whom
3614671 these are shoddy operators who shouldnt have been on the road to begin with
3614672 im worried about the drivers how qualified they may be and what were doing to make sure the equipment is in good shape
3614673 the company did not honor the out of service order
3614674 they elected to ignore the order by reincorporating and subsequently a tragedy occurred the statutes currently exist right now to prohibit a company from operating a vehicle in an unsafe manner its a class b misdemeanor to do that

3614680 john st clair is in the starting position so i guess you could start with him
3614681 but i try not to pay attention to a lot of things in the media dont pat ourselves on the back none of us do on the o line if you start believing youre good thats when your technique falls apart
3614682 this is the nfl and ive started a lot of games against tough guys so ill be up for the challenge
3614683 your right tackle might be facing a pro bowl player and the left tackle might be facing an average guy both positions are hard you basically do the same thing every play and the technique is pretty much the same
3614684 i planned on starting somewhere anyway that was my mentality

3614702 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3614703 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3614704 he knows its an experiment and we are prepared to take the risk because he is such a good athlete roos said
3614705 ive seen a lot of athletes come and go in afl football and if to take the football component out of it hes as good an athlete thats come through if you look at his size and speed and his endurance if better than we thought after doing a pretty good 3km time trial
3614706 clearly he needs to be a great athlete just to give himself a chance the question is can he change to a different code hes never played and can he adapt to the skills

3614725 we cannot end these traditions just because there is no king
3614726 the fact that nepal is now a republic is not an excuse to drop centuries old traditions
3614727 the kumari and other festivals the king was involved in were to acknowledge the person who holds the power to protect the nation
3614728 cultural hegemony has shifted from the king to the people
3614729 its natural that these religious ceremonies are carried out by the president or prime minister
3614730 for centuries nepal has remained socially harmonious despite being a multi ethnic multi lingual and multi faith country
3614731 it was the king who was a central point of unity
3614732 holding these festivals without the king renders them totally meaningless
3614733 but if he is taking something written by somebody else and putting it together as some sort of compilation to create the book then some different inferences might flow
3614734 i dont even know why my client is wearing the thing on his head
3614735 to me its odd to him it is perfectly normal
3614736 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports he said
3614737 there were reports about presence of arab turkmen and local militants in the two hideouts run by a local commander zanjir wazir he added
3614738 at least 10 militants were killed in the strikes according to our initial reports amp squo amp squo he said

3614740 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle
3614741 the aircraft was circling over the ocean to receive a standard damage check from the other hawk pilot the spokesman said
3614742 while circulating the aircraft was also burning off fuel to reduce its landing weight
3614743 about 11am aest one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land amp squo amp squo he said

3614745 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3614746 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3614747 als die bombe einschlug flog ich in die ecke und verletzte mich am arm ich rappelte mich auf und schrie nach meiner frau leila damit sie mich und unsere tochter nino aus dem zerst rten haus bringt denn ich bin blind als wir aus dem haus waren lagen da leichen meine frau erkannte sie als unsere nachbarinnen nana und sofia und zerrte mich weg

3614762 the last five competitions this plane has won all over the world so theres no question it is a far superior plane and i think ultimately we win
3614763 the fact that these were written for children shouldnt remove them from the contest
3614764 raymond briggs uses more than 175 subtly colored neatly arranged picture frames to tell
3614765 briggs showed illustrators a new way to expand the limits of a picture book from within
3614766 certainly his lasting importance is alone assured by the critical attention he received for when the wind blows the book is almost universally recognized as one of the most touching and powerful treatments of nuclear war
3614767 its been a great day for team columbia and a really special day for linus gerdemann
3614768 the tour de lain isnt a major stage race but there are some strong teams here and lots of riders who rode the tour de france we came with a motivated and on form team and the riders proved it with how they dominated things tony was great rabon did really well and im really happy for linus
3614769 his crash in tirreno adriatico could have ended his career but hes worked hard and made a fantastic recovery winning has really boosted his moral and motivated him for the tour of germany at the end of the month
3614770 its an up and down stage and so it wont be easy to control things
3614771 this deal effectively subsidizes religious worship and instruction thus violating core constitutional principles
3614772 the establishment clause of the constitutions first amendment prohibits the provision of public aid for religious activity
3614773 the point they miss is this is a property exchange
3614774 this is about property not about the operations of the facility
3614775 it was clear that christian prayer is part of their program
3614776 it depends to what extent christian prayer is a requirement if there is a lawsuit the courts will have to decide
3614777 the biggest social services provider we have is catholic charities
3614778 we have a lot of child care providers that are tied to churches there are a number of organizations that we deal with that are church related
3614779 a music scape that oozes with primitive life as if pulsing from the swamp itself a time traveller searching for the aperture that looks back to eden
3614780 you will not finish going through the cities of israel before the son of man comes
3614781 we see enormous growth potential in the future and have solid strategies in place to support our goals
3614782 the impact of department stores tightening inventory levels gives us just as much opportunity
3614783 it helps maintain a wider pricing gap between us and the department stores and can increase average ticket
3614784 some gays shoot themselves in the foot once again in trying to be accepted like regular people wanting to live regular lives they parade their freaks for all to see proudly even these freaks are an embarrassment to those in the homosexual community who just want to live and not bring down anything in order to bring themselves up so these freaks will never have my sympathy they got their attention now they can kiss the respect that they want goodbye
3614785 the russians have clearly demonstrated their military capability of getting very close to the pipelines
3614786 and they also sent the black sea fleet off the georgian coast so they also have demonstrated that they can blockade georgia anytime they want
3614787 investors would have to reconsider how attractive those projects are
3614788 for russia control of georgia and the pipeline would restore much of its influence over many of the former satellites of the u s s r
3614789 it would have the clear benefit of increasing russias energy chokehold on europe
3614790 when the russians are trying to claw back their power energy is the major lever in their pursuit to do so
3614791 the georgian president brought in the whole pipeline issue to probably send more worries to the west and especially to the european consumers to draw more attention to the conflict
3614792 its not that we should ignore it but its certainly not a cause to panic
3614793 there were multiple complex gunshot wound sic on the left face surrounding the left eye base of nose upper cheek and forehead with laceration and blackening of the skin
3614794 burning and blackening is a feature of very close range shots probably from less than a foot away
3614795 if you see burning and soot type burning it indicates that the barrel of the gun was very close to the skins surface
3614796 satellite shaped gunshot wound on the back of the head centrally located
3614797 there has always seemed to be a split within the government so a consistent policy for dealing with russia has been absent
3614798 in the first term there were a lot of hard liners on russia who did not look kindly on cooperation
3614799 it would be great if we were to announce we are going to help the georgians rebuild as part of the compensation for their efforts in iraq
3614800 at what point does the west do something meaningful having the president backslapping with putin at the olympics is not a serious attempt to deal with the problem
3614801 the georgians who took us at our word when we talked about a partnership have got to be wondering what bush is all about
3614802 the last thing russia wants is a war with the west if they came eye to eye with nato warplanes they would retreat
3614803 i would have rather the russians hadnt responded but saakashvili sure did it and he did it in the mistaken belief i believe that he had friends in the bush administrations court
3614804 we have consistently and on thursday also urged the georgians not to move their forces in we were unambiguous about it
3614805 saakashvili had always told us he could not stand by while georgian villages were being shelled and we always knew this was a point of pressure we always told him that he should not give in to the kind of provocations we knew the russians were capable of
3614806 i think the state department was assiduous in urging restraint and saakashvilis buddies in the white house and office of the vice president kept egging him on
3614807 that allowed him to misinterpret the degree and depth of our support
3614808 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3614809 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3614810 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3614811 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3614812 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3614813 we are like an example for the others that russia can do the same to anybody
3614814 they must be stopped they wont stop by themselves theyll start with georgia and then it will be poland and estonia and ukraine
3614815 they are invading us and its happening in the 21st century and the whole world is watching
3614816 were frustrated if we were given more active support maybe russia wouldnt dare
3614817 when you see something like this it puts ice in your heart
3614818 there are no georgian soldiers left nobody can be there now
3614819 they want to keep us under control to keep us from nato they never wanted us to be independent
3614820 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3614821 they dont want to rebuild the soviet union but they do want a sphere of influence
3614822 i think this was aimed much more to the west more to ukraine central asia and the other caucasus states
3614823 i worry that any country in the region such as ukraine that has been tilting towards the u s may now think twice they may lean back a bit toward russia
3614824 for 3 1 2 centuries russia has dominated its neighborhood
3614825 throwing a gantlet down saying that there isnt going to be any more nato enlargement
3614826 i think that american officials and analysts and i would put myself in this boat underestimated the scope of the russian reaction to kosovos separation from serbia
3614827 the russians at the time said that they may well retaliate by stirring up trouble in abkhazia and south ossetia and i think many people said well thats going to be mostly talk in fact theyve gone ahead and done it
3614828 is demonstrating to the rest of the world that the united states is not the sole superpower any more or if it is its so stretched that its not going to come to your aid
3614829 that weakens the u s position globally quite a bit
3614830 oh well ive heard of that song but theyre a little before my time
3614831 spiritual awakenings were reported in the 1830s in grahamstown south africa that resulted in the gospel being taken to the native peoples of south africa in asia missionaries reported revivals and awakenings on various fields from the middle east through china including a movement among the karens in burma under the ministry of baptist missionaries in that land

3614881 sementara e banking menawarkan kemudahan tanpa batas kepada nasabah segala transaksi bisa dilakukan di rumah sendiri
3614882 sistem keamanan e banking mandiri telah mengikuti perkembangan security system yang ada seperti penggunaan user id pin triple des encripted data serta prosedur registrasi transaksi
3614883 total kredit yang diberikan sampai dengan akhir 2005 adalah rp106 8 triliun sementara dana masyarakat tumbuh 17 3 persen menjadi rp206 triliun pada akhir desember 2005 dari rp175 8 triliun di akhir 2004 lalu
3614884 ini jelas sangat menguntungkan apalagi bisnis ini hanya memiliki risiko operasional tahun 2006 fee based income ditargetkan tumbuh 15 20 persen

3614888 namun ini bukan karena indonesia memiliki teknologi perbankan yang lebih maju namun semata hanya karena perbedaan gaya hidup
3614889 e banking di eropa umumnya hanya digunakan untuk melihat saldo atau berbelanja jadi fiturnya tidak perlu banyak

3614892 hes sending the same one he sent in 2006 by making a promise and not keeping it that this is not his priority
3614893 it was our hope today that lawmakers could have started a dialogue toward finding a solution for education funding
3614894 you have the house the senate and the governors mansion and youve accomplished absolutely nothing
3614895 six years of absolute democratic control and nothing has happened
3614896 i think its a shame that we have to be pushed to the brink by public pressure to do the right thing
3614897 it is unfair that they playing with peoples lives like this this is so critical someone has to step in we cannot just throw away people like that
3614898 the bottom line is having to look at these mothers the despairing wives in the face and tell them that we cant service their loved ones its a horrible situation
3614899 its clear that this is not a serious attempt at solving the states problems the governor seems to think that the general assembly is a stage for his endless preening
3614900 it is a joke its a sham its a shame its a farce it is clearly designed to score points and it amplifies the infighting going on between house speaker mike madigan and the governor in an attempt to score political points
3614901 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet
3614902 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3614903 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3614904 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3614905 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3614906 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3614907 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3614908 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3614909 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3614910 jeden wirklich jeden morgen war natalia partyka die erste die in der halle erschienen ist noch vor dem offiziellen beginn bte sie aufschl ge und versuchte sich zu verbessern
3614911 so brutal hart habe ich lange niemanden mehr arbeiten sehen wie sie sie tut weit mehr als andere und hat schon jetzt definitiv etwas besonderes geschafft
3614912 leute die mich nicht kennen schauen zwar zun chst oft ein bisschen berrascht wenn sie mich bei turnieren sehen
3614913 meine k rperbalance mag nicht so gut sein aber meine beine sind schnell
3614914 natalia hat ein bisschen koordinative probleme man merkt es an ihrer tiefen vorhand wenn sie also den ball tief schlagen muss das ist ihr schwachpunkt wegen dem sie oft noch zur ckweicht vom tisch aber wenn sie den abstellt kann sie sicherlich noch viel erreichen
3614915 wir hoffen dass dort ihre schw chen noch zum tragen kommen
3614916 selbst bei klubs aus dem liga mittelfeld gibt es vern nftige renditeaussichten

3614924 ich freue mich dass herr tiefensee endlich in deutschland angekommen ist
3614925 wir brauchen eine gesamtdeutsche regionalpolitik die fast 20 jahre nach dem mauerfall die ost oder westdeutsche brille abnimmt
3614926 wenn bundesminister tiefensee jetzt offensichtlich auch sein herz f r die probleme von strukturschw cheren gebieten in westdeutschland entdeckt hat klingt uns das wie musik in den ohren sicher wird tiefensee seine ank ndigungen bald mit einem kr ftigen finanzf rderkonzept des bundes untermauern
3614927 bremen k mpft in der f deralismuskommission f r eine gesicherte finanzielle zukunft dass sich ein bundesminister in dieser weise zu bremerhaven u erst ist eine wichtige aussage
3614928 es ist unstrittig dass die zuk nftige f rderung sich an wirtschaftlichen notwendigkeiten von regionen und nicht mehr nach himmelsrichtungen orientieren wird
3614929 nach auslaufen des solidarpakt ii wird und soll es keine sonderregelung f r den osten mehr geben
3614930 die weitgehende aufl sung der modellreserve war angemessen weil die methodischen bewertungsrisiken aus dem cdo portfolio nunmehr berschaubar sind
3614931 wir gehen davon aus dass wir die gegebenenfalls noch erforderlichen erfolgswirksamen cdo anpassungen weitestgehend bis ende 2008 bew ltigen werden
3614932 die immer noch ungewissen marktaussichten lassen zuverl ssige prognosen kaum zu
3614933 der weitere jahresverlauf sollte diese einsch tzung grunds tzlich best tigen wenn nicht neue externe schocks allen marktteilnehmern einen strich durch die rechnung machen

3615035 i will say frankly that in my judgment the entire indian policy of the country is wrong from its very inception in the first place you offer a premium for rascality by paying a beggarly pittance to your indian agents the gentleman from massachusetts mr butler may denounce the sentiment as atrocious but i will say that i like an indian better dead than living i have never in my life seen a good indian and i have seen thousands except when i have seen a dead indian

3615045 a number of their dead placed upon scaffolds or tied to the branches of trees were disturbed and robbed of their trinkets several persons rode about exhibiting their trinkets with as much gusto as if they were trophies of their valor and showed no c concern for their desecration than if they had won them at a raffle ten days later i saw the bodies of these same persons dead naked and mutilated graham 129

3615051 there could be a prime minister without a security background but it is neither wise nor correct israeli prime minister is a sensitive position that requires a massive amount of experience including on security issues we saw just two years ago the fruit of inexperience and the decisions made then are being judged now
3615052 i will say it for the last time i will absolutely not run for re election nor will i head any political list to the senate
3615053 if the people families are tightening their belts then the government will do the same
3615054 yeah theres a lot of time and financial resources invested in improving water quality condition and particularly in terms of investing in that river frontage or riparian strip
3615055 and we need to be confident that the recommended practises that are being proposed are both socially acceptable and soundly based
3615056 theres not much point scientists proposing recommended practises if farmers dont find them acceptable and its also important to see what land holders understand about the links between these practices and the water quality outcomes
3615057 they might have different understandings of things than the scientists
3615058 we need to seek a consensus among all sectors and seek accords that benefit people who have been exploited and mistreated
3615059 the progress in iraq has allowed us to continue our policy of return on success we now have brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units that were sent to iraq as part of the surge we remain a nation at war al qaeda is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again

3615061 the separation of church and state an important principle to be preserved does not mean that we can or should keep faith perspectives from influencing political decisions or vice versa we cannot profess to be a free society and a representative democracy and impose a de facto ban on expression or consideration of spiritual views in the political arena

3615081 there is lots of information available online and at the library i think it is difficult at times to find factual information
3615082 help us if you can but most importantly use the information
3615083 most of the information is already out there we just collect it and put it in the same place

3615086 a number of people didnt vote because of the pick a party system who are going to vote this time

3615100 i wrongly remembered my time as that of the third group but actually it was the second group
3615101 im sure a lot of belgians feel it is unfair the champions of a country have to play a qualifying round to get into the champions league
3615102 it is going to be a very difficult two matches to qualify for the next stage of the champions league
3615103 people here in belgium were probably hoping for a more favourable draw but we are still relishing the opportunity to play against liverpool
3615104 we definitely respect liverpool they are a great and huge club they have a great history especially in terms of the champions league so we will have our work cut out for us
3615105 hopefully we will be able to rise to the occasion in the two matches that lay ahead there is always belief
3615106 im sure that the people of liverpool are probably happy with the draw and hopefully we can use that to our advantage
3615107 you never know in football we have a lot of good players here
3615108 obviously the belgian league is not as respected as the premier league but i feel that we have quality players that can possibly make a difference on any given day
3615109 any win against liverpool is going to be a big win but for me it was so because it was my first start at home and first win with them
3615110 it will always stay a big souvenir for me in terms of my newcastle experience but that is in the past and i tend not to dwell on the past too much and try to concentrate on the future
3615111 a lot has changed at liverpool a lot of different players have come into that team
3615112 fernando torres is a great player and i had the opportunity to play against him this summer when the us played against spain
3615113 it was 1 0 to spain torres played the first half and at the end of that it was 0 0
3615114 personally i think i defended pretty well against him although he was also coming off an injury so he probably wasnt at 100
3615115 he has a lot of different tricks in his arsenal and you have to be on your toes at all times and concentrate
3615116 but there is not just one player that we have to be aware of it is the whole squad
3615117 ive always said that my ambitions are to leave belgium for a bigger league if that be england then that would be great
3615118 ive matured a lot and progressed in a lot of different factors and aspects of my game since 2007
3615119 i feel as though i had a short stint in order to adapt to the style of the premier league
3615120 sometimes it takes players six to eight months to get used to the premier league style

3615125 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3615126 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3615127 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3615128 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3615129 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3615130 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3615131 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3615132 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3615133 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3615134 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3615135 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3615136 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3615137 when you pulverize the world record by more than three seconds that is remarkable and is only happening very seldom when four superstars are at the peak of their performance
3615138 when technology is used in a sport it is important to be in control of the way it is being developed and where it might lead us
3615139 its a great suit for me putting the suit on mentally its time to go fast
3615140 if i had to design a pool this is what it would look like
3615141 the old timers believe it is really the swimmer and the coach
3615142 it has more to do with the four of us than the pool
3615143 i think the pool is fantastic but i think we had an awesome race and we were pushed by the french and the australians i think we all just came together thats how we were able to go so fast
3615144 i wish i could compare results from the 70s 80s and 90s to the current results to know exactly how they are improving because of the suits technology and training
3615145 you probably cant stop technology from coming into any sport if athletes want to swim faster technology will always be there i dont see it as bad its good for the popularity of swimming it gets more people interested in sport and what is the goal of sport a healthier nation

3615151 we are called to manifest the continued presence of the risen lord in every age he in his sacred humanity showed us how to live i could go on at length on the implications of this but the point is that no matter what arena we find ourselves in including political debate we do not take off our catholic christian faith as though it is a cloak we wear only at mass
3615152 this split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age

3615215 elementary my dear pruner the power and the glory of keeping it simple sir
3615216 i cant necessarily attack facebook or myspace but i can attack their users all day long
3615217 dont put anything on a facebook account that you dont consider public
3615218 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
3615219 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
3615220 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
3615221 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that
3615222 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3615223 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3615224 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3615225 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3615226 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3615227 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3615228 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3615229 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together

3615233 its just too hard for one nurse to take care of them both because they feed off each other and make too much work for the nurse
3615234 too bad because afterso many weeks in the hospital being miserable sick and scared that they finally wound up in a room where they got along with the person in the bed next to them so much so that they were actually cheering up making each other feel better and in turn getting better

3615238 monty did it all out of pure love of the craft
3615239 he was such a well rounded theater artist because he did it all
3615240 i never heard monty say a bad thing about anybody

3615261 sidang ditunda sampai tanggal 20 agustus 2008 karena hakim belum siap materinya
3615262 we gave that team a lot of time and a lot of space you see what a good team can do with time and space
3615263 it was a bit of a fortunate bounce i guess but at the time thats what we needed
3615264 we had some guys that could have done better than they did
3615265 if they had done that we could have had a different result
3615266 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off
3615267 we think byrd can add that veteran presence and some stability to our rotation
3615268 hes been on a roll since the all star break hes been pretty darn good every time out there this is a guy whos been through this before and someone we think can be dependable and we know what were going to get every fifth day
3615269 it seemed like the right time to add this guy you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august or september because theres very little you can do about it so this was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran we feel we can trust
3615270 i changed my glove and its rock hard so if i cover first ill be in trouble but i cant wiggle it and give away what i think what was happening a little bit
3615271 i changed my motion so i wasnt going over my head with my hands anymore
3615272 im throwing a little better breaking ball now and ive gotten left handers out a lot better over the last five games
3615273 ive had an up and down season its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident i like the way im throwing the ball i have no fear no wonder about which pitcher is going to show up i feel really good about where i am right now and i think that probably had something to do with why the red sox picked me up
3615274 im really excited to be with a great team thats in a pennant race here
3615275 im a big fan of tito and i think the red sox have a great thing going its really hard to be disappointed about anything that boston offers and ill be there tomorrow and get ready to go under way
3615276 its nice he wont be overwhelmed by anything we can throw at him in this environment in october if were lucky enough to get there we know who paul byrd is hes going to consistently locate and throw strikes and change speeds and show great feel on the mound we think we might be getting him at the right time
3615277 id like to avoid the dl but the doc said its a possibility i think right now its probably too early today after the mri theyll have a lot more information
3615278 its definitely bad when one of your key players is out but hopefully we have guys who will step in and play
3615279 if i play third and sean casey plays first thats still a pretty good team there
3615280 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz far from it
3615281 we still think hes going to be a huge part of our future and may well prove to be an important part of our present
3615282 that said we think this move gives us freedom to do the right thing with our rotation rather than forcing people into roles because of injury well see how things play out but by no means is clay buchholz out of our picture
3615283 when hes able to pitch healthy thats when well pitch him
3615284 nunca imagin que hubiese tanta gente en el mundo interesada en esta m sica
3615285 get off my back about this im trying to get up my nerve here
3615286 the fencing being put in place is in many cases mesh fencing to allow our officers to see whats happening on the other side and to better secure the border

3615288 thank you for your insane investment or i should say irrational investment
3615289 hi every one welcome to my new club penguin site
3615290 look mommy theres a waterfall on the roof and and a lake on the deck
3615291 are you smoking crack we just got a hannah montana birthday invitation in the mail today
3615292 we talked about breaking seven minutes and we had two guys who averaged 1 45 or better they really did it and pulled it out for the team
3615293 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3615294 i wanted the world record i wanted a 1 51 or better but given the circumstances its not too bad i guess
3615295 he wont appreciate the history of what is happening here until later maybe years later
3615296 starting with preschool teachers complained michael couldnt stay quiet at quiet time michael wouldnt sit at circle time michael didnt keep his hands to himself michael was giggling and laughing and nudging kids for attention
3615297 more to the point i think is the moral of her story which offers hope for parents of any child with a challenge like a d h d too many adults looked at ms phelpss boy and saw what he couldnt do this week the world will be tuned to the beijing olympics to see what he can do
3615298 oh yay sunday drive in the middle of go karting
3615299 oh well do you miss this or do you miss that
3615300 oh well ive been thinking this past week and i miss you alot
3615301 omg i cant wait to see this movie i love mummies
3615302 omg those black people are so f cking annoying make them shut up
3615303 so eva i heard you were hooking up with darren yesterday
3615304 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3615305 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3615306 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3615307 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3615308 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behaviour that looks like its from another time
3615309 what annoys me about springsteen young and martin in particular is that they never debate the issues they never show us exactly how deep their political thinking is how wide their frame of reference is instead they yell out dumb stuff to their zombie followers and revel in the applause overseas especially any knock on america is greeted with rapture
3615310 generally dont go in for this kind of stuff because their audience has little tolerance for it
3615311 the moscow authorities will use this opportunity to remind ukraine of the damages of allying itself with nato
3615312 there will be no impact on the residents of kurnell through the operation of this rig
3615313 if people are affected by the existing drilling out at kurnell then they only have to ring sydney water if they want to be relocated
3615314 and they will be relocated for the period of the drilling weve made that commitment
3615315 i have every confidence the whales will swim around it
3615316 i think it is most likely to have an effect on the marine life there
3615317 one big main point is to have a bigger sharper focus on sydney

3615327 i think that reflects the importance of agriculture and agriculture dependent jobs on the local economy
3615328 we just didnt have the tonnage to make this thing pencil out which makes for a challenging year
3615329 this year a lot of packing sheds were running one 8 hour shift every other day
3615330 but thats not much our local economy is virtually flat
3615331 theres a lot of activity in this part of the river
3615332 i just have a big problem taking away peoples rights that they have today
3615333 if there is a lot of saharan dust surrounding the storm there is a possibility of dry dusty air being injected into the storm which really helps make the storm more disorganized
3615334 the dust is still on the western fringes of the disturbed weather but over time as the dust dissipates the storm will get better organized and have a better chance of developing
3615335 its not well understood yet exactly what the dust does but it does seem to cause trouble for hurricanes
3615336 this storm is surrounded on three sides by dry air it would have been a tropical depression by now if it werent for the dry air around it
3615337 anytime we have a system getting that close in the bahamas we certainly need to be paying attention to it in florida
3615338 conditions look favorable for development in the next couple of days if you dont have your supplies already you should get them
3615339 i think the town is actually in a better position than it was before the hurricane
3615340 every summer we didnt have a horrific hurricane it got easier
3615341 mentally im over it i think the town has come a long way in the last year i think the town is actually in a better position than it was before the hurricane
3615342 we never saw the old school so we dont know what were missing
3615343 they call it the ghetto the projects but this is a nice place for kids
3615344 weve got a lot of veterans at corner and safety
3615345 any of us can be the guy all of us can get it done
3615346 i think marcus is an all american candidate and can challenge for defensive player of the year
3615347 i think he can play that well hes going to be playing a more natural position and hell play well for us
3615348 hes full speed all the time hes going in there hes not going to hesitate
3615349 were so worried about that and these young safeties have been playing so good
3615350 the biggest surprise of the whole camp has been jonathan williams hes challenging for playing time at both the strong and weak safety
3615351 hes a high school kid and they just took advantage of him
3615352 he just made a couple of mistakes on balks stepping off the wrong way once they figured out he was slow going to the plate he just hasnt had that much experience against these college players
3615353 i was just trying to put it in play yesterday in our game we didnt have a lot of hits back to back we had hits with runners in scoring position just timely hits that helped us score thats what i was trying to do
3615354 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3615355 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3615356 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3615357 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3615358 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3615359 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3615360 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3615361 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3615362 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3615363 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3615364 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3615365 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3615366 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3615367 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3615368 tukaani is finnish for the toucan bird species the sterling silver tukaani is a hand made eating device for oriental food consumers in the west it may be held as traditional chopsticks but unlike the disposable wooden chopsticks tukaani is both machine and hand washable and much easier to set on and use at table the matt surface and taut movement allow steady grip in the hand the curl at the end of the tukaani provides eased food picking and delivery to the mouth the loop also allows easier hanging storage and display the toucans bill provided inspiration for this cutlery project

3615373 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3615374 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3615375 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
3615376 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3615377 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
3615378 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time
3615379 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3615380 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3615381 companies that take an architectural approach to business continuity planning are ultimately the most resilient
3615382 its essential to start at the top and work through all levels of the business to determine the critical interconnection points between people processes technologies suppliers and customers
3615383 we have an additional responsibility to cbeyonds public shareholders now
3615384 we need to ensure them along with our customers partners and employees that we can keep the business running even if we have issues with our main production data center
3615385 in getting started you need to develop an in depth understanding of what is really needed to serve customers and generate revenue
3615386 once you have identified the essential elements that must be protected first it becomes a lot easier to prioritize other components and outsource or get rid of non essential items
3615387 tracing the links between departments business functions and applications is vital to determining how long you can be without certain areas without causing irreparable harm to the business
3615388 you need to take all your applications and put them into different buckets and then rank their importance from a business perspective
3615389 in assessing value first determine what level of downtime and data loss is acceptable next assess how long you can survive without having access to these core applications and critical data
3615390 its not just a case of protecting the crucial corporate databases anymore now that email has become the lifeblood of many organizations
3615391 no matter the size or business segment all companies are vulnerable to the potentially devastating effects of losing mission critical data unless they have a solid business continuity plan in place
3615392 at some point most companies will reach zero tolerance for any application downtime or data loss which will put continuous data protection cdp products in the limelight
3615393 its important to recognize that not all applications are of equal value to the organization
3615394 the goal is to take measured steps that balance technology requirements with business needs to lower risks reduce complexities and keep operations up and running in the event of a failure
3615395 in assessing our needs it was clear that backup and recovery was the first line of defense
3615396 to reduce complexities while delivering enterprise class data protection we replaced our current backup environment with bakbones netvault backup
3615397 we weighed the costs and advantages of being able to instantly failover to a secondary site
3615398 it all came down to reducing risks while increasing resiliency
3615399 we now have complete fail over between our production and development environments which greatly enhances our ability to quickly recover from a catastrophic disruption
3615400 technology should be an enabler that supports a series of best business practices
3615401 once you have the right tools you can reduce vulnerabilities while being flexible enough to adapt the plan to ever changing corporate environments
3615402 testing is crucial so is communicating what youre doing to the rest of the organization
3615403 if you want to turn business resiliency into a top corporate asset you need to make the commitment both in time and resources to do all the systems and process analyses and then be serious about supporting all the steps along the way
3615404 weve really been saddled with an entirely new responsibility to go along with our day jobs

3615433 our new tru saver bundle puts pressure on big mobile carriers to change their outlandishly expensive pricing models
3615434 were bringing a world of change to the market just as alternative providers revolutionized pricing in wire line long distance calling truphone is revolutionizing international calling for mobile phone users because we carry the calls over available wi fi networks and the internet and roaming charges are out entirely in short truphone is bringing the first step of equal access to the mobile phone for consumers and business users this means savings and cost control that they never saw before
3615435 whether theyre calling back to the u s and canada from business trips or from foreign holidays tru saver calls can be made at the same 1 5 cents per minute from anywhere in the world
3615436 since truphone uses both wi fi and gsm networks based on whichever is available many users will actually reduce their carrier billed mobile minutes while increasing the total amount of minutes they actually spend talking thanks to truphones lower rates for calls that terminate on a wi fi connected truphone mobile phone

3615445 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
3615446 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

3615539 it paralyzed him for a little bit but hes walking around pretty good now thats good news thats the only good news we got tonight
3615540 the concern was there and youre hoping for the best
3615541 it hit him good and theres not a lot of meat on those bones
3615542 hes a great competitor and i like the way he goes about his business
3615543 the guys a 300 plus hitter every year for a reason
3615544 i put him in a hitters count and hes not going to make a mistake
3615545 if hes not the best young pitcher in the league then i dont know who is
3615546 hes very difficult several different pitches explosive fastball tough curveball that keeps you off balance
3615547 hes a lot like roy when roy first came up
3615548 if he learns to pitch like roy has hes going to be tougher all the time
3615549 its the first time id been a part of a win in a long time
3615550 i didnt think id be as nervous as i was
3615551 i swung at pitches i shouldnt have and took some pitches i probably should have swung at
3615552 we expected dunn to solidify the middle of the order and take some pressure off the other guys
3615553 he did that and solidified the four hole in the lineup
3615554 he gave up the two but after that he was pretty stingy
3615555 just enough mistakes across the board to put us down two runs at the end of the night
3615556 usually you try to lay down on a bunt in that situation but not when a guy is throwing 98 and has a pretty good curveball
3615557 i took a swing thinking that anything can happen in this park and it did
3615558 it was away but it was probably a little too high
3615559 my slider got better and the location of my fastball the key was putting a zero up after we went ahead 4 2
3615560 chances in the fifth and seventh innings we couldnt convert
3615561 its strange when it happens but obviously you have to find a way to win the game
3615562 it didnt go foul so we have to battle and preserve the tie game
3615563 delmon hitting the big three run homer that was pretty doggone exciting
3615564 its just unfortunate that we couldnt come up with another run after that
3615565 we hit into five double plays mo gives up three runs
3615566 you see things youve never seen before when youre going through struggles like we are right now and you really come to expect the unexpected you just have to battle back
3615567 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
3615568 i dont feel i really have that much control over all that
3615569 all you can do is put up good numbers and help your team win as a player thats really all you can do theres no reason to go about being grumpy if you keep an upbeat attitude something good will come out of it in the end
3615570 its just now getting to where i can make a little bit of money doing it
3615571 plus im single i have no kids its very easy for me to pack up and move to different places its a good way to travel and see the world and not spend a lot of money in fact they pay you to do it
3615572 hes kind of the heart and soul of our team here
3615573 hes really important to us he hits third he hits for a high average hes got a rare mix of that and power he drives in runs he hits with two outs he can steal bases he can score from first on a double he makes our lineup a lot better and defensively hes great so he can really do it all for us
3615574 brent is one of those guys who needs to play every day
3615575 when youre a guy that an organization doesnt have a lot of money invested in you dont get as much playing time and its tough to get into a rhythm every year he starts off with us kind of cold until he has about 20 games under his belt you dont have that luxury in the minor leagues unless youre a first or second round kid theyve invested a lot of money in he does well here because he knows hes getting his four or five at bats every night
3615576 whenever i get up in the morning and i dont want to go to the field or its game day and i dont want to go play i might retire
3615577 but as of right now im still enjoying it and i want to keep making more contacts throughout playing baseball so that whenever my playing days are over i can get into coaching
3615578 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3615579 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3615580 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3615581 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3615582 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3615583 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3615584 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3615585 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3615586 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3615587 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3615588 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3615589 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3615590 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3615591 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3615664 the judges had no reasons to hold her up but they were not allowed to start
3615665 they got a signal from somewhere that it was not time to start it was totally unusual that is all i can say
3615666 i was nervous and wanted to get the show on the road and i let my nerves get the best of me there was no sign with her name on the scoreboard signaling she could start her routine just a blank screen it felt like it took forever for mine name to come up
3615667 i tried to look past the fall off beam and do the best i could on floor
3615668 i dont know what happened i felt my feet were underneath me and the next thing i knew i was on my back
3615669 we do the training and try to become tough but we did not succeed
3615670 it gets you out of everyday camp feel i think it will be exciting to go out there and prove we are capable of competing against another football team
3615671 have good weather you can practice longer practice more efficiently
3615672 i think the players the frame of mind they are in is better
3615673 this has been a great place and if were going to come back i would be more than happy
3615674 were looking forward to going to denver we had great work with them last year
3615675 that opportunity again to go against another team during training camp i think it is going to be a really good experience for us
3615676 its good hes showing power but he needs to get on base and walk hes got gap power but hes not a home run hitter
3615677 because whoevers going to be back there is going to protect the ball
3615678 he needs to learn to just get his foot in the ground and turn upfield more
3615679 the sad part about it is weve addressed it over and over in practice
3615680 its not like we didnt see this coming he wasnt even hit on the turnover against the broncos he just dropped it
3615681 they get on me all the time and theyre right its something ive got to change
3615682 in track people arent trying to take your head off
3615683 sometimes its not there when you try to make something out of nothing thats when you have a catastrophe but well get it corrected hell get it corrected
3615684 im going to have a conversation with him before he goes on the field every time
3615685 hell be the last one to find out what the return call is hell have to come to me and get it and then well go over everything he needs to be thinking about
3615686 he could get away from some of that stuff in college
3615687 he knows his stuff hes a gifted athlete god gave him the gift of speed and athleticism and hes going to do a good job
3615688 the big issue here is that he wants to make a big play every time he touches the ball
3615689 were going to change him were tired of talking about it weve been teaching softly and now its going to get a little harder hes still swinging the ball around and we cant have that
3615690 the bottom line is hes not going back there anymore if he turns the ball over
3615691 i know i need to do something but im just too scared to face it
3615692 i loved that big slide you didnt winned mommy i was the winner

3615694 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3615695 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3615696 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3615697 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3615698 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3615699 do not go back and own the groups by your self most of the chairpersons and secretaries tend to own the groups by their self and if the report reach my office you will be replace with immediate effect
3615700 my goggles pretty much filled with water and it kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
3615701 but i wanted to break the record i wanted to 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad

3615724 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
3615725 while i have full confidence that new zealand will start growing again later this year no one should expect that once growth returns the world will keep ticking along as it has for the past two decades

3615729 seen you jockin j c cause he got a mercedes and you know about his ladies
3615730 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3615731 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3615732 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3615733 the internet community has become very polarized either you liked this book or you hated this book we took a stance that if you liked the book were going to be a place for discussion about that
3615734 we know that it was a disgruntled fan of the series who hacked our system it took place as a direct result of the lexicons backing of stephenie meyer and her work
3615735 if you were posting on every thread on our forums stephenie meyer is a terrible writer everything about it is horrible then we just arent the place for you
3615736 as her official fan site this needs to be a positive place where we can gather together and discuss what we like and have positive conversation hate spam makes it very difficult for someone to enjoy the site
3615737 if you hit the site with enough traffic its security measures begin to fall the message board had been spammed and it allowed a hole in the security net that somebody was able to get through and delete forums
3615738 because of the spamming there were so many ip addresses there is no shortage of suspects and no way to know which one exactly did the attack
3615739 the hole that enabled them to get into the blog has been sealed as far as contacting law enforcement we have been in contact with our server company and there are definite measures being taken to ensure that this doesnt happen again
3615740 its a very difficult time for the fandom in that you liked it or you really hated it everyone feels like they need to get their say but that means that the fans that really liked it need to have their site too the blog is that place for these ladies and a few men who have been worshipping this book for years
3615741 for those who were disappointed go be passionate about something else
3615742 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3615743 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3615744 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3615745 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3615746 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3615747 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3615748 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better

3615756 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3615757 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3615758 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3615759 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3615760 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3615761 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3615762 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3615763 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3615764 the end of the military operation does not mean russia has shown leniency to saakashvili
3615765 there can be no return to the status quo that existed before the incursion of georgian forces in south ossetia which is now insisted upon by a mortally frightened saakashvili and his western protector
3615766 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3615767 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3615768 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3615769 i dont think any of us believe what we say we believe its just our neurons responding to a phrase or something a learned response that makes us feel warm for some reason that goes back to childhood and in the end it doesnt matter were motes of dust on a tiny insignificant planet spinning around in a solar system so vast our minds cant comprehend it and one day the planet will implode and all will be lost beethoven plato monet the minnesota twins and it wont make any difference to the cosmos whatsoever so why should we care who wins the election in november
3615770 should deeply worry anyone interested in a sane us foreign policy or the safety of their children
3615771 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire
3615772 this is a guy who grew up in the cold war was a military person and an honorable man but has not changed his ways of thinking about russia
3615773 explaining with precision what we dont like about their behavior rather than saying he looked into putins eyes and saw kgb that has an adolescent quality that gets us exactly nowhere
3615774 indonesia belum setuju sebelum ada kompensasinya yang ditawarkan new zealand mereka menginginkan dibebaskan mereka hanya capacity building itu yang menyebabkan indonesia belum menerima

3615782 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
3615783 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
3615784 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast

3615787 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3615788 during the asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt provide us an opportunity to check the security arrangements so there was no way we can formulate an opinion on rawalpindi
3615789 we are trying to explore whether we might use only lahore and karachi and take a decision soon
3615790 it was a very constructive meeting very informative the attitude and willingness of the pakistan government officials to implement security measures was very positive
3615791 we held two trial matches where akhtar proved his fitness and he is willing to return and since he is determined he is an asset for pakistan
3615792 i am gearing up for the champions trophy after putting the terrible last few months behind me
3615793 his lawyer has argued that akhtar can pay the fine once the appeal against the reduced ban is heard in the court so we have decided to keep the legal matter and cricket separate
3615794 we rested akmal and he too showed improvement in the trial matches so we have included him
3615795 since we would miss yousuf we have included a specialist batsman bazid khan and have also brought in opener khalid latif

3615802 the most important thing we wanted to express to the new class was how much this community would support them we added the geyser to illustrate the rush of excitement the freshmen would be feeling as they start the year
3615803 it doesnt make me feel safe or supported thats for sure
3615804 it makes me feel like someone is gonna come up behind me rockin a chubby and the geyser cmon it freaks me out

3615807 frequently text messages the illinois senator with whom hes been friends for many years
3615808 ive spent more time with senator mccain he did my tv show then sic i have with senator obama
3615809 i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support senator obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3615810 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or
3615811 its like dropping an area of new york into an area that is really victorian two storey terraces
3615812 the terraced cottages are going to be swamped and all our light is mainly from the front
3615813 my neighbour is only going to get two hours of light a day there are only a small number of us but we are very irate
3615814 we believe that incorporating facilities such as student accommodation that benefit the whole community as well as the clubs is the right way forward
3615815 the central goal of this strategy is to ensure there are no surprises for anyone at any stage of the process

3615825 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own

3615828 i hope one day this conformity of american anti cultural racial slobs and mindless dopes will have you as a leader to lead under a banner of understanding wisdow friendship bonds and hope to bring more light to the darker times ahead and to illuminate the path on which we all choose
3615829 i want my five dollars delivered to me in euroes
3615830 this almost a tough choice for me personally to make
3615831 you said it brother there arent many left to look up to
3615832 if some one bombed your house would you attempt to fight them just a casual fist fight
3615833 i fail to se ehow its influenced racism and hate but yes your argument has logic behind it

3615840 the narmada project saw kbl faced with a never before seen technological challenge with a combination of research innovation and team work combined with the best of breed cad technology of ptcs pro engineer kbls engineering division was able to successfully overcome this challenge
3615841 the most significant result of this project has been the enrichment of the lives of thousands of people living in over 4 000 drought affected villages in the area while also lowering operating costs of the system
3615842 we are pleased to be a part of this social initiative with kirloskar brothers ltd with the successful completion of the saurashtra branch canal project ptc has reiterated its commitment to providing best in class solutions that not only address the business needs of our customers but also enable them to overcome unique technological and innovation challenges
3615843 we are particularly proud to be associated with a project that has such a major impact on the lives and livelihood of thousands of farmers
3615844 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3615845 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3615846 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3615847 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3615848 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3615849 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3615850 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3615851 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3615852 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because of the chemistry it may have broader ramifications
3615853 many biological systems depend on hydrogen bonds but we assumed that they only formed one bond this new entity has the capability to form two hydrogen bonds that have the strength of a covalent bond could this also be found in biological systems and if so what would it mean
3615854 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
3615855 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
3615856 using x rays to find solutions to earth science questions is an area that has been highly active on the srs at daresbury laboratory for some time we are very excited that the srs has contributed to answering such long standing questions about the earth in this way
3615857 the resources available at daresburys srs for high pressure research have been crucial in helping us determine the origin of these diamonds and their inclusions
3615858 these ice cores reveal that west antarcticas climate is influenced by atmospheric and oceanic changes thousands of miles to the north
3615859 these results help put antarcticas recent climate trends into a global context
3615860 these results are the first to demonstrate that we can unambiguously detect that influence in ice core records
3615861 the city of new york joins the worlds leading corporations in providing a complete accurate accounting of its carbon emissions the strategies it is employing to mitigate those emissions and the results of its efforts through the carbon disclosure project and iclei
3615862 icleis partnership with the carbon disclosure project underscores how crucial standards quantification methods and voluntary reporting are to local climate action
3615863 this project provides the opportunity for transparency and is essential in the emerging national and global policy dialogue as the priorities of local governments to achieve swift and deep reductions are identified and advanced by local government leaders
3615864 the city of new york joins the worlds leading corporations in providing a complete accurate accounting of its carbon emissions the strategies it is employing to mitigate those emissions and the results of its efforts through the carbon disclosure project and iclei this partnership between the worlds major corporations and increasingly its cities highlights the importance of the cooperative action needed to successfully counter climate change working together and with the best data we can manage this problem and leave our children and grandchildren a healthier and more sustainable planet
3615865 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
3615866 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
3615867 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
3615868 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
3615869 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
3615870 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
3615871 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
3615872 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
3615873 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
3615874 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
3615875 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
3615876 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
3615877 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
3615878 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3615879 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3615880 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3615881 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3615882 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3615883 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
3615884 i should be there by now did i make the wrong turn
3615885 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3615886 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3615887 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3615888 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3615889 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3615890 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3615891 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3615892 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3615893 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3615894 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself
3615895 if for this life only we have hoped in christ we are of all men most to be pitied but in fact christ has been raised from the dead the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep

3615899 not only could gene similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3615900 oral contraceptives totally disrupt the normal hormonal cascade when the hormonal system is disrupted cardiovascular disease cancer fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome and other serious illnesses will increase my clinical experience has clearly shown that it is impossible to adequately treat these illnesses if there is an imbalanced hormonal system
3615901 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3615902 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3615903 by providing ocean measurements under the sea ice the seals are helping us to establish the global ocean observing system we need to detect and understand changes in the ocean

3615909 for this i came into the world to testify to the truth
3615910 today as in the past it is not enough to be more or less like everyone else and to think like everyone else our lives have a deeper purpose we need god the god who has shown us his face and opened his heart to us jesus christ if we christians call him the one universal mediator of salvation valid for everyone and needed by everyone it is because we are gripped by him who has touched our hearts and lavished gifts upon us so that we in turn can offer them to others thus our faith is decisively opposed to the attitude of resignation that considers man incapable of truth this attitude i am convinced lies at the heart of the crisis of the west if truth does not exist for man then neither can we distinguish between good and evil truth proves itself in love it is never our property never our product just as love can never be produced but only received and handed on as a gift we need this inner force of truth we are its witnesses we must hand it on as a gift in the same way we received it as it has given itself to us

3615929 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
3615930 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
3615931 moreover prolonged viewing of media violence can lead to emotional desensitization toward violence in real life
3615932 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
3615933 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing

3615992 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3615993 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3615994 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3615995 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3615996 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3615997 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3615998 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3615999 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3616000 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3616001 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3616002 accionas tatanka wind farm is representative of yet another step in harnessing the abundant wind energy reserves available in americas rural midwest this land and its pioneering population long known for providing crops and livestock to feed a country now meet an urgent and monumental american need energy independence were so proud and grateful to partner with the people of north and south dakota on this project
3616003 harnessing a plentiful domestic energy resource like wind to generate electricity provides this country with sustainable and clean energy choices beyond costly natural gas and carbon emitting coal the utilization of accionas proven wind turbine technology at the tatanka wind farm is an important milestone in the companys commitment to reducing the worlds co2 emissions by 220 million tons in the next 23 years
3616004 you passed on project a but id like to see if youre interested in project b
3616005 the fcc has mandated that wireless carriers provide for eight hour power back up solutions for their grid powered networks
3616006 as our customers work to develop power solutions for their networks to comply with the fccs mandate bci will provide a wide array of power options that meet their back up power needs including hydrogen fuel cells micro turbines solar and wind power solutions
3616007 these new product and service offerings will seamlessly integrate with our existing network installation and technical services business
3616008 installation of power systems is not new to bci we have many years of experience in the installation of back up power systems primarily generators and batteries and this makes the addition of the green energy group a natural extension of our expertise
3616009 we welcome stenia and rich to our bci team and we are confident their wealth of industry knowledge and experience will represent significant assets to our company and our customers as we grow our green energy group
3616010 by working with johnson controls oak ridge national laboratory will achieve its long term energy reduction goals far earlier than expected while saving millions of taxpayer dollars
3616011 we are dedicated to alternative energy sources being able to tap renewable energy for our facility is a great way to see our purpose realized
3616012 one year ago secretary bodman challenged the entire u s department of energy to meet or exceed the presidents goals for increasing energy efficiency decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the use of renewable energy in the federal government
3616013 im proud to announce doe is delivering with alternative financing methods that reduce the need for federal spending
3616014 this project is a great example of what can happen when strong leadership combines with innovative solutions
3616015 together oak ridge national laboratory and johnson controls have developed a long term plan for success
3616016 nfs is a great addition to the b and w portfolio complementing the nuclear products and services we currently provide
3616017 b and w and nfs have been major contributors in both the government and commercial nuclear industries for the past five decades this acquisition better aligns both companies in delivering the future applications of nuclear energy
3616018 air products supports the ideals of the hydrogen tour 08
3616019 air products supports the ideals of the hydrogen tour 08 we have been involved with so many demonstration projects in the u s and around the world we have worked closely with all the automobile manufacturers on the tour and applaud the dedication they have shown to hydrogen enabled cars at the same time we have been integral to the advancements in hydrogen storage compression and fueling technology
3616020 the technology and varied applications for the use of hydrogen continue to develop and grow
3616021 it has been exciting to be part of this forward moving market at the same time we have participated in diverse hydrogen energy projects with start up companies universities and public sector agencies we are currently working with several entities to advance generation of hydrogen from renewable sources hydrogen will benefit the environment for use in numerous applications and we are particularly excited about off road vehicle activity hydrogen when delivered in typical fueling station quantities is cost competitive with gasoline
3616022 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3616023 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3616024 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3616025 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3616026 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3616027 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3616028 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3616029 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3616030 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3616031 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3616032 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3616033 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3616034 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3616035 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3616036 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3616037 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3616038 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3616039 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning its embarrassing
3616040 but we know our team is capable of fighting back
3616041 this was a game that i think potentially could have been a major downer for us
3616042 and we actually turned around and made it actually a great win
3616043 if they didnt quit tonight i dont think theyre ever going to quit
3616044 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3616045 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3616046 before it was psychological suffocation of kashmir but now its an actual on the ground suffocation
3616047 the fact of the matter is kashmir is an integral part of india hindus are a majority here
3616048 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3616049 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3616050 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3616051 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3616052 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3616053 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3616054 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3616055 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3616056 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3616057 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3616058 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3616059 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3616060 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3616061 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3616062 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3616063 it solidifies us as the place to go for the cool stuff
3616064 we do believe that broadening our assortment and having iphone in our stores is certainly going to be very important
3616065 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3616066 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3616067 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3616068 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3616069 i am very passionate about encouraging an enterprising spirit and decided to work with leonard cheshire disability to set up the award in 2007
3616070 arriving at a shortlist proved a difficult task just because there are so many talented entrepreneurs out there the judges decided to award first prize to amar because we felt his all round level of entrepreneurial skills was exceptionally high
3616071 with 50 per cent of disabled adults out of work removing barriers disabled people face in business is essential self employment is the only viable option for many disabled people as it offers flexibility and helps bypass much of the prejudice that sadly still exists
3616072 we have already received some great entries but wed like to see even more disabled entrepreneurs log on and enter to win this fantastic prize
3616073 this is a wonderful opportunity to tell leonard cheshire disability and the judging panel about your success story and how 50 000 will make a difference to your business
3616074 the awards help to highlight the barriers and opportunities disabled people face when they start a business
3616075 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3616076 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3616077 there has always seemed to be a split within the government so a consistent policy for dealing with russia has been absent
3616078 in the first term there were a lot of hard liners on russia who did not look kindly on cooperation
3616079 it would be great if we were to announce we are going to help the georgians rebuild as part of the compensation for their efforts in iraq
3616080 at what point does the west do something meaningful having the president backslapping with putin at the olympics is not a serious attempt to deal with the problem
3616081 the georgians who took us at our word when we talked about a partnership have got to be wondering what bush is all about
3616082 the last thing russia wants is a war with the west if they came eye to eye with nato warplanes they would retreat
3616083 i would have rather the russians hadnt responded but saakashvili sure did it and he did it in the mistaken belief i believe that he had friends in the bush administrations court
3616084 we have consistently and on thursday also urged the georgians not to move their forces in we were unambiguous about it
3616085 saakashvili had always told us he could not stand by while georgian villages were being shelled and we always knew this was a point of pressure we always told him that he should not give in to the kind of provocations we knew the russians were capable of
3616086 i think the state department was assiduous in urging restraint and saakashvilis buddies in the white house and office of the vice president kept egging him on
3616087 that allowed him to misinterpret the degree and depth of our support
3616088 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3616089 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3616090 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3616091 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3616092 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3616093 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3616094 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3616095 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3616096 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3616097 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3616098 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3616099 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3616100 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3616101 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3616102 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3616103 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3616104 until now this information has remained highly guarded over the past 18 months as biosolar established academic and industry credibility
3616105 now that our technology is strongly protected both domestically and abroad we are able to share this exciting news with the public
3616106 we have demonstrated that functional photovoltaic backsheets can be produced from renewable resources
3616107 we believe that the biobacksheet is a viable alternative to backsheets currently in use not only is this product produced from sustainable and renewable resources but is expected to be more cost effective than the current backsheets
3616108 also manufacturers currently enduring a six month wait for materials like duponts petroleum based tedlar protective material will undoubtedly be interested in this development
3616109 as a publicly traded company we have a responsibility to our shareholders to maximize the value of their investment with this presentation dr levy has laid out the exciting results of the past hard work this tremendous success and the positive feedback from those manufacturers who have been testing our product samples are guiding our drive to full production capacity
3616110 we are very fortunate to have mr nakamura continue his leadership of the applied optics group with our expanding focus on solar simulation
3616111 mr nakamura has made tremendous contributions throughout his long history with this company and eye will continue its investments in areas targeted at reducing our carbon footprint
3616112 mr nakamura possesses a global knowledge of lighting technologies and solar applications with the addition of mr brown and his broad background in systems and application engineering i am confident this team understands the needs of solar simulation customers and can apply our wealth of lighting technology to develop best in class systems to advance sustainable energy solutions in na
3616113 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
3616114 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
3616115 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet
3616116 how do i mention speculating without creating at the very least some wild speculation over the coming months am i considering something with the boys of janes addiction yes

3616134 the law has definitely been due for an update and these recommendations go a long way to improve the act and bringing it into a more modern framework
3616135 where i do think the commission has missed the boat is with areas where it couldve taken the next logical step
3616136 its hesitated from doing that in particular because of its reluctance to deal with the impact of software as a service as realised in things like social networks where people and businesses share personal information
3616137 throwing more education at an issue doesnt really deal with the issue from a regulatory perspective
3616138 i think they shied away from that area maybe because they didnt see a way of solving it
3616139 its very early days for most of this technology and its use and application in society and business its good to be careful about but i also think its a little weak to just say we need education about this and make young people behave how we want them to
3616140 i dont think thats really grappling with the changes that are going on
3616141 im anticipating that over the next five to ten years a lot of what we currently do through email and instant messaging will become embedded more in social network type of interaction where our email is being conducted through that online identities
3616142 so i think the commission has missed an opportunity to make a big step forward and say
3616143 encourages the design of products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances green chemistry seeks to reduce and prevent pollution at its source
3616144 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3616145 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3616146 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3616147 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3616148 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will
3616149 expect to see a turnaround in the next quarter or two

3616166 it may have been small in military terms but it was of vast importance you have to be there and have a presence on the ground if youre serious about it
3616167 we appreciated the importance of the situation faster than most other news outlets and adrian blomfield our moscow correspondent was in georgia on the ground and filing quicker than anyone else
3616168 it lifted our coverage above the others and was noticed by some very important news aggregator websites telegraph co uk has had a record few days for traffic

3616174 i very much believe that the financial markets will continue to put pressure on earnings for the next six months but i also believe very firmly that if we continue to concentrate on the basics we will continue to create a lot of shareholder value for the long term
3616175 the results achieved in the first six months are a reflection of the strength of our activities and the strategic value of our balanced spread of revenue and profit by constantly focusing on strengthening our market position the group has achieved an increase of 6 both in revenue and net profit in spite of deteriorating macro economic conditions and a negative currency impact and an organic revenue growth of approximately 3 at constant exchange rates compared with our strong performance in the first half of 2007 in the first six months of 2008 we continued our strategy of profitable growth through organic developments and acquisitions on the one hand investments occurred to increase efficiency and to accommodate the growing demand for products systems and processes on the other hand a number of acquisitions were finalised to strengthen our market position expand our portfolio of systems and technologies and extend our geographical presence
3616176 de resultaten over de eerste zes maanden bevestigen de kracht van onze activiteiten en de strategische waarde van onze evenwichtige verdeling van omzet en resultaat door de continue focus op versterking van onze marktpositie heeft de groep ondanks de verslechterde macro economische omstandigheden en een negatief valuta effect ten opzichte van een sterk eerste halfjaar 2007 een stijging van de netto omzet n het nettoresultaat van 6 gerealiseerd en een autonome omzetgroei van circa 3 tegen constante wisselkoersen wij hebben in de eerste helft van 2008 onze strategie om door middel van autonome groei en acquisities winstgevend te groeien verder gecontinueerd enerzijds zijn investeringen gepleegd om zowel de efficiency te vergroten als aan de toenemende vraag naar de producten systemen en processen te kunnen voldoen anderzijds is een aantal acquisities afgerond ter versterking van de marktpositie verbreding van de portfolio aan systemen en technologie n en uitbreiding van de geografische aanwezigheid

3616210 during the first half of the year companys turnover has increased faster as expected the increase in turnover is influenced by good existing project backlog and successes both in device and software sales the profit development in proportion with the turnover growth for the first year half didnt reach the long term target mainly because of the structure of the turnover was emphasized by the device and partner software sales and the growth of the staff expenses this growth couldnt yet be completely transferred to customer prices during the second quarter of the year the company achieved to improve profitability clearly compared to the first quarter of 2008 after the first half of the year we can more definitely believe in the fulfillment of the objectives related to growth of turnover and profitability that are set for the whole year 2008 this means organic growth of over 10 percent and the improvement of last years operating profit of nearly 5 percent in addition to the profitable domestic activities the growth potential in russian markets seems to strengthen during the last part of the year well increase our efforts in russia in the growth phase of business operations the adequate availability of proper employees will became one of the most crucial success factors as well in the domestic front as in russia we have already recruited exceptionally considerable number of new employees to strengthen our know how

3616225 het is een serieuze bedreiging erger dan eerder gevonden dns zwakheden met de huidige patchronde is het trouwens nog niet geheel aangepakt er zullen meer acties nodig zijn dit wordt dus nog vervolgd nog niet alle netwerkbeheerders en beveiligers nemen dit serieus dat komt waarschijnlijk omdat het best om complexe materie gaat die niet iedereen zomaar doorziet
3616226 dns heeft een grondslag in vrijwel elke dienst op het internet risicos in dns zijn daardoor in feite dus risicos op alle lagen
3616227 er is allerlei software in omloop die dns bibliotheken gebruiken en die niet gepatched gaat worden omdat er geen patch voor is of omdat niet eens bekend is dat die software dns gebruikt proxies en embedded systemen bijvoorbeeld dus het credo patch nu is tegelijktijd zinvol en zinloos
3616228 dns heeft een grondslag in vrijwel elke dienst op het internet risicos in dns zijn daardoor in feite dus risicos op alle lagen
3616229 het recente dns lek wordt door velen terecht gezien als de grootste cyber bedreiging van de laatste 10 jaar
3616230 het is belachelijk dat ietf niets wil doen aan het protocol een van de hoekstenen van internet is mank en dat moet worden opgelost
3616231 er is door de dns werkgroep van de ietf besloten om de voorgestelde lapmiddelen eerst goed te onderzoeken op hun complexiteit en effectiviteit er wordt dus wel degelijk iets gedaan binnen de ietf maar voordat grootschalige en wereldwijde oplossingen worden gerealiseerd wordt er eerst goed nagedacht
3616232 het is belachelijk dat ietf niets wil doen aan het protocol een van de hoekstenen van internet is mank en dat moet worden opgelost dat dat tijd en geld gaat kosten is een feit maar wat kost het wanneer hele tlds worden voorzien van valse dns gegevens niet alleen qua gemiste inkomsten voor bedrijven maar vooral voor particulieren die ervanuitgaan dat ze ook op de website zitten die ze willen hebben om hun bankrekening in te zien
3616233 het is niet gemakkelijk om secure dns snel uit te rollen maar als sidn en grote spelers als surfnet en isps zich hier sterk voor maken kan secure dns snel een feit zijn met als effect zwaan kleef aan
3616234 een structurele oplossing zou vanuit de softwareleveranciers moeten komen zolang deze leveranciers aan zowel de server als de client kant oude standaarden en versies blijven ondersteunen vaak als default ontstaat er nergens initiatief of berhaupt een mogelijkheid aangezien er incompatibiliteit ontstaat om dergelijke problemen op te lossen grote softwareleveranciers zouden de handen ineen moeten slaan om structurele verbeteringen in oude standaarden door te voeren in eerste instantie dns smtp alleen op die manier ontstaat er voldoende momentum om verandering te realiseren dit is geen beheer of security probleem het gevolg vervelend genoeg wel maar achterstallig onderhoud
3616235 ik zou willen voorstellen dat de internetknooppunten overal ter wereld richtlijnen opstellen waaraan aangesloten partijen moeten voldoen een veilig en actueel netwerk moet een voorwaarde worden om te mogen aansluiten als een bedrijf dat niet heeft kan het worden gesanctioneerd tot aan afsluiting toe als ultieme maatregel
3616236 internet is nooit bedoeld als een zwaar beveiligd netwerk maar als een net voor gegevensuitwisseling tussen mensen die weten wat ze doen echter we leven in het nu de wereld wordt er niet beter van als we alleen maar bezig zijn lekken of lekjes te dichten in systemen die al zo lang draaien de ietf heeft een verstandig besluit genomen
3616237 in 0 7 seconden of in 24 uur is een significant verschil het patchen van de servers is dus niet geheel voor niets geweest de manier waarop de patch is getest is wel discutabel en laat zien dat het delen van de informatie met een select gezelschap een slecht geteste patch tot leven heeft gebracht maar het is er wel een die ons de tijd geeft na te denken hoe het nu wel moet

3616278 i think it pitched in line and was hitting middle
3616279 yeah you are correct and the height seems to be okay
3616280 actually it pitched outside off and hit him in front of middle so there is an angle and there is a distance for the ball to cover so your basis for giving it out is wrong let me have a look

3616320 its one thing for the opposition to make their case with commercials persuading people to be against it prop 8 because they favor homosexual marriage and those kinds of things
3616321 but its another thing to be outright deceptive and this is the epitome of political deceptive practices that have no business in any campaign
3616322 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3616323 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3616324 i dont make the rules i only try to subvert them utilizing sophistic poorly reasoned rationalizations that satisfy my own warped world view
3616325 no you just have to ride like you never have to breathe again
3616326 it helps being positive nervous because youve been waiting four years for this
3616327 i was enjoying going fast it was pretty fun i just kept saying faster faster
3616328 i raced as well as i could i cannot affect what others do
3616329 theres no secret you just have to make it hurt imagine a friend sitting on your wheel shouting at you
3616330 its the ride of my life its what ive dreamed about since i was a little kid
3616331 i had to stay focused on the descent and really push
3616332 i have really enjoyed this summer the ball has been coming out beautifully the speeds have stayed reasonably high and i have been taking wickets pretty consistently
3616333 milestones are lovely when they come along but my main target is to keep my place in the team
3616334 if i am taking wickets then they cannot leave me out that is how i have looked at it
3616335 but i now know im a good bowler who can perform at this level i have just been telling myself how good i am
3616336 i can think of a couple of times i have struggled a little bit during the first innings against new zealand at old trafford
3616337 apart from that i cant think of any time that i have felt like i have not bowled well or been in the game
3616338 its mainly down to me im the only guy that can keep drilling it into myself
3616339 it has also given me confidence that i have maintained my fitness which has helped keep my speeds up
3616340 four tests in five weeks is a good physical challenge and i came through that
3616341 the nice thing about seeing fred bat at six is that it gives us balance and lets us put out the attack we put out in the last test
3616342 watching the bowling attack with the four seamers it gave us lots of options to maintain pressure for longer and thats really promising
3616343 fred looks in good nick to me hes played well at six before so theres no reason at all why he cant play well at six again
3616344 when were looking at the side for india which may have two spinners we need to get the balance right between getting runs and taking wickets
3616345 on this showing at the oval it allows you to pressure the batters for longer which had quite a big influence on the game
3616346 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
3616347 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3616348 the results of those meetings will then be fed back to me and also to the icc vice president sharad pawar and icc chief executive haroon lorgat on 20 august so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3616349 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3616350 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us the opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3616351 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during the asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and thus improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event
3616352 we didnt bowl nearly as well as we had expected on this tour
3616353 but the fact that we won the series and were 2 0 up after edgbaston is heartening for us because we know we have this huge ability to improve and yet we are still winning
3616354 the loss of dale steyn after the second test was tough
3616355 he has been a huge performer for us during the year so it will be nice to see him hopefully performing well in the one dayers
3616356 it just makes us think a little more about what we need to do to beat australia
3616357 its about getting all things working in the same direction and getting the confidence up
3616358 i think they need him desperately in one day cricket
3616359 especially in the last couple of overs of the powerplays and then going through the middle period where guys are getting ones and twos if they get in they generally play it how they want it but hes the guy who can let you still attack as a captain
3616360 it would give you a totally different option to a lot of sides they dont have that
3616361 i think hes got a lot to offer in the one day set up but im not sure what his feelings are on that
3616362 i think the way they are thinking is that now is a perfect opportunity to keep him going for the rest of durhams championship campaign
3616363 he is not going to be bowling every day you dont want to overdo it but in general hes been under bowled
3616364 i think he does realise that and wants to keep on top of it wants to make sure hes in good form when he gets out and plays
3616365 i cant get the ball out of his hands which is amazing often the plan is to give him three or four overs nothing happens but he gets two wickets in his 13th which is just amazing credit to him
3616366 a lot of guys have maybe questioned his heart or whatever when the teams needed him and hes either been a bit off the boil or just maybe a lack of confidence at times
3616367 but when it comes to major situations against really good players he wants to be involved
3616368 decades in the future a 70 tony stark is overseeing his ultimate project of his lauded career the completion of earths first commercial space elevator whose inauguration will change the worlds economy and the future of space exploration forever however not everyone is looking forward to this projects launch with the same enthusiasm as the head of stark universal sinister forces are at work behind the scenes to insure that starks pinnacle scientific achievement ends in disaster

3616373 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3616374 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3616375 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3616376 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3616377 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3616378 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3616379 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3616380 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3616381 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3616382 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3616383 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3616384 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3616385 we knew it was going to be close and we have to wait for all the votes to be counted
3616386 i wish wed have had more turnout that wouldve made a bigger difference in the margin here
3616387 hes mr reno ive seen him underestimated many times hes a wily guy
3616388 i didnt want to get into negative stuff and that is how im going to conduct the campaign as i go forward
3616389 i can ask the questions dan should have been asking at council
3616390 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3616391 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3616392 theres not a unified position between the manufacturers and you cant even call it a factory position unless youre talking about harley these are distributors they represent the brand theres always a certain level of conflict between the u s distributors and the factories in japan each entity factory and u s distributor kind of thinks theyre the center of the universe
3616393 the whole r amp d process is so complex that when american distributors say weve gotta do this for product development that is such a load some of the data flows back but as part of a formal process no way its all about racing to market and sell bikes literbikes
3616394 whats behind this discord is that the manufacturers have lost control and theyve lost control to a company thats got a whole lot of money and knows how to run a racing series i wonder if theyre trying to screw up roger edmondson s efforts so much that they can come back in and run things the way they want the manufacturers have developed the literbikes for a retail market if you know you have to have racing success to sell those bikes and now someone comes in and isnt as interested in racing them because of the tracks well youre going to have problems
3616395 when the manufacturers decided to climb that mountain and race those bikes it was because thats where the american market was going even though they knew that the tracks in the u s were not up to the standards of the european tracks they knew that the bikes would be problems on u s tracks
3616396 so youve got companies where the u s arm has been pushing for a literbike that works on u s tracks and then dmg comes in and says its not as interested in literbikes and the u s arm starts to go uh oh the u s people personally are heavily invested as far as their integrity their credibility their relationship with japan in the literbikes
3616397 i think theyd have a hard time selling that to the public
3616398 look at valentino rossi he can win on anything look at ricky carmichael hes had a successful career with three different manufacturers thats how entertainment is tied to sports marketing those guys are a brand onto themselves and they help the manufacturers reach audiences if the manufacturers can accept a position as important but not dominant when it comes to marketing it can benefit them

3616467 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3616468 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3616469 the uniforms are on their way kill them first then come and kill me
3616470 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3616471 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3616472 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3616473 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3616474 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3616475 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3616476 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3616477 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3616478 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3616479 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3616480 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3616481 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3616482 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3616483 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3616484 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3616485 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3616486 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3616487 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3616488 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3616489 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3616490 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3616491 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
3616492 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
3616493 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3616494 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3616495 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3616496 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3616497 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3616498 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3616499 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3616500 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3616501 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3616502 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

3616510 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3616511 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3616512 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3616513 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3616514 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3616515 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3616516 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off

3616542 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3616543 malheureusement dans le nettoyage ethnique que pratique la junte militaire birmane dans lest du pays le viol est utilis comme un instrument de guerre de m me quau darfour

3616546 une femme de 35 ans avait t viol e par plusieurs janjawid membres des milices arabes au soudan et quand elle a revu son mari il savait d j quelle avait t viol e et il a divorc sur le champ la laissant avec huit enfants
3616547 evidemment si vous faites cela avec suffisamment de communaut s vous d truisez les familles vous d truisez le tissu communautaire et si vous le faites dans suffisamment de villages vous pouvez d truire le tissu dun groupe ethnique et cest ce qui est fait au darfour et ce qui a t fait dans lest de la birmanie

3616587 since we left japan it has been circled on my calendar
3616588 we get a chance to redeem ourselves everybody is excited everybody cant wait this is going to be our first test
3616589 its getting on two years now and we havent forgotten we are really looking forward to playing them
3616590 yeah we want to get them back the team that loses never forgets ever
3616591 they beat us its a bad feeling were looking to come out and get our revenge
3616592 basketball is such a global sport you really dont have to have nba players
3616593 were looking forward to it its a great opportunity to see how much weve improved since we last played them
3616594 its going to be exciting its the team that beat us in 2006 so we are looking forward to the challenge
3616595 its the only play they ran and they ran it to perfection so we dont expect them to do anything different come thursday
3616596 we were really young and i think a lot of us have grown and matured since then weve gotten a lot stronger
3616597 we have to stay focused stay calm and keep our heads they are going to be very emotional and we just need to play through that theyve been playing together for a long time and they know how to play the game
3616598 i wouldnt say we overlooked them we didnt know much about them
3616599 we didnt know what to expect by the time we realized we had to make some adjustments the game was over and we lost the game
3616600 now we have been working on it for the last two years i think we are much improved in defending the pick and roll now i think that greece game two years ago opened up our eyes and showed us some things that we had to work on
3616601 it will be a venue for creative and innovative ways to encourage truth telling and to search for truth
3616602 an unprecedented performance activity in defiance of the rule of the untruth of society
3616603 nine days from now filipino artists will converge in one place in manila in our pursuit of truth we learn to order our priorities and in the process learn to transform our lives
3616604 because artists are also citizens today we wish to announce a major undertaking of filipino artists as citizens
3616605 the artists are doing it hand in hand with all the sectors of our society
3616606 artists play a fundamental and continuing role in making our nation we have time and again taken up the responsibility to use the arts in crystallizing issues and principles and reinforcing our peoples commitment towards a collective endeavor especially during times of crisis
3616607 celebration and not a protest the program will mainly be song presentations cultural performances and a creative expression of the whole community
3616608 now peter sat outside in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech betrayeth thee then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly
3616609 if i am killed or thrown into prison how can i help the master
3616610 though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee
3616611 let all the house of israel assuredly know that god hath made that same jesus both lord and christ
3616612 they profess that they know god but in works they deny him
3616613 but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel
3616614 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof
3616615 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them
3616616 for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness lustfulness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ i will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the lord having saved rescued the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not
3616617 this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me
3616618 whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven
3616619 the irony is that the subject of their veneration is a thorn in the side of the open source community

3616623 the downside to any tweaking however is that pushing components beyond their rated limits can make a system unstable but ruiz out meyer in at amd
3616624 hector ruiz is out as chief executive at advanced micro devices nyse amd as the struggling chip maker on thursday reported its seventh 14 classic tech rivalries
3616625 demand remained thin but the price could stay around 700 for around a month as the government intervention scheme is still in place
3616626 our sales dropped to around 500 tons per lot compared to 5 000 10 000 tons in previous months
3616627 there were no lapses in an armed conflict unfortunately there will be casualties one of our soldiers was fatally hit in the head i dont think it is a matter of finger pointing
3616628 our helicopters were available but the weather didnt allow it
3616629 when it comes to the olympic games the counters go back to zero
3616630 a lot of people have been settling for second best instead of trying to beat him hoy but everyone has weak points and im going to try and find them
3616631 the team is still going quick and we are training around world record pace
3616632 theyre beatable but you must pull out one hell of a miracle to do it
3616633 victory its not a good mentality if you consider you are going to lose
3616634 we have said that it will be coming out this year i can tell you its not coming in the july to september quarter
3616635 but thats just going to put a little more added pressure on doing things right our strong belief is there will be guys who really step up during this time period
3616636 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3616637 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3616638 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3616639 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3616640 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will

3616647 i t is true that the prosecution has charged the five people with genocide
3616648 if the co investigating judges think there are genocide cases charges must be imposed
3616649 it seems correct to suggest that in killing their fellow cambodians members of the dk democratic kampuchea regime were acting against those whom they saw as enemies of the state
3616650 the cham nation no longer exists on kampuchean soil belonging to the khmer
3616651 t he cham nationality language customs and religious beliefs must be immediately abolished
3616652 the timing seems odd to me and i cant see how former s 21 chief kaing guek eav duch or former kr foreign minister ieng sary can be convicted of genocide under the phrasing of the un convention against genocide
3616653 perhaps the defendants will be judged innocent of genocide which in my opinion they are in the absence of evidence proving genocidal intent
3616654 we will continue being shoulder to shoulder with the srp to protest against the election results we will also join with srp to protest in europe and at the un
3616655 the election process in cambodia was conducted in line with the election law of cambodia any complaint or unacceptable problem must be addressed under cambodian law
3616656 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3616657 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth
3616658 finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3616659 our striking result is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust
3616660 patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3616661 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through
3616662 i fast during ramadan myself and know that special measures need to be taken for the spectators for matches played during that month
3616663 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3616664 declaring the du north campus a tobacco free zone is one of my biggest achievements last month we invited the health minister to our campus and he was very impressed with the whole scenario and supported our campaign whole heartedly
3616665 im sure a lot of belgians feel it is unfair the champions of a country have to play a qualifying round to get into the champions league
3616666 it is going to be a very difficult two matches to qualify for the next stage of the champions league
3616667 people here in belgium were probably hoping for a more favourable draw but we are still relishing the opportunity to play against liverpool
3616668 we definitely respect liverpool they are a great and huge club they have a great history especially in terms of the champions league so we will have our work cut out for us
3616669 hopefully we will be able to rise to the occasion in the two matches that lay ahead there is always belief
3616670 im sure that the people of liverpool are probably happy with the draw and hopefully we can use that to our advantage
3616671 you never know in football we have a lot of good players here
3616672 obviously the belgian league is not as respected as the premier league but i feel that we have quality players that can possibly make a difference on any given day
3616673 any win against liverpool is going to be a big win but for me it was so because it was my first start at home and first win with them
3616674 it will always stay a big souvenir for me in terms of my newcastle experience but that is in the past and i tend not to dwell on the past too much and try to concentrate on the future
3616675 a lot has changed at liverpool a lot of different players have come into that team
3616676 fernando torres is a great player and i had the opportunity to play against him this summer when the us played against spain
3616677 it was 1 0 to spain torres played the first half and at the end of that it was 0 0
3616678 personally i think i defended pretty well against him although he was also coming off an injury so he probably wasnt at 100
3616679 he has a lot of different tricks in his arsenal and you have to be on your toes at all times and concentrate
3616680 but there is not just one player that we have to be aware of it is the whole squad
3616681 ive always said that my ambitions are to leave belgium for a bigger league if that be england then that would be great
3616682 ive matured a lot and progressed in a lot of different factors and aspects of my game since 2007
3616683 i feel as though i had a short stint in order to adapt to the style of the premier league
3616684 sometimes it takes players six to eight months to get used to the premier league style
3616685 unless you keep goats or chickens which fewer people do you had to buy your fertilisers and manure from a nursery making it less affordable

3616869 foster the interest of its members and to aid one another under any circumstances
3616870 to the detriment of the legitimate interest of those who are not members
3616871 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
3616872 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
3616873 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
3616874 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
3616875 im happy going deep into the game but im not happy with putting our guys in a hole
3616876 i was going to look for the cutter and pull the ball
3616877 he missed his spot and i was able to connect
3616878 not only do we not know what the fuck hes talking about
3616879 alberto es un ciclista que puede hacerlo todo y todo bien si tiene un buen d a tiene muchas posibilidades de ganar porque el circuito le va bien
3616880 no es un recorrido para especialistas sino para hombres fuertes mi nica duda es saber si no le faltar un poco de forma por no haber corrido el tour pero creo que est en perfectas condiciones
3616881 via i posteggiatori abusivi dalle nostre strade la petizione di palermo blogolandia it brucio dal desiderio
3616882 this grace which god freely gives to the vessels of mercy begins with illuminating the heart it does not find mans will good but makes it so it chooses first in order that it may be chosen nor is it received unless it first work in the heart of man therefore both the reception of grace and the desire for it are the work of grace itself
3616883 military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended
3616884 one of the most important lessons of the wars in iraq and afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win
3616885 it simply does not have the built in domestic constituency of defense programs
3616886 as an example the f 22 aircraft is produced by companies in 44 states thats 88 senators
3616887 military force usually has the opposite effect from what is intended
3616888 we need to believe in the power of american diplomacy and we should not believe a military conflict with iran is inevitable
3616889 our first impulse should be a serious and patient and persistent diplomatic effort too often in our national debate we focus on the military option and give short shrift to the diplomatic option
3616890 we pattern last years tax returns and have a look at where the pattern of claims are starting to shift in a way that looks out of kilter
3616891 we are seeing the claims around self education for nurses on the rise also what they are claiming as self education
3616892 home office expenses computers laptops pdas these kind of things werent on the radar 10 years ago
3616893 where we do write to people the average reduction in the claim in the next year is 15 per cent so we are not bad at getting the targeting right ms granger said
3616894 we are closing the loop if you like between wealthy individuals and the entities they control
3616895 we are looking to approach that in a far more sophisticated and holistic manner
3616896 in particular the accc considered that competition in retail banking markets provided by the other major banks and regional banks along with credit unions building societies and niche players would be sufficient to constrain the merged firm after the acquisition
3616897 the accc acknowledges the role that regional banks have played in challenging the major banks particularly as they have entered new states and competed aggressively to gain market share
3616898 we are delighted with the results of this tender process which relates to itc managed plantations in the bunbury region we have achieved an excellent stumpage price for our growers and shareholders
3616899 this contract will assist greatly in reducing operating costs and allow the operation to reach its full potential
3616900 excessive equipment cross hire from third parties a particular concern
3616901 after the refinancing booms overall cost of debt is expected to average around nine per cent for the 2009 financial year which is noteworthy in the current interest rate climate
3616902 as at 30 june 2008 the companys debt equated to 255 million
3616903 a number of initiatives in this area have already been implemented and we are seeing early signs of progress
3616904 i am confident the results will be evident as early as the first quarter of financial year 2009

3616908 we dont have to worry about iraq turning into another vietnam because we have an exit strategy
3616909 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
3616910 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
3616911 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3616912 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
3616913 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3616914 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3616915 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3616916 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3616917 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile
3616918 not exactly the greatest hand of cards to have to play
3616919 all this basically means that russia emerges as a great power
3616920 not a global power like it used to be but a power that has to be taken very seriously
3616921 georgia in a way is suffering for all that happened to russia in the last 20 years
3616922 washington and the administration are playing an extremely dirty game
3616923 they will show putin as an occupier even if putin is doing nothing
3616924 he is playing the game which is designed by putin
3616925 now he can cruise the volga for all the remaining years or can go right to the bahamas
3616926 i must admit that for the first time in my life i felt admiration for the skill with which vladimir putin maintains his power
3616927 i would say you have a situation in which the russians have come to the red line
3616928 if we catch them in the toilet well rub them out in the outhouse
3616929 i will recommend to conduct the operation so that nothing on you will grow again
3616930 he has such a visceral attitude toward saakashvili that that seems to drown out anything else that anyone says to him

3616970 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3616971 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3616972 ever since i was alittle boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3616973 all i could think about was getting the tumor out of his head
3616974 it just really didnt seem like his time to go
3616975 i spent three days imagining he was being tortured to death

3616984 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3616985 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3616986 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3616987 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3616988 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3616989 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3616990 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3616991 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3616992 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3616993 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3616994 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3616995 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3616996 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3616997 halo 3 just as halo 2 did before it presents a roadmap for the way online will be integrated into videogames in the coming years the game has been incredibly successful and attracted millions of fans but we shouldnt overlook all of the ideas that are present in the game and the remarkably robust manner in which they are presented bungie deserved to be credited for their achievements as they will help shape the future of online games
3616998 because i was close to a medal but i am so happy i really am
3616999 because i am a pretty calm person i think that is what has helped me deal with the ups and downs of it all the way through to get focused again between runs especially between the semi final and that last run
3617000 this whole olympics has been a rollercoaster ups and downs
3617001 just making it through the semis and then having to wait for the protest from the american yesterday just scraping into the final again after there was a protest there as well
3617002 when i finished my last run the only part that i wasnt happy with was the last up stream on the right hand side
3617003 i dont know how long maybe a second a second and a half but apart from that i was delighted with the run and then yeah because it was an olympic event people started to try to go too hard after me so to go from the run that i did in the first run to cut it back i was ecstatic then as people started to go down i was getting more and more happy then as it got closer i was thinking maybe maybe
3617004 because i was close to a medal but i am so happy i really am
3617005 winning is a great feeling but this under the circumstances and the pressure involved this is my best result
3617006 i dont think this will make much of a difference to the amount of slalom canoeists unless we get a facility look at this facility it is a huge white water and this is where all of our races were on and we are training on flat water on the liffey
3617007 if we dont get a facility the sport wont grow and we wont have the depth they dont have to be on this grand scale they can be built for 3 million which is not a lot and they can be made into a commercial business with rafting and tourism
3617008 sponsorship is difficult too in ireland because we dont have the facility it is a minority sport
3617009 but look i am not in it for the money if i was in it for the money i would pick a different sport
3617010 i am just relieved we got through without having to pay anything the whole thing started in november and it has been a rollercoaster of emotions
3617011 all of a sudden we had to find 10 000 it would have been a lot to pay and could have sent us under it was suggested we should fold the business rather than pay the money but i didnt want to do that because it has taken me so long to set up the business the way it is
3617012 if it hadnt been for our solicitor it could have been a far worse situation

3617014 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3617015 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3617016 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3617017 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3617018 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3617019 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3617020 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3617021 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
3617022 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the
3617023 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3617024 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out

3617069 a lot of people were angry or upset that i left houston but it really wasnt a commitment to the people in the community

3617097 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3617098 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
3617099 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3617100 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3617101 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3617102 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3617103 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3617104 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3617105 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3617106 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3617107 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3617108 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3617109 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3617110 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3617111 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3617112 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3617113 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3617114 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3617115 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3617116 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3617117 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3617118 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3617119 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3617120 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3617121 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3617122 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3617123 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3617124 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3617125 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3617126 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3617127 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3617128 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3617129 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3617130 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3617131 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3617132 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3617133 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3617134 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3617135 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3617136 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3617137 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3617138 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3617139 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3617140 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3617141 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3617142 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3617143 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3617144 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
3617145 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
3617146 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
3617147 zanu pf is not talking about conceding any real power they are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control these guys arent serious
3617148 the differences revolve around who will have power theyre not giving up anything on that they entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues
3617149 there is a lot of pressure on tsvangirai people in the party are telling him that he cannot agree to a deal that does not recognise the peoples will and democracy mugabe should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him
3617150 the pressure for us is coming from the people they dont want to see some kind of half hearted change if we were to do that we would lose credibility if morgan takes something cosmetic from zanu pf he will lose the support of the zimbabwean people
3617151 my message is that i give all my strength here im fighting for you as you are fighting there
3617152 important to show georgia in a good light right now
3617153 they the media wants us to fight together it would be good to have peace between georgia and russia but for me here and now it doesnt matter
3617154 theyre not from georgia theyre brazilian it doesnt matter whom we play we just play
3617155 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3617156 sheikh azizs death is big loss to kashmir nation we will take his mission to its logical end
3617157 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3617158 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3617159 i spend 1 000 riyals every a day on qat and i earn about 4 000
3617160 im sad that its there but i enjoy the culture
3617161 we have chews where we listen to music or talk politics but i dont want my staff to chew i dont want them to waste their money especially if they dont have very much
3617162 the decision not to use qat is not equivalent to the decision to decline drinks at a dinner party
3617163 it is much more important because it excludes the person from social contacts that are necessary for his business or private life
3617164 its got to the stage where foreign donors say the government needs to choose between qat and food
3617165 in my day job i wear pin striped suits so wearing a racing cheerleader costume was a lot of fun
3617166 i dont ride bikes at home but ive heard the vibrations can make a girl really happy
3617167 id really like to buy him a nintendo whatever it costs
3617168 how many people are left in the world that would do that
3617169 i will not announce a success before the ink is dry but the information we are getting makes the acceptance of my governments demands by the us more probable than only a few weeks ago
3617170 if we have to scratch and run the bases were going to do it if we have to hit some pitches and drive them out of the batters box thats what well do
3617171 what i remember was how he treated me in my first at bat
3617172 he got me out with a cut fastball instead of making something happen i said im going to look for the cutter and try to pull the ball and try to get some lift on the ball
3617173 even though it wasnt as far in as the one he got me out on it was a pitch he wanted to throw more in but he missed i was able to connect
3617174 i threw him some good changeups the first at bat he must have been looking for that changeup
3617175 everything was working i just had that one bad inning and one bad pitch really
3617176 i think its all due to my legs my strength is back ive been taking care of my knee doing my exercises and getting the treatment that i need its taken a long time but im glad its to the point where i feel very strong with my back leg
3617177 im always upset at myself when the other team scores first because percentage wise it doesnt work your way
3617178 lately it doesnt matter what were doing out there theyre showing up offensively theyre more relaxed it looks like theyre having a lot of fun and enjoying themselves things tend to go your way when that happens
3617179 his father lives in the future and 60 years from now michael is only an average swimmer so his father built a time machine and sent him back here to mop up
3617180 on the podium i kept tearing up thinking back at it im almost at a loss for words
3617181 theres nobody in any sport that wins like he wins
3617182 hes not just winning hes crunching world records and crunching the fields
3617183 im still a little tired after the other night i just need to get a good nights sleep and then try and get on the medal podium
3617184 my goggles pretty much filled up with water it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
3617185 it makes you wonder what he really could have done
3617186 shaun macdonald showed great quality with his finishing and he can only get better as hes still young and learning
3617187 he has all the attributes to be a great player at a high level
3617188 he needs to continue working hard and he will continue to get the rewards
3617189 we were beaten by a strong team but we can take heart out of our display
3617190 we defended well and never gave up i thought we created some problems in attack and on another night we could have scored
3617191 losing marcus bean was the most disappointing aspect of the night we have eight players injured and one suspended so its not a clever situation with 21 players to choose from
3617192 remote shopping while entirely feasible will flop because women like to get out of the house like to handle the merchandise like to be able to change their minds
3617193 one thing people almost certainly will want is electronic information retrieval the contents of libraries and other forms of information or education will be stored in a computer and will be instantly obtainable at home by dialing a code
3617194 1 everything that s already in the world when you re born is just normal 2 anything that gets invented between then and before you turn thirty is incredibly exciting and creative and with any luck you can make a career out of it 3 anything that gets invented after you re thirty is against the natural order of things and the beginning of the end of civilisation as we know it until it s been around for about ten years when it gradually turns out to be alright really
3617195 on the other hand time believed in the internet one thing people almost certainly will want is electronic information retrieval the contents of libraries and other forms of information or education will be stored in a computer and will be instantly obtainable at home by dialing a code

3617207 that play goes into center field and i said you know what everybodys gotta get the message
3617208 so i made that change and hopefully it wont happen again
3617209 hes actually really making strides defensively but you know its a phrase you hear probably more in football than baseball you just cant take plays off every pitch you owe it to the pitcher you just cant take any plays off and thats a hard thing over 162 games
3617210 he threw two days in a row saturday and sunday had monday off today he stretched it out a bit in the bullpen he said he felt good hell throw again wednesday
3617211 it always feels good to get back to practice you want to be on the same page as everybody out there its never good to be on the sideline watching practice
3617212 i havent had to kick a lot obviously reggie is in a tempo and is midseason form and i need to get there
3617213 they werent going to let me out here unless i could do pretty much everything
3617214 the only thing right now is lifting heavy weights mike said stay away from that youre a punter and you dont need to be doing that anyway
3617215 ill probably get the same amount of carries im assuming
3617216 we got some guys up front thatll knock you out walter jones mike wahle sean locklear rob sims those guys are just beasts up there and steve vallos is doing a really good job stepping in so us as a backfield were just going to try to bring the attitude and play off those guys
3617217 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3617218 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3617219 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3617230 when you concede 15 goals in two matches its a tough battle to keep your morale up
3617231 we have to take in the good and work out the bad
3617232 we have played the two strongest teams in our pool so hopefully it should get easier now

3617234 i am very excited about this technique as i believe it improves the quality of a persons life while enabling them to keep their current lifestyle
3617235 we discuss your specific issues learn what your goals are and then decide on the best treatment for your individual case

3617237 invisalign is a perfect example of how modern technology can aid medicine in very practical ways it is a great leap forward and offers a great alternative to traditional methods
3617238 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3617239 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3617240 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3617241 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3617242 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3617243 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3617244 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3617245 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3617246 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3617247 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3617248 we took advantage of the brief market rally in april to reduce our equity exposure nonetheless equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline interest income in the banking business rose strongly despite competition for deposits risk costs increased but remained below over the cycle norms costs remained under control in mature markets while we continued to invest to support growth
3617249 all capital and leverage ratios are well within target the group has eur 3 9 billion of spare leverage capacity after the completion of ings eur 5 billion share buyback and the payment of last years final dividend in the second quarter in line with our policy to pay an interim dividend equal to half of the previous years total dividend our interim dividend has been set at eur 0 74 per share to be paid fully in cash
3617250 ing maintained its commercial growth in these challenging market circumstances the net new production of client balances was eur 29 6 billion in the quarter bringing the total to eur 1 482 billion growth was driven by a large increase in lending particularly at the wholesale bank in retail banking and ing direct we continued to grow savings despite strong competition for deposits sales of life insurance were up 8 8 excluding currency impacts as product innovation and expanded distribution helped compensate for lower demand for unit linked products
3617251 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009 we are executing our strategy in the context of this challenging environment by focussing on growing client balances while keeping a close eye on margins and expenses we continue to adapt our product range to meet our customers changing needs while investing to expand our distribution in growth markets in mature markets we are on track with the transformation projects at our retail banking businesses in the benelux and expense reductions at the dutch insurance business are now evident as markets remain volatile we will continue to manage our risk and capital with discipline while financial markets are expected to put pressure on results in the short term we are confident that ing will continue to create profitable growth for our shareholders over the long term through the breadth of our business and the strength of our franchise
3617252 the feasibility study confirms our belief that rasuhuilca provides an excellent opportunity for rapid mine development and will serve as an additional profit stream to augment revenues expected to commence at the end of the year from our quintana gold mine development in colombia whilst being a relatively small mine in size having a plant in this area offers cmr tremendous opportunities for additional deals and further mine development
3617253 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3617259 well see if we get up tomorrow and make something of it if we come out and play flat dont have any energy and lose the series then it really didnt do us any good
3617260 i made a mistake the ball caught too much of the plate

3617268 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3617269 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3617270 im quite confident they will resolve all their outstanding matters which would result in this inclusive government and in the second instance then acting together
3617271 i wouldnt know about it we are facilitating discussions among three parties
3617272 no deal has been signed by anyone dialogue is still continuing
3617273 we are not taking chances the police across assam have been put on high alert and we are bent on thwarting any subversive activity by the militants
3617274 the minister was not at home during the attack at our home in bishnupur district no one was injured

3617277 it was a really great battle with coventry and thats what the olympics are all about the challenge
3617278 i was trying not to watch the race before i didnt really want to see what time they went but you cant help but hearing obviously with the loud speaker
3617279 it was only just by a little bit and i was feeling pretty good in the warm up to so i thought id have a go and try and go a little bit faster and im really glad i did
3617280 it is another race and if you do it any differently to how you do it before youre probably not going to swim as well so you just shut out all the distractions and have fun
3617281 id love to play more tests for australia and that remains a big goal but theres a lot of work to do before i think about that
3617282 my immediate goal is to win the starting job for the force and hopefully play some really good consistent rugby next year
3617283 there is plenty of competition in the halfback position at the force with chris oyoung and justin turner but ill do my best to put my name up there during the pre season and take it from there
3617284 mugabe wanted tsvangirai as a ceremonial prime minister there was never any serious intent by mugabe to give up power
3617285 there is no future for these talks unless the facilitator mbeki is able to come forward with proposals that demonstrate a change in mugabes position
3617286 the pressure only went one way on tsvangirai and he had no proposals to break the logjam
3617287 its clear that the drop in petrol prices tax cuts and signals from the reserve bank that it may cut interest rates has restored some consumer confidence
3617288 the rba should still follow through with its expected decision to drop interest rate though consumer confidence is still at its lowest level since 1993
3617289 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3617290 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3617291 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school
3617292 dr sullivan will long be remembered in gloucester for the many individual families he helped over the past 10 years i wish him all the best in his retirement
3617293 the lesson here for washington is that any modern conflict will include a cyberwarfare component simply because its too inexpensive to be passed up
3617294 the best defensive strategy is always preparedness weve spent eight years completely ignoring that while the chinese and indian governments have been paying really close attention and investing many tens of billions of dollars
3617295 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3617296 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3617297 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3617298 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3617299 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3617300 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3617301 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3617302 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3617303 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3617304 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3617305 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks
3617306 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles

3617313 using good cropland to expand biofuels will probably exacerbate global warming
3617314 assigning the blame for rainforest deforestation and grassland conversion to agriculture solely on the renewable fuels industry ignores key factors that play a greater role
3617315 the other studies missed a key factor that everyone agrees should have been included the land use changes that actually are going to increase greenhouse gas emissions
3617316 we should be focusing on our use of biofuels from waste products
3617317 and you have to be careful how much you require use the right biofuels but dont require too much too fast right now were making almost exclusively the wrong biofuels

3617452 familiar tales made exotic by their settings and the unexpected twists arising from very different human experiences
3617453 it began with a conversation that stemmed from the 9 11 attacks there was this conversation in the arts world about why america was so amazed by the rest of the worlds impression of the united states the idea was not so much to try to change everybody elses viewpoint in the rest of the world which is what the government tries to do but instead to try to make everyone here in the united states more aware of whats outside our borders
3617454 well go out and support filmmakers and filmmaking communities around the world by giving them grants to produce their films
3617455 and afterward we will bring those films here into the united states and give them a platform by which we can have some better vision of the world as a whole look at ourselves as a group of people rather than as us and them or east versus west or american versus mexican that was the general idea
3617456 i think we effect more people by not having distribution and granting programs tied together because every year the granting program gives out 20 grants and then we acquire 10 films thats 30 films total if we gave out the grants and distributed them at the same time it would be less
3617457 i think a lot of it is because we dont have any restrictions on the money we give out to filmmakers thats not a criticism of any other funder and i wouldnt want anybody to read it that way but we put a lot of trust in the filmmaker to complete his or her film according to the vision that theyve specified we dont say that you have to use this person for your production we dont say you have to premiere your film here we dont really require them to do anything other than create a film so even though were not the biggest funder out there we have a significant impact because i think people respect what were trying to do

3617469 the data gave the impression that the economy has entered a recession and i think it is in one
3617470 there is still some possibility that gdp will return to positive territory in the july september quarter but the downturn trend is likely to continue
3617471 even though the economy contracted in april june it would be more accurate to think that it wont last long
3617472 we cant expect export growth to accelerate any time soon so the economy will remain in an adjustment phase for the rest of this year
3617473 but we can probably avoid a full fledged recession as in several straight quarters of gdp contraction we still expect the bank of japans next policy move to be a rate hike but it wont come for the rest of this year
3617474 though prices are soaring our salaries dont rise our nation as a whole is demoralized
3617475 we have some of the largest oil supplies in the world and the contribution of our congress to this whole thing has been to lock up 85 percent of our offshore ground to further production and its locked up most of alaska for the production this is just basically wrong the keys to this whole thing are in the hands of congress their the ones that control the ability to go get that we need to do it and we need to do it now
3617476 its important to note that both political parties take contributions from a lot of different industries and that includes the oil industry
3617477 for instance in my campaign there have been 10 000 contributions from various sources my heart belongs to idaho people no one is going to buy my vote no one is going to influence my vote because my heart belongs to the idaho people
3617478 i think at the time it was a legitimate judgment but we are living in a different time right now then we were when the wall came down

3617503 at ucla a public university located in one of the most heterogeneous regions in the world diversity is an indispensable element of academic excellence
3617504 this commitment requires efforts to attract to the campus members of historically under represented racial and ethnic groups however to create a rich academic experience and intellectual and cultural environment for everyone we extend our concern beyond representation to genuine participation our commitment to diversity entails devising strategies and programmes to realise its benefits fully in education research and service this commitment inevitably means an openness to change indeed to transformation

3617513 is the mere sight of a bunch of italian supercars sufficient to turn a once orderly california freeway into a maelstrom of destruction that was the sigalert report on a jackknifed suv trailer combo on i 5 in orange county yesterday however the video taken from the in car dash cam of one of the gumballers may prove otherwise

3617517 die weitgehende aufl sung der modellreserve war angemessen weil die methodischen bewertungsrisiken aus dem cdo portfolio nunmehr berschaubar sind

3617521 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3617522 the results of those meetings will be fed back to me and also to icc vice president sharad pawar and icc ceo lorgat on august 20 so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3617523 we are committed to a safe and secure champions trophy we believe these visits and the feedbacks will play a major role in achieving those ends
3617524 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3617525 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event visit to pakistan has allowed task team to deal in reality instead of theories or perceptions

3617537 he got us deep into the game but he wasnt as sharp as hed been
3617538 honestly i didnt think too much about that or look around or anything like that i was just focused on pitching
3617539 our thought was that we needed to get to him early
3617540 i didnt think so and then i saw it on the video and it looked like it was heading right down into the mitt

3617547 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3617548 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems

3617560 it is dangerous now to let people come on the ground
3617561 i think they should just look after the players welfare if the afl think they can get security around the player then that is the way they attack it
3617562 if they think no one on the ground well then that is another way to attack it but they will do what is in the best interests of the teams and the players

3617598 allowing students to assist in the creation of rubrics may be a good learning experience for them
3617599 if students do not help to create the different rubrics teachers will probably want to share those rubrics with students before they complete the task or project
3617600 allowing students to assist in the creation of rubrics may be a good learning experience for them

3617604 through such activities as rubric creation and use students can come to understand the full education cycle concept teaching mastery and assessment
3617605 rubrics can be produced quite easily and quickly once students are confident in creating them
3617606 the evaluator should share the rubric with the students and inform them of the specific skills that will be assessed
3617607 the main advantage of this type of assessment rubric is that the studnets take an increased role in their learning
3617608 trying to copy the culture at google will not work unless we understand the kind of people work with us and similar other dynamics related to them
3617609 it was a dream come true just to race here

3617612 the starters success will let you play a long time
3617613 keep playing well now and then get an opportunity to play into the late fall
3617614 any time your starters are pitching that well and getting outs quickly you have more time to hit
3617615 if they hit those balls in milwaukee theyre not coming back
3617616 there were some plays where the ballpark helped me cam did a great job out there running the ball down but im not pitching to the ballpark
3617617 he made his pitches but it was a tough game for us
3617618 we hit a lot of balls well that were outs he had luck on his side
3617619 that thing looked like it was shot out of a cannon
3617620 those are fun home runs to watch because it was smoked
3617621 anybody who has bought a property at one of these sites is being kept up to date but this is an issue between us and the buyer the reason is the downturn in the housing market

3617628 a biscuit in the states is essentially a scone crossed with shortbread usually with lard instead of butter before theyre cooked i swear you can see the dough quiver as the gluten and carbohydrates struggle to hold the fat together

3617631 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3617632 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3617633 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3617634 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3617635 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3617636 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3617637 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting

3617642 straight kids cannot turn our backs on the plague of violence and discrimination against gay and lesbian students
3617643 when we students arent safe we cant learn only when we stand together will we find a solution
3617644 the purpose of the gsa is to provide a safe supportive environment for students to talk about anti gay bias harassment and violence and to work together to promote tolerance understanding and acceptance of one another regardless of sexual orientation
3617645 striking differences in head size and shape increased bite strength and the development of new structures in the lizards digestive tracts were noted after only 36 years which is an extremely short time scale
3617646 these structures actually occur in less than 1 percent of all known species of scaled reptiles
3617647 our data shows that evolution of novel structures can occur on extremely short time scales cecal valve evolution probably went hand in hand with a novel association between the lizards on pod mrcaru and microorganisms called nematodes that break down cellulose which were found in their hindguts
3617648 the scientists discovered that these non indigenous lizards had undergone remarkable evolutionary changes in only 36 years as they adapted to the new habitat
3617649 does this mean i have evolved into a new species over the last 53 years
3617650 dna analysis identified the lizards as identical to the species of the five adult pairs that were originally released on the island
3617651 identical is that the parent population has a certain genetic make up for a few sequences which have been examined the island population showes no changes in these particular sequences if one were to compare other sequences related to the morphological changes seen differences might be found
3617652 if he is offended by that then he should choose to ignore it

3617689 i dont think there is a lot of upside because now the market capitalisation of the entire market is about rs 50 lakh crore it is much closer to a fair valuation if oil were to go significantly down to about 70 80 per barrel then we will have a huge rally if oil is headed for 80 per barrel we may see the sensex at 17 000 18 000 mark

3617706 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
3617707 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
3617708 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
3617709 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
3617710 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day

3617717 so what makes you think you would be bored in your retirement youll just get to do exactly what you want to do right now only youll have more time to actually do it
3617718 well i guess its not boredom im really afraid of its laziness
3617719 the market and the financing conditions for condominiums have really taken a drastic turn
3617720 the vast majority of modas buyers decided not to proceed with the purchase of their unit
3617721 because the vast majority have bailed out on us we have no choice now but to turn it into a rental
3617722 to find a developer whos able to put an attractive product on the market that hits that lower price range is fantastic
3617723 i guess when the market turns well have to evaluate it at that time

3617729 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3617730 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3617731 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3617732 its something i have dreamed about for a long time
3617733 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort

3617741 i wanted the world record i wanted a 1 51 or better but given the circumstances its not too bad i guess

3617744 we were made aware of the situation when we got a report from the city government yesterday
3617745 our first priority is to keep the oil slick away from the venue and if necessary we will send out an oil boom if it approaches the competition area
3617746 dont get smart you two are in a heap of trouble

3617756 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3617757 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3617758 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3617759 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3617760 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3617761 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3617762 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3617763 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3617764 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3617765 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3617766 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3617767 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3617793 following a lengthy shift by the ticket office staff on monday night all season ticket holder details have now been inputted on to the system and other issues resolved allowing sales to begin for the weekend game
3617794 with this being the first game that has been sold in its entirety we would ask for patience as the staff process those fans waiting for their tickets
3617795 at mondays game the sole purpose was to test operational systems of the stadium and its immediate surrounds
3617796 various members of the safety advisory group were in attendance at the game and following a debriefing at the stadium on wednesday all authorities felt that they were of the opinion we should be granted a full safety certificate starting from our first league game of the season
3617797 i am obviously delighted with this result bearing in mind the short space of time we have had to get up and running and have right systems in place suffolk homes
3617798 this sounds daft to me the mistake was allowing patients records onto a laptop that was allowed off nhs premises
3617799 using numbers depersonalises patients and the last thing the patients actually want is to be referred to as a number
3617800 it is tempting fate as sooner or later there will be a mix up as names mean far more than numbers to staff
3617801 it feels as if you are losing your identity and at the end of the day when i ring the hospital i like to think i will be called by my name
3617802 they are frightened now because of the loss of the laptop but that was one person and i do not see why the whole of the staff should be penalised
3617803 they just need to be careful and use common sense when using patients names in correspondence but a number i dont want to be just a number
3617804 the letter to staff is a reminder of procedures to ensure that patient information is managed in the correct way
3617805 it forms one of the trusts continuing steps to ensure patient confidentiality and security of data
3617806 the colchester hospital generic e mail account is unsecured so it is fine for day to day communication between staff but personal details that could identify a patient should not be sent via this route suffolk homes

3617814 we think even with conventional matters we can do another big step in fuel consumption
3617815 we are working on the new car the next car is in the pipeline
3617816 but the engine will remain similar to today of course we will do some additional features to improve the consumption further
3617817 i think it is a back up scenario for us to discuss but it is not a mainstream
3617818 smaller capacity engines and turbocharging are something else this engine will be more expensive and have more problems in packaging and change our position because then you have more turbos in the 911 range
3617819 we have some possibilities like the weight of the car is important for us in the future we are thinking that sheer power is not the right way
3617820 with porsche it is always trying to make a clever mix of all materials not only aluminium look at the audi r8 it weights as much as a 911 turbo despite 60 horsepower less and only being a two seater and a smaller engine and so on

3617839 our immediate focus is to get this car developed and get it in the market in the united states
3617840 it would be something that would be readily accepted by a lot of people here
3617841 the panamera is to have the space luxury and ambience of a true limousine and the handling and performance of an executive sedan
3617842 my understanding is that the car from a performance point of view has an issue in that it is almost too good the 911 is the benchmark car
3617843 from the performance point of view it has exceeded the benchmarks
3617844 it is purely a conquest car people arent going to buy a panamera instead of a cayenne
3617845 the smaller 4wd segment doesnt make any sense for porsche
3617846 it is even more mass market and we are not going to change the business model of porsche to compete in a mass market segment
3617847 the excise offset has to be calculated by reference to a historical carbon price but the trouble is how do you make sure that the carbon price at the pump only results in a price increase that is equal to the excise offset

3617862 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3617863 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3617864 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3617865 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3617866 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3617867 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3617897 young people i mean the stats show clearly that most people charged with public nuisance offences are between 16 and 24
3617898 every day people in queensland are pleading guilty and being convicted of public nuisance offences when the higher courts have made it clear that the sorts of behaviour they are pleading guilty to in fact is not worthy of criminal sanction

3617906 theyre big league hitters theyre a great hitting team i left some balls up and they hit them well i couldnt make an adjustment at that point i know i can do better than this
3617907 he competed he threw the ball over the plate for the most part the fifth unraveled but it unraveled on everybody
3617908 to hit two grand slams in one inning who can expect that somebodys going to do that
3617909 its history its unbelievable its one of the best moments in my career and to hit two grand slams in one inning you dont get to see that every day
3617910 of course it is it is for every player its good for every player
3617911 i felt fine just like the last few times out
3617912 i wanted to mix in more changeups i threw some in counts that i normally wouldnt throw them in but we decided to go with it because i wanted to get a few more in
3617913 it could change overnight and he could be called up for his next start at the big league level
3617914 i thought chad moeller did a real nice job with him using all his pitches
3617915 there were a few occasions where he threw his breaking ball behind in the count and he threw it for strikes he mixed his changeup in well
3617916 for phil to be successful at the major league level he has to be able to do that when you get a pitcher that can throw something other than a fastball when hes behind in the count the hitter cant sit back on the fastball theres a little doubt in his mind i thought thats what phil did well
3617917 the only thing i know of was to make sure he threw enough changeups
3617918 thats the pitch he needs to be able to command that was the biggest objective making sure he reached a quota of changeups mixed in there
3617919 its another pitch to keep hitters on their toes you cant sit back and look fastball against phil because he had the good breaking ball going when you change something front to back like that with the changeup it puts a third pitch in the hitters minds and can keep him off balance
3617920 i guess my next outing will be around 90 plus pitches
3617921 from that aspect i feel ready to go and physically i feel fine
3617922 i think for many of them its broadening their horizons
3617923 from talking to the boys and well find out from talking to the girls this was their first opportunity to fly in a plane and to get out of their city it allows them to see people from other parts of the country and the world
3617924 as a matter of fact only one girl on the team had ever been on an airplane before
3617925 i think it gives them the opportunity to see other people from different parts of the country and is a great experience for them
3617926 i cant wait to get out there and talk to other teams and just have fun
3617927 the support we get from kpmg not just for the tournament but locally beyond playing baseball and softball theyre teaching the kids financial literacy and college planning and theyre even helping the adults because they are an accounting firm and so they are teaching them how to budget and inventory their equipment so they can build solid programs and organizations to reach more kids

3617949 i think that was probably about three weeks ago i think ive learned to overcome i cant affect that sort of outcome all i know is that i can go out there and throw one pitch at a time wherever they hit it so be it just try to limit the runs i felt i definitely did a good job of it i had the tough sixth inning i had to bear down and i wasnt able to get manny out
3617950 i think when i was in philly i was able to get him
3617951 i wasnt able to get my foot down in time where i was able to get that control i needed i couldnt get that last pitch in there where i wanted it
3617952 in different circumstances he would have rolled over on it he stayed through it and hit a jam shot over the shortstop what am i going to do sometimes you need a little luck
3617953 if he keeps pitching the way hes doing were going to score some runs its unfortunate because hes had tough luck

3617966 o de p ra e o de uva tinham o gosto de como se voc estivesse tentando ao mesmo tempo mastigar um chiclete com aquele sabor e comesse um chocolate m amp ms
3617967 nem mesmo a pena faz desse doce parecer menos inapropriado
3617968 prefiro tentar a sorte com um saco de feij ezinhos de todos os sabores do que comer um doce com sabor de melancia deliberadamente
3617969 por sorte para os f s de doces a embalagem impede qualquer engano
3617970 se voc gosta de marshmallow macio misturado com pasta de dente e coberto com uma fina camada de chocolate ent o voc vai adorar sapos de menta
3617971 este eu tenho que dizer uma grande decep o pelo menos em rela o tem tica
3617972 porque ele tem gosto de uma goma gigante de uva
3617973 tem gosto bem melhor do que voc pensaria que unic rnios teriam
3617974 horr vel quando voc as coloca na sua boca mas quando voc mastiga m gico
3617975 eles t m sabor de crian as mal humoradas mas sem tanta amargura
3617976 eles s o basicamente bolas de gude envoltas com a car e feitas de doce de chiclete
3617977 foi como ter uma bala com oito vezes mais a car
3617978 se alguma vez eu decidir comer qualquer coisa origin ria de unic rnios ou gotas de qualquer tipo espero que tenham esse gosto
3617979 em vez disso parece mais uma rara mistura de pasta de coco com morango
3617980 esfarelado demasiadamente doce e inexplicavelmente algo rosa grudando as bolas umas nas outras

3618005 jacque is the only person i know who took all out of town visitors to the library like a regular tourist stop
3618006 she would light up just talking about the library and people were frequently drawn to jacque her enthusiasm was contagious enough to sell the friends to many new members
3618007 she was always going the extra mile getting help for teachers and getting books in the hands of kids i recall one occasion when one of the winners of our annual poetry contest for six graders could not make the awards ceremony jacque arranged to present the award in front of her class so the student would receive the recognition she had earned
3618008 news jacque schadle childrens department funded for ashe co public library

3618022 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3618023 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3618024 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3618025 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america

3618029 we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
3618030 then the united states works on a deal with poland to establish a ballistic missile defense system in that country now we are going to tell russia that they are out of line for what they are doing so if russia wants to put a ballistic missile defense system in cuba our governemnt should understand and not object

3618033 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3618034 if it means staying in this country for six months i will do that
3618035 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement mr tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3618036 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3618037 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3618038 yes we remain committed to dialogue but we want a fair power sharing arrangement
3618039 we will now have to go back to the people and explain our position they can go ahead and form their government we made our position clear that this issue is now in the hands of the facilitator
3618040 the president has said they have not collapsed and that is the position

3618056 although we prefer those previously employed in the sports betting private sector past government workers are also encouraged to apply for this position
3618057 we also want highly motivated individuals with a background in sports betting marketing on the internet
3618058 mostly because our internet sales division is booming and we need to explore all marketing opportunities within this important medium
3618059 with the recent boom in the sports betting market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
3618060 our hr department is by far the largest unit at hoskie mace inc
3618061 and rightly so with stock par values increasing by the month we need more and more hirees to satisfy our growing corportate needs
3618062 its important for all our top hires to know individuals within the industry and individuals within our company this makes marketing and sales work much easier and more efficient so if your uncle bob at a major sports betting firm offers you a job youre advised to take it
3618063 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
3618064 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
3618065 last month after the closure of dennis otool inc we hired nearly half of all their admin staff in one week
3618066 and this has really helped our business in many ways and given these people another chance at having meaningful employment in this sports betting industry
3618067 this new program has really helped our sports betting company
3618068 and it also allows us to see what other firms are offering to new job applicants this helps get an edge on the competition and strengthens our human capital greatly

3618089 i dont feel any pressure to pick a date harbaugh said after the teams first scrimmage of camp which was closed to the media and public
3618090 in terms of running the team all the little things harbaugh said
3618091 were not talking about a huge difference weve got three guys that we believe we can win with weve just got to train them all like theyre going to be the starter
3618092 some people look at this as almost a negative thing but its really not he said
3618093 its a positive thing to where our team is absolutely confident that whoever coach says is going to start aug 28 were going to have complete confidence in
3618094 at some point youve got to start narrowing down the first guy will take more reps than the second guy and the second guy will take more reps than the third guy but we run enough plays in practice where i feel
3618095 since practice six they have really made great strides all in different ways because theyre different harbaugh said
3618096 but weve been pushing the offensive tempo this camp and i think its going to help

3618100 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
3618101 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
3618102 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
3618103 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
3618104 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
3618105 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
3618106 we are confident that every senator and the liberal opposition will want to look closely at the data from the tax office
3618107 that early data shows that there has been an overall reduction in consumption as a result of our measure and that is significant
3618108 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed

3618111 now there came to ephesus a jew named apollos a native of alexandria he was an eloquent man well versed in the scriptures he had been instructed in the way of the lord and he spoke with burning enthusiasm and taught accurately the things concerning jesus though he knew only the baptism of john he began to speak boldly in the synagogue but when priscilla and aquila heard him they took him aside and explained the way of god to him more accurately
3618112 were too busy the house is a mess he has rough edges
3618113 iron sharpens iron and one person sharpens the wits of another
3618114 when the apostle paul arrived in ephesus he began to speak about the person of jesus christ to people who had never heard the name of jesus
3618115 he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly and argued persuasively about the kingdom of god when some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the way before the congregation he left them taking the disciples with him and argued daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus this continued for two years so that all the residents of asia both jews and greeks heard the word of the lord

3618119 deze actie laat de rechtvaardiging zien van microsofts pogingen om haar draconische opvatting over security in te ruilen voor een open aanpak waarbij het lekken en aanvallen bij de horens neemt en actief samenwerkt met beveiligingsonderzoekers in plaats van te doen alsof ze niet bestaan door de onderzoeksgemeenschap te negeren
3618120 niemand twijfelt aan apples vermogen om een leuk product te ontwikkelen of enthousiasme voor een presentatie te genereren het niet in contact treden met de security en gebruikersgemeenschap is heel iets anders en iets waar apple in tekortschiet het is tijd dat de mensen in cupertino hun toon wijzigen en beginnen met praten
3618121 apple is de laatste tijd ook steeds stiller over huidige gebeurtenissen zoals de gezondheid van steve jobs en de status van zijn producten de meeste it bedrijven kiezen de andere kant ze publiceren dagelijks updates over hun werk en nodigen lezers uit om te reageren ze vragen om verbeteringen en gaan de discussie aan
3618122 when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some scoffed but others said we will hear you again about this
3618123 in their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god
3618124 we have walked together in hard and in pleasant places
3618125 in all this range of experiences there is something of inestimable value which cannot be taken from us as the truths and joys of life are gifts of god
3618126 we do not live to ourselves and we do not die to ourselves if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords for to this end christ died and lived again so that he might be lord of both the dead and the living
3618127 has not god chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him but you have insulted the poor
3618128 if you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me

3618145 if israel will not support our choice of an independent palestinian state in the occupied territories including east jerusalem then the alternative demand of the palestinian people and leadership will be a bi national state
3618146 israel has in effect presented us only with a third option after its bantustan isation of the occupied territories
3618147 that is to accept a state of leftovers but this is simply not acceptable if israel does not agree to a two state solution based on the 1967 borders we have to ask for a one state solution
3618148 its a threat because it basically waves the demographic issue in israels face
3618149 its a mistaken threat its overused the last time it led to the unilateral israeli disengagement process and most israelis are still in favour of unilateral disengagement if this threat turns into more than a threat the israeli response would be more unilateralism
3618150 its very hard for outsiders to gauge weve seen statements that say theyre making good progress and statements to the opposite effect all of these are tactics designed by both sides to create pressure but i think the general issue that has to be faced is that both leaderships are extremely weak
3618151 the statement means one of two things either qurei wants something more in negotiations or he wants a completely new israeli position regardless the positions are very far apart on all issues on borders on jerusalem on refugees i dont think the israelis are going to give in on these issues to meet minimum palestinian demands

3618157 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homo phobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
3618158 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean
3618159 i know i talk with god and god replies people prefer to speak about the force of circumstances rather than miracles but i think miracles happen to everyone all the time
3618160 i have to do two things forget and find spiritual peace and be able to forgive when i do this ill also have to recall my memories but perhaps in time these wont be so painful
3618161 if i had not had the lord at my side i dont think i could have overcome this suffering
3618162 being a hostage places you in a situation of constant humiliation you are a victim of total arbitrariness and you get to know whats most vile in the human spirit
3618163 faced by this there are two paths you either let yourself grow ugly bitter peevish and vindictive and let your heart fill with spite or you choose the other path which jesus showed us when he asked us to bless our enemies

3618167 the partial lunar eclipse which begins at 1 06 07 am on august 17 and ends at 4 14 16 am will be visible in india

3618169 for instance while south america would be witnessing the eclipse during moon rise on the evening of august 16 australia would be witnessing it during moonset on the morning of august 17 although the two regions will be witnessing it at the same intrinsic time
3618170 when the us ran the canal it was a government operation hence a money drain now it is run strictly as a business its owned by panama but is an independent business designed to make money for panama last year i think the direct contribution i e heres a check from the canal was something like 700m when the expansion is completed the direct contribution is expected to be something like 1 2b now the canal works on an ala carte basis you pay according to the number of pilots tugs mules lines etc the average ship is paying more like 400k plus per full or partial transit the money from the canal is filtering down in projects all across panama including the road past our house and a new town basketball court thank you all very much

3618173 those who can not gain access to information will lag behind the rest of the country
3618174 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3618175 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3618176 the struggle will continue but primarily in the field of international diplomacy
3618177 most likely neither side will win this public relations war decisively in the near future
3618178 my best guess is that russian military operations will end relatively soon after securing south ossetia against any new georgian moves and possibly also after helping abkhazia retake the kodori gorge he said
3618179 in regards to south ossetia specifically i expect the security situation there to stabilize following the events of the past weekend
3618180 i think the real test now for both sides will be dealing with the aftermath the recognition of the region which is likely to be one of russias conditions and its eventual reconstruction
3618181 even with all the conflicting information coming out of south ossetia over the past four days i think everyone can agree that the region will be in severe need of humanitarian and financial aid
3618182 the best case scenario is that once the russians have secured south ossetia and perhaps abkhazia they will stop attacking targets in the rest of georgia
3618183 south ossetia and abkhazia will effectively become part of russia though moscow itself may still acknowledge them as being part of georgia
3618184 this new government will insist on greatly increasing the transit fees for azeri oil going through the baku ceyhan pipeline russia will then turn its attention to reasserting control over azerbaijan
3618185 this is not because of the quality of treatment in beijing far from it but because the hospital in hong kong has specialised equipment hill may need
3618186 we hope he pulls through he is an australian we are giving him as much assistant as possible
3618187 he is not only good at his job he is well respected and well liked from the stewards to the jockeys to the trainers and thats something hes achieved in a short space of time
3618188 hes always been that sort of guy that you knew would make it to the top in race calling and sports broadcasting in general
3618189 it was a big step for him and he was really looking forward to it especially the equestrian events its just really unfortunate whats happened
3618190 he always tried so hard and it seems the conditions over there have affected some of the athletes as well as some of the commentators
3618191 i spoke to him in the lead up to the olympics and he was really excited about it and wide eyed he couldnt wait for the opportunity
3618192 its just deep enough to where the waves dissipate and the turbulence dissipates down to the bottom

3618195 a think tank linked to and headquartered at parti gerakan
3618196 just because dap is asking do you think i should dance to their tune
3618197 this implies that the party needs to stay firm and true to a non racial approach that eschews racism
3618198 or should it fail to do so within the time span set it must then seriously consider leaving the bn and to independently develop the party as a serious multi racial social democratic party
3618199 we will not grow so fast as we want to grow our core competence right now we are also limited by the facilities so we cannot host more people

3618218 we defended well and never gave up i thought we created some problems in attack and on another night we could have scored

3618234 we can only assume your ill timed and poorly conceived pursuit of republic is designed to disrupt what you perceive as a competitive threat to your position in the market
3618235 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3618236 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth
3618237 finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3618238 our striking result is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust
3618239 patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3618240 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through

3618323 this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
3618324 further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets people with lewy body disease suffer memory loss visual hallucinations and movement difficulties
3618325 unfortunately research is severely underfunded and much more is needed if we are to defeat this devastating disease

3618361 the idea is to train students from the school level for competitive tests like maharashtra talent search and national talent search students in the academy will be initially trained for these exams and for events like mathex and science olympiads
3618362 during classes 11 and 12 they will also be trained for iit jee and aieee
3618363 the infrastructure of s p college including its laboratory and qualified faculty will be used for training students will be admitted in class 8 and can avail training till class 12 in physics chemistry mathematics and biology it will also help to bridge the gap between school and college education

3618379 these results significantly improve our understanding of the 3 d reconnection process with a null pair structure the observations and suggested scenario pave the way for future studies on reconnection not only for space physicists but also for the astrophysical and laboratory plasmas communities since the chance of such in situ measurements is expected to be very rare
3618380 the results will also provide a valuable reference for the nasa magnetospheric multiscale mms mission and the esa cross scale mission a primary goal of these future missions is to measure the 3 d geometry of the inner reconnection region the results reported in grl present new observations and an associated scenario in such a region for the first time
3618381 this is indeed precisely the aim of the cross scale mission studying the heart of magnetic reconnection by measuring the electron scale near the null with four spacecraft as well as studying ion and fluid scales
3618382 the iau damaged the public perception of science by the high profile spectacle of imposing by vote a controversial definition of a commonly used term
3618383 too often science is presented as lists of facts to be learned from authority instead of the dynamic open ended process that it really is the iau reinforced this misconception of science
3618384 the importance of the ongoing debate is that it provides an opportunity to show the public how science really works in an area of great interest
3618385 there are also many areas on which we will agree
3618386 im hoping our debate will give the public a better understanding of why these differing views on planets serve the different purposes of various kinds of scientists and will illuminate the extent to which those purposes are narrow or broad
3618387 this was comparable to or more than the number who voted in favor of the iaus planet definition in 2006
3618388 the public and even many scientists are confused about what this means and wonder if asteroids crossing the orbits of earth and even jupiter compromise their planetary status because these are objects that have not been cleared from their orbits
3618389 if pluto were half the mass of uranus it would still not be a planet
3618390 and if the earth traded places with jupiter earth would not be a planet its like saying a fruit becomes a vegetable if you move it to the other side of the table
3618391 the iau definition better worded may be useful for identifying those objects that gravitationally dominate their vicinity or perhaps those objects that managed to sweep up most of the mass of the primordial disk of the solar system but it does not help us understand which objects orbiting the sun should have similar physical characteristics
3618392 and it is those physical characteristics that we go to study with spacecraft
3618393 when i first started in this business a large fraction of planetary scientists were astronomers who had cut their teeth on earth based telescopes
3618394 since then weve been flooded with data coming back from close flybys orbiters landers and rovers most of the planetary science questions being asked today are geophysical and geological planetary science is merging with terrestrial science to become real comparative planetology only a small fraction of the planetary science community belongs to the iau anymore
3618395 for planetary scientists it makes more sense to have a planet definition that is motivated by the physical characteristics of the objects
3618396 it has no geology and in fact jupiter may have more in common with sub stellar brown dwarfs than earth by comparison i expect that when nasas dawn mission reaches ceres in 2015 we will see very interesting geology and possible evidence for a subsurface ocean the hubble space telescope has revealed ceres to be unique in the asteroid belt having round shape and a very smooth surface likely as a consequence of its icy mantle likewise pluto will be visited by nasas new horizons mission in 2015 to study its geology and atmosphere
3618397 its good for people to know that debate in science is the norm
3618398 science is dynamic science is argumentative science is continual testing and challenging science is not about something everyone has to memorize because some organization has given it its blessing
3618399 at the end of the day scientific debate is a tool we use to increase our knowledge and understanding it is also fun

3618438 our sensor has already been successfully tested on earth we are very pleased to be selected by ags and orbital to participate in this groundbreaking initiative and look forward to testing our sensor from geo synchronous altitude
3618439 fire eagle is about making everything on the internet more useful fun or interesting by adding the element of location
3618440 were here to help people take their location to the web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with
3618441 the combination of outside ins new radar feature and fire eagles amazingly simple and powerful api means that our users can now see all the news and buzz within 1 000 feet of their current location updated from any number of applications and devices
3618442 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
3618443 pownce users can now say where they are and geotag their notes which adds a new dimension to the service
3618444 so we had to develop a new type of miniaturized sensor to measure re entry conditions for spacecraft the sensors had to be very small and capable of measuring oxygen at high altitudes and during re entry
3618445 it is very easy to find terrestrial applications for this miniaturized gas sensor the sensor reacts very fast and this is useful in many cases where you need to measure ambient conditions on earth
3618446 one application where the sensor is particularly useful is measurement of the human breath with this sensor we can measure oxygen carbon dioxide and the flow of human breath and obtain the results immediately something which is impossible with the conventional systems
3618447 the sensor works well with combustible gasses and can be used to optimise the burners in industrial plants and home heating systems if you place the sensor in the exhaust gases you can control the heaters in real time by using a special algorithm and ensure that the burner operates at an optimum level
3618448 this system can reduce the exhaust gases that are harmful for the environment and at the same time by ensuring the heating system works at an optimum level it can also reduce fuel consumption by about 10 to 15
3618449 we will see more technology spinning back into space in the future
3618450 while location industry value chains have long remained fragmented the ongoing trend towards consolidation is finally moving the location based services industry into a mature stage

3618463 the bullpen i watched in baltimore i was so excited

3618465 he went down and did exactly what we wanted him to do
3618466 instead of doing it in the big leagues he did it in triple a he learned how to four seam the ball
3618467 when i pounded the zone with the cutter it seemed like they hit every mistake pitch
3618468 thats one thing that is different up here from the minors theyre going to hit all the mistakes
3618469 it was everything i got to see in baltimore plus a little bit more

3618614 this age bracket is comprised of teenagers who are only beginning to learn what responsibility means
3618615 and should set aside their political activities for a while
3618616 disempower the people particularly the youth at the local level and contradict the essence of the devolution of the government
3618617 deepening democracy in the way we organize our politics entails having accessible local government units in this case the countrys youth having direct and meaningful participation in the affairs of government must be one of the solutions to its problems
3618618 it must be empowered to give the body oversight powers to make sk officials accountable to their constituency in terms of clear processes in development planning budgeting and disbursement of funds
3618619 well he was on his way over to my house the other day and when he arrived outside the house he didnt brake properly and boom he hit the pavement and the car flips up and he crashed through the sunroof went flying through the air and smashed through my upstairs bedroom window
3618620 no no he survived that that didnt kill him at all so hes landed in my upstairs bedroom and hes all covered in broken glass on the floor then he spots the big old antique wardrobe we have in the room and reaches up for the handle to try to pull himself up hes just dragging himself up when bang this massive wardrobe comes crashing down on top of him crushing him and breaking most of his bones

3618627 in demanding the zamboanga city council issue a formal apology
3618628 for the inflammatory statement and for instigating unnecessary anti media sentiment
3618629 personal condemnation of a journalist on the basis of their reporting through a formal council resolution is an act of harassment and an attack on press freedom
3618630 quoted from different sources duly identified in the articles they were uttered by personalities campaigning against the controversial and emotional bje issue
3618631 all parties involved must understand the important duty of journalists to report fairly on all sides and intimidation of this kind can not be tolerated
3618632 as the philippines media mourns the murder of two broadcast journalists last week
3618633 dismayed at this unwarranted incitement of anti media sentiment by authority figures not only towards jacinto but all journalists in the philippines

3618638 you were just picking up garbage off the floor and not challenging me to a cage match
3618639 ive owned more than a dozen impalas ranging from 59 to 64 the prior impala that i owned i had completely restored and had it for some eight years unfortunately in life we must make sacrifices and that impala was used to obtain a home for my family
3618640 there was a hole in my heart that needed to be filled
3618641 i knew that i would have to start all over again so i started a search for a impala project car
3618642 one thing only i know and that is that i know nothing

3618645 they do not love that do not show their love

3618647 when you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave
3618648 love for thy love and hand for hand i give

3618650 love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books but love from love toward school with heavy looks

3618659 if we break the vat chain we will lose all the revenues if we really have to replace the vat with an excise tax we suggest that the excess tax will maintain the revenues of tax
3618660 shifting the form of taxation on crude oil and petroleum products from vat to excise tax
3618661 vat is a progressive tax it will benefit lower income groups while higher income groups who purchase luxury items will pay higher taxes it is better to collect the tax and allocate the proceeds to direct transfers to the poor
3618662 i cannot understand why there is an increasing vat collection but decreasing budget for social services where did the other vat collections go
3618663 non lifeline consumers pay for both the vat and discount of lifeline consumers

3618668 the renewed fighting in north cotabato goes to show that when the government bungles the peace negotiation it is the citizens who suffer
3618669 we have been at peace for over 20 years and the peace process has been mishandled we are being victimized every now and then by small groups that threaten to bomb or occupy some areas
3618670 the imminent refugee crisis is an unacceptable cost of the governments mismanagement of the peace process a peace process should lead to the protection of life and property and yet whats happening is the opposite
3618671 can they deliver their troops dictate to their people in the group to stop the hostilities i dont think they have the moral ascendancy to actually end this
3618672 have grossly violated the contracts by converting the timberland into agri business plantations such as pineapple sugarcane and jathropa production
3618673 on atienzas birthday we wish him to have a vision for the poor being the head of the governments environment office may he be an instrument in our effort to have access and security over the land

3618697 the officials say the bomb appear to have targeted a military bus in central nour square they say wednesdays explosion took place as the streets were full of people heading to work
3618698 the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media
3618699 tripoli has witnessed sectarian clashes in the past weeks that killed and wounded dozens of people
3618700 the city is also close to the palestinian refugee camp of nahr el bared which witnessed deadly clashes last year between lebanese troops and members of the al qaida inspired group fatah islam
3618701 no you did something right and id like to tell your manager

3618703 gee i am not thrashing my lungs and this stuff is practically good for me
3618704 but recovering alcoholics tend to smoke less than drink coffee
3618705 is there something in coffee that may be protective against relapse is there something in cigarettes that may actually reduce the likelihood of relapse
3618706 this finding supports the potential role that nicotine can play in alcohol addiction
3618707 but we dont know how nicotine and alcohol react to keep each other going
3618708 my prediction would be that the relapse rate among smokers is higher
3618709 the drug inhibits the effect of nicotine and by doing that you may also reduce the euphoric effects of alcohol at the same time
3618710 the care and welfare of residents is our primary concern
3618711 if other facilities are found to be non compliant action will be taken
3618712 20 20 that night i am sure was no way factored into the timing of the announcement
3618713 when i made the woman she had to be special i made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world yet gentle enough to give comfort
3618714 i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children
3618715 i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining
3618716 i gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances even when her child has hurt her very badly
3618717 i gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart
3618718 i gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly
3618719 the beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes because that is the doorway to her heart the place where love resides
3618720 critics of the administration have every reason to be wary of charter change especially since this has always been tied to maneuvers to keep arroyo in power beyond 2010 there is nothing in the track record of this government which says it can be trusted with amending the constitution
3618721 the ensuing armed tension from the impasse in the signing may have also been a calculated risk by the regime so that it could play the federalism via charter change card the escalation of hostilities puts pressure on congress to adopt changes in the constitution
3618722 arroyos resurrection of charter change deserves the peoples outrage thats one way of stopping this ambitious brutal and corrupt politician in malaca ang

3618733 tambi n tenemos la informaci n de que los mercenarios son instruidos por asesores militares norteamericanos que no participan en las hostilidades

3618742 poverty is the serious illness that causes all troubles and the governments formula of solving the poverty problem in mindanao is lacking
3618743 failed to prescribe the right medicines for the illness of the people in mindanao
3618744 the solution is for every people in mindanao to plant his area with the support of the government and that support is needed during harvest time there are a lot of high value crops that are suitable to mindanao but are never found in mindanao because of the lack of government support

3618747 for four years we knew we could probably get under 7 minutes
3618748 i could not believe how close to me those guys were
3618749 i was more or less trying to count my strokes hoping id be dead on at the turns
3618750 im disappointed because i know i can go faster but there was nothing i could do i handled it the best way i could
3618751 to be in the same group with the greatest olympians who ever lived to have the most golds in history is unbelievable
3618752 after the fly i was trying to focus but i just kept thinking wow the greatest olympian of all time thats a pretty cool title
3618753 many factors are contributing to this we are now trying to manage that as for the olympic green yesterday they saw not many people inside
3618754 its the season for traveling and last year the hotel was full the olympics should have brought business to beijing but the reality is too far from the expectation
3618755 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3618756 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3618757 weve seen from past games experience that each host country and its cultures has differing appreciations for the various sports which means some venues are packed others not so
3618758 as regards beijing for the venues that arent full the organizers are working on how to offer students and others the chance to see and learn about the sports
3618759 our company sends us to softball today but other workers were sent to other venues to do some work we come here on shifts
3618760 olympics go go go china go go go beijing go go go
3618761 the volunteers are assigned to cheer for both sides in order to provide good atmosphere the responsibility rests with the venue managers if they find there are not enough people too many empty seats they should organize some cheerleaders
3618762 my colleagues tried to buy online but were out of luck i tried to line up to buy tickets but it was so impossibly crowded i think that some tickets for foreign countries are not sold out or some people who bought the tickets but could not enter china
3618763 there were quite a lot empty seats in front of me
3618764 i suspect the empty seats are free tickets its unfair as soon as i saw the empty seats i was annoyed
3618765 im going to watch diving in several days the tickets are from my boyfriends company which is one of the sponsors from what i understand they couldnt give all their tickets away last weekend what a waste
3618766 we love playing we love winning when you get the emotions of the olympics going on its something special and you cant really describe it
3618767 you should never give up on those who have obsessive compulsive disorder and autism
3618768 it takes time a lot of patience and it takes a while to cope with it dont go down without a fight stay strong
3618769 we realized that we had so many referrals for kids with autism that we wanted to have something amazing to offer
3618770 we use the association for behavior analysis aba methods but we wanted to be out of the box and creative with our program because every child learns differently
3618771 its things we take for granted that they might not know
3618772 i thought it had a natural feel at the school
3618773 change even positive change is scary for us but change is horrifying for kids on the spectrum
3618774 he views it as a game its fun he doesnt have to sit behind a desk thats just one example of how were able to think out of the box and apply instruction according to the kid

3618777 excuse me mr booth i really enjoy your writing and
3618778 i wish to extend my sincerest sympathies to bob leeks family its so easy to criticize but we should recognize the great work of everyone who responded to this devastating event
3618779 i was within 10km of the incident and it was truly terrifying even from a safe distance
3618780 my heart goes out to the employee and firefighter killed in this accident it is fortunate that not more people got injured or killed
3618781 he is just another person but maybe from a different planet
3618782 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3618783 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3618784 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3618785 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3618786 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3618787 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3618788 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3618789 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3618790 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3618791 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3618792 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3618793 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3618794 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3618795 she sounded like she was going to die she said she didnt know how this happened that it wasnt supposed to happen that way amp shes not doing well she had a confrontation with somebody and shes in the psychiatric ward right now
3618796 they told me not to come back to get her because they would drive her home when i called later that day i left a message and i never heard from her javon was only 7 months old
3618797 she just stood there with her hands down like she was drugged up
3618798 i was screaming and crying and she just stood there ria used to be such a lively jolly person and the other people would not let me see the baby
3618799 youd hear it in the middle of the night loud noises and chanting
3618800 they were real strange theyd wear all white or camouflage and talk about demons and devils all the time people just left them alone
3618801 the leader of the cult queen antoinette made the decision she was the one that said do not feed him and would beat javon and put him in a back room
3618802 the queen told everyone that god was going to raise javon from the dead
3618803 he was such a nice little boy i got him a swing and he used to love to be on that swing and he had a playpen with a teddy bear and once he got in there the first thing he would do was talk to that teddy bear

3618806 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3618807 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3618808 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3618809 everyone knows the next one could be ukraine and then poland all of europe should be here now
3618810 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3618811 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3618812 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3618813 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3618814 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3618815 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3618816 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3618817 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3618818 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3618819 she is a very dangerous person no doubt about it
3618820 this is a major haul a major capture for the fbi
3618821 to find someone who has such rich information computer hard drives e mails that is really a major capture
3618822 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3618823 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3618824 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3618825 were proud of our role as americas first line of defense against foreign animal diseases
3618826 were equally proud of our safety record not once in our nearly 50 years of operation has an animal pathogen escaped from the island
3618827 we know that he has been involved in terrorist planning with senior al qaeda leaders overseas and has scouted sites across america that might be vulnerable to terrorist attack
3618828 the warrant officer saw and heard siddique fire at least two shots as interpreter 1 tried to wrestle the gun from her no one was hit the warrant officer heard siddique exclaim allah akbar another interpreter interpreter 2 heard siddique yell in english get the f out of here as she fired the rifle
3618829 her medical condition is that she was shot in the abdomen there are stitches that run from the breast plate area down to the belly button area layers and layers of tissue have been sewn sutured we have heard reports that she has lost a kidney we dont know if those are accurate but we are concerned about that there has been intestinal damage part of the intestines we understand have been removed

3618843 ayah saya tidak mau melanjutkan sekolah lagi saya telah cukup
3618844 mengapa kau mempunyai jiwa yang begitu keparat lemahnya bahkan jika berarti ayah mesti mengemis di jalanan ayah akan menyekolahkan kamu berdua sampai selesai
3618845 seorang anak laki laki harus meneruskan sekolahnya kalau tidak ia tidak akan pernah meninggalkan jurang kemiskinan ini
3618846 kak masuk ke universitas tidaklah mudah saya akan pergi mencari kerja dan mengirimmu uang
3618847 mengapa kamu tidak bilang pada teman sekamarku kalau kamu adalah adikku
3618848 lihat bagaimana penampilanku apa yang akan mereka pikir jika mereka tahu saya adalah adikmu apa mereka tidak akan
3618849 saya melihat semua adis kota memakainya jadi saya pikir kamu juga harus memiliki satu
3618850 bu ibu tidak perlu menghabiskan begitu banyak waktu untuk membersihkan rumah kita
3618851 itu adalah adikmu yang pulang awal untuk membersihkan rumah ini tidakkah kamu melihat luka pada angannya ia terluka ketika memasang kaca jendela baru itu
3618852 kak jagalah mertuamu saja saya akan menjaga ibu dan ayah di sini
3618853 mengapa kamu menolak menjadi manajer manajer tidak akan pernah harus melakukan sesuatu yang berbahaya seperti ini lihat kamu sekarang luka yang begitu serius mengapa kamu tidak mau mendengar kami sebelumnya
3618854 pikirkan kakak ipar ia baru saja jadi direktur dan saya hampir tidak berpendidikan jika saya menjadi manajer seperti itu berita seperti
3618855 ketika saya pergi sekolah sd sekolah kami ada di dusun yang berbeda setiap hari kakak dan saya berjalan selama dua jam untuk pergi ke sekolah dan pulang ke rumah suatu hari saya kehilangan satu dari sarung tanganku kakakku memberikan satu dari kepunyaannya sedangkan ia hanya memakai satu saja dan berjalan sejauh itu ketika kami tiba di rumah tangannya begitu gemetaran karena cuaca yang begitu dingin sampai ia tidak dapat memegang sumpitnya sejak hari itu saya bersumpah selama saya masih hidup saya akan menjaga kakakku dan baik kepadanya
3618856 dalam hidupku orang yang paling aku berterima kasih adalah adikku
3618857 it will be a venue for creative and innovative ways to encourage truth telling and to search for truth
3618858 an unprecedented performance activity in defiance of the rule of the untruth of society
3618859 nine days from now filipino artists will converge in one place in manila in our pursuit of truth we learn to order our priorities and in the process learn to transform our lives
3618860 because artists are also citizens today we wish to announce a major undertaking of filipino artists as citizens
3618861 the artists are doing it hand in hand with all the sectors of our society
3618862 artists play a fundamental and continuing role in making our nation we have time and again taken up the responsibility to use the arts in crystallizing issues and principles and reinforcing our peoples commitment towards a collective endeavor especially during times of crisis
3618863 celebration and not a protest the program will mainly be song presentations cultural performances and a creative expression of the whole community

3618866 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homophobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
3618867 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean
3618868 i know i talk with god and god replies people prefer to speak about the force of circumstances rather than miracles but i think miracles happen to everyone all the time
3618869 i have to do two things forget and find spiritual peace and be able to forgive when i do this ill also have to recall my memories but perhaps in time these wont be so painful
3618870 if i had not had the lord at my side i dont think i could have overcome this suffering
3618871 being a hostage places you in a situation of constant humiliation you are a victim of total arbitrariness and you get to know whats most vile in the human spirit
3618872 faced by this there are two paths you either let yourself grow ugly bitter peevish and vindictive and let your heart fill with spite or you choose the other path which jesus showed us when he asked us to bless our enemies
3618873 our grand old musharraf has not been passing on all the 1 billion 520m a year that the americans have been giving for the armed forces
3618874 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer we are talking about 700m a year missing the rest has been taken by mush pervez musharraf for some scheme or other and we have got to find it
3618875 i think he has a slush fund being used for this and for some activity for the future
3618876 they spent all the money so we would have to borrow they did not pass on the increased price of oil nor added a single extra megawatt of power in the last 10 years all these things were deliberately thought out so at the end of day they can turn round and tell the world look democracy doesnt deliver and step back in
3618877 i have not touched one thing in her bedroom her manuscript of her last book is lying on her side and i sleep on my side
3618878 i think she is looking at us now and saying now tell me asif do you think its easy
3618879 to say we are responsible for the country yes we are but first get your role model pervez musharraf out of the way remove your most allied of allies
3618880 they bush cheney junta have had musharraf there 10 years instead of bringing these issues up with him they are trying to bring them up with us today
3618881 the offer was on the table that you walk and you dont get prosecuted but i have had no returns so have had no choice but to go along with my partners more aggressive stance
3618882 if he does it it will be his last verdict against the people the peoples mandate and against pakistan
3618883 our bedroom in dubai has been locked and i sleep in the next room because the children and i dont want to lose her scent in the room
3618884 the scope for a much faster recovery in the dollar is still limited by relatively poor economic fundamentals in the us
3618885 the friends of the lake cities library are filled with a dynamic team of volunteers who are having an amazingly successful year
3618886 safe to assume that the general consensus in congress is to change the constitution
3618887 the results of the survey are interesting but i am not surprised i am concerned about the pronouncements made by the president and if it will have any bearing on our committee hearings
3618888 while we support the moro peoples struggle for self determination we will not allow their legitimate cause to be used as a means for arroyo to inflict far reaching damage on the people and the country by staying in power and removing the remaining protectionist provisions in the constitution
3618889 the basic issue is if we should amend the constitution and the extension of arroyos term is just a peripheral issue
3618890 specific not all the respondents are aware of the proposed amendments to the constitution
3618891 there will always be objections on the part of the people
3618892 i assure you that when i initiated this informal survey i initiated it on my own 100 percent and results came out even before arroyo made the pronouncements
3618893 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3618894 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3618895 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
3618896 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3618897 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3618898 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3618899 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3618900 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3618901 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3618902 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3618903 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3618904 aku nunggu bapak pulang sebab aku mau tanya berapa sih gaji bapak
3618905 lho tumben kok nanya gaji bapak mau minta uang lagi ya
3618906 oke kamu boleh hitung sendiri setiap hari bapak bekerja sekitar 10 jam dan dibayar rp 400 000 setiap bulan rata rata dihitung 22 hari kerja sabtu dan minggu libur kadang sabtu bapak masih lembur jadi gaji bapak dalam satu bulan berapa hayo
3618907 kalo satu hari bapak dibayar rp 400 000 untuk 10 jam berarti satu jam papa digaji rp 40 000 dong
3618908 sudah nggak usah macam macam lagi buat apa minta uang malam malam begini bapak capek dan mau mandi dulu tidurlah
3618909 maafkan bapak nak bapak sayang sama sari tapi buat apa sih minta uang malam malam begini kalau mau beli mainan besok kan bisa jangankan rp 5 000 lebih dari itu pun bapak kasih
3618910 pak aku enggak minta uang aku hanya pinjam nanti aku kembalikan kalau sudah menabung lagi dari uang jajan selama minggu ini
3618911 aku menunggu bapak dari jam 8 aku mau ajak bapak main ular tangga tiga puluh menit aja ibu sering bilang kalo waktu bapak itu sangat berharga jadi aku mau ganti waktu bapak aku buka tabunganku hanya ada rp 15 000 tapi karena bapak bilang satu jam bapak dibayar rp 40 000 maka setengah jam aku harus ganti rp 20 000 tapi duit tabunganku kurang rp 5 000 makanya aku mau pinjam dari bapak
3618912 wouldnt it be cool if i was like the hobgoblin from spiderman and my bouncy ball was an exploding pumpkin bomb
3618913 you are saying its a bouncy ball i dont even believe you
3618914 threw numerous white objects at his car on purpose breaking the windshield in the lower right and upper left corners
3618915 they all told me pretty much what you said which tells me that you guys are lying and rehearsed the story before i got here
3618916 but what would i have to gain from lying to you if anything i would get in more trouble if i lied im an eagle scout i dont lie ive got nothing to lie to you about
3618917 have fun with your bouncy balls and have fun with your satan fair you little satanists
3618918 im very disappointed that he didnt show any flexibility whatsoever
3618919 to say i was quite surprised was an understatement we were all shocked

3618923 the meaning of my post was to compare policies the policy of a state with military power turkey and a micky mouse state cyprus
3618924 obviously you do not care much about greece or cyprus for greece will never fight a war with turkey
3618925 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3618926 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3618927 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3618928 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3618929 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3618930 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3618931 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3618932 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3618933 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3618934 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3618935 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3618936 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3618937 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3618938 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3618939 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3618940 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3618941 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3618942 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3618943 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3618944 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3618945 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3618946 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3618947 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3618948 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3618949 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3618950 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3618951 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3618952 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3618953 we have to prove that what he did in thailand was wrong under british law
3618954 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population
3618955 seven villages have been cleared and well clear eight more today
3618956 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3618957 assuring you the best of our quality services at all times
3618958 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3618959 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3618960 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3618961 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together
3618962 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3618963 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3618964 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3618965 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3618966 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3618967 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3618968 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks

3618975 when people like and immerse themselves in something they do all they can to get all of it
3618976 an average plan implemented today is far better than a perfect plan implemented next week
3618977 dont bother with people who cant even grasp common sense
3618978 as such was incapable of forming the criminal intent for first degree murder
3618979 it is my opinion that mrs donohue suffered from a mental disorder or abnormality at the time of the alleged offense and as a result of this condition was incapable for forming the specific intent to kill
3618980 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3618981 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3618982 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3618983 if japan breaks this agreement all would collapse we will also take necessary measures
3618984 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3618985 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3618986 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3618987 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3618988 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3618989 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3618990 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3618991 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3618992 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3618993 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3618994 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3618995 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3618996 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3618997 singapore like all asean countries is committed to the principle that asean should be at the center of any regional architecture all asean dialogue partners have supported this principle prime minister rudds proposal appears to be a departure from australias previous position

3619003 it is happening it is not some imaginary story it is occurring there is no question about that
3619004 what we picked up is a step in the maintenance check which does not look like it has been completed and thats why weve got to go back and verify that
3619005 until we are absolutely certain that everything is 100 per cent correct we cannot operate the aircraft

3619018 even the most sophisticated among them airline companies have only a rudimentary understanding of who their most valuable customers are or could be which factors affect the behavior of these customers and which crm levers are most effective in ensuring loyalty
3619019 the greatest challenge however as with any customer relationship system was that it needed user acceptance throughout the organization in order to be used properly
3619020 we can now bring the information from a number of different global sales departments
3619021 the guidance and regulation of the costs and revenue of operating the catering activity in hotels restaurants
3619022 the evidence will show that bill donohue just was not involved in the caretaking of his mother

3619032 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3619033 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3619034 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3619035 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

3619099 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face

3619101 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3619102 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3619103 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened
3619104 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand

3619107 americans are tired of partisanship they want us to work together for america in a bipartisan fashion
3619108 who have a clear record of strict adherence to the constitution of the united states and who do not believe in legislating from the bench
3619109 we will fix social security and we will do it in a bipartisan fashion

3619121 maybe during the convention the republicans can dedicate a large screen monitor at the xcel center to keep track of obamas second european jaunt of the campaign they could call it where in the world is barack obama the show could track him through the summer houses of the rich and famous americans who can afford to own villas overseas and put dollar signs up on a map wherever he stops off for some foie gras

3619129 there is no system of guarantee of a place for maori women within our own institutions or within the new organisations which have evolved to manage our assets
3619130 the changes being made to our culture are freeing up the role and status of all men maori and pakeha whilst petrifying meaning ceasing to change or develop the role and status of maori women

3619133 the difference between traditional supply chain management and network orchestration is like the difference between producing a symphony on a computer with all the inputs specified and controlled within the computer and producing a symphony with a live orchestra the computer generated piece still involves great skill in specifying and coordinating all the tasks but the tasks can be controlled more or less centrally the live orchestra on the other hand depends upon the individual contributions of musicians with their own strengths weaknesses temperaments and positions in the orchestra everyone in the network plays a part but the orchestrator is responsible for delivering the right product service to the right place at the right time at the right price whereas the musicians are responsible for their specific parts the conductor is responsible for the whole

3619151 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3619152 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3619153 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3619154 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3619155 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom

3619170 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato

3619179 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3619180 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3619181 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3619182 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3619183 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3619184 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3619185 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3619186 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3619187 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3619188 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3619189 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3619190 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3619191 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3619192 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3619193 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3619194 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3619195 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3619196 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3619197 its better that the us do the drilling than china or cuba it will be a lot safer
3619198 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist

3619200 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3619201 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day

3619208 i said gordon brown is the right man for the job at the end of the day they believed in those times that that ship could never sink the captain still had a responsibility but the thing that actually sank it was the iceberg the challenge is how do you navigate around it
3619209 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime

3619213 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3619214 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3619215 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3619216 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3619217 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3619218 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3619219 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3619220 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3619221 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3619222 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3619223 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3619224 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3619225 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3619226 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3619227 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3619228 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3619229 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3619230 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3619231 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3619232 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3619233 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3619234 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3619235 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3619236 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3619237 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3619238 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3619239 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3619240 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3619241 the right to live in the world the disabled in the law of torts

3619246 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3619247 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3619248 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3619249 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3619250 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3619251 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3619252 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3619253 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3619254 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3619255 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3619256 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3619257 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3619258 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3619259 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3619260 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3619261 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3619262 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3619263 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3619264 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3619265 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3619266 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3619267 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3619268 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3619269 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3619270 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3619271 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3619272 we are in possession of your son we have your daughter we have taken your son we are making him squirm and fidget until he is a detriment to himself and those around him we are destroying his ability for social interaction and driving him into a life of complete isolation its only going to get worse this is only the beginning autism adhd aspergers syndrome ocd bulimia depression
3619273 individuals with disabilities are not replacements for normal children that are stolen away by the disability in question they are whole people deserving of the same rights respect and dignity afforded their peers
3619274 maybe i could fix her this way and in heaven she would be complete said dr
3619275 actually contemplated putting jody her autistic daughter in the car and driving off the georgewashingtonbridge
3619276 its only because of lauren the fact that i have another child that i probably didnt do it
3619277 if i grow up i want to be a fireman
3619278 if you have a question for my husband why dont you ask him yourself

3619287 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3619288 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3619289 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3619290 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3619291 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3619292 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3619293 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3619294 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3619295 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3619296 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3619297 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3619298 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3619299 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3619300 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3619301 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3619302 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3619303 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3619304 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3619305 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3619306 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3619307 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3619308 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3619309 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3619310 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3619311 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3619312 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3619313 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3619314 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3619315 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3619316 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3619317 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3619318 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3619319 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3619320 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3619321 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3619322 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3619323 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3619324 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3619325 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3619326 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3619327 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3619328 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3619329 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3619330 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3619331 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3619332 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3619333 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3619334 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3619335 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3619336 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3619337 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3619338 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3619339 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3619340 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3619341 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3619342 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3619343 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3619344 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3619345 it is better for all the world if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind three generations of imbeciles is enough
3619346 soon it will be a sin for parents to have a child that carries the heavy burden of genetic disease we are entering a world where we have to consider the quality of our children
3619347 in the process of screening donors we select only those that have clean medical backgrounds the embryos that are available have all been medically graded so that the recipient family knows the quality of the embryos that they will be implanting
3619348 it does not seem quite wise to increase any further draining of limited resources by increasing the number of children with impairments
3619349 as i sat in the observers area on the floor of the uns general assembly hall delegates from 80 nations and the european community took their turn at the official signing table to commit their country to the human and civil rights of people with disabilities at several points my eyes welled with tears they should have been tears of joy and pride as an american as a citizen in the country that had created this world wide movement for the rights and empowerment of people with disabilities instead they were tears of shame and embarrassment
3619350 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
3619351 does the eighth amendment permit the execution of a death row inmate who has a factual awareness of the reason for his execution but who because of a severe mental illness has a delusional belief as to why the state is executing him and thus does not appreciate that his execution is intended to seek retribution for his capital crime
3619352 the plane can only handle four im afraid you will have to leave two behind
3619353 the person at the bookstore told me i could return this
3619354 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3619355 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3619356 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3619357 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3619358 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3619359 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3619360 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3619361 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3619362 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3619363 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3619364 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3619365 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3619366 mejor yo no me meto en eso porque puedo equivocarme porque no tengo conocimiento exacto de c mo se ha manejado eso dej moslo as
3619367 en este momento no me siento capaz de tener la visi n clara de todo eso
3619368 un pa s subdesarrollado necesita m s bien que lleguen capitales en vez de exportarlos por qu no se lo entregaron a un fideicomiso del banco nacional y otro al de costa rica
3619369 entiendo el sentido de los obispos cuando vieron que econ micamente lo mejor era invertir con este grupo pero creo que ticamente ha sido el error m s grande que ha cometido la jerarqu a de la iglesia en los ltimos a os porque se han aliado con un grupo y unas personas que desde cualquier punto de vista social que se le juzgue han resultado nefastas para este pa s
3619370 es inconcebible que manejando millones en la conferencia episcopal puedan alegar desconocimiento que otras personas hicieron negocios y ellos no se hab an dado cuenta es una mentira que pocos se pueden tragar
3619371 los bienes de los cristianos seg n el evangelio son un instrumento para hacer caridad dios no quiere templos ni grandes edificios ni grandes fondos de inversi n solo quiere que las personas se quieran entre s y se traten como iguales
3619372 los fondos que recibe la comunidad cristiana para el uso comunitario deben de provenir nicamente de las limosnas de las contribuciones de sus fieles poner dinero a rentar para financiar sus actividades eclesi sticas es un pecado
3619373 porque actualmente se est n dedicando a financiar actividades con las que antes manten an cierta distancia como el foro agrario que se realiz el 28 y 29 de julio esto es una vuelta de la iglesia a la recuperaci n del campesinado es una inversi n grande para este encuentro
3619374 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3619375 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3619376 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3619377 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3619378 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3619379 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3619380 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3619381 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3619382 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3619383 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3619384 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3619385 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3619386 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3619387 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3619388 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3619389 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3619390 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3619391 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3619392 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3619393 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3619394 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3619395 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3619396 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3619397 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3619398 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3619399 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3619400 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3619401 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3619402 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3619403 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3619404 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3619405 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3619406 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3619407 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3619408 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3619409 just so you all know we did set a record
3619410 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3619411 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3619412 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3619413 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3619414 real results by the end of my first term in office
3619415 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3619416 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3619417 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3619418 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3619419 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3619420 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3619421 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3619422 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3619423 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3619424 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
3619425 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3619426 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3619427 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3619428 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

3619445 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3619446 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3619447 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3619448 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3619449 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
3619450 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
3619451 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3619452 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3619453 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3619454 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3619455 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3619456 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3619457 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3619458 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3619459 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3619460 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3619461 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
3619462 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3619463 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3619464 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3619465 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3619466 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3619467 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3619468 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3619469 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3619470 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3619471 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3619472 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3619473 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3619474 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3619475 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3619476 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3619477 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3619478 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3619479 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3619480 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3619481 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that

3619483 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3619484 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3619485 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3619486 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines

3619497 we dont interfere in team selection but you cannot drop players for one bad series by the time the next selection committee is formed the equation might change though
3619498 everything will depend on the form and fitness of the seniors if sachin fails in one series it doesnt mean he will fail in all especially if he is back to full fitness
3619499 test cricket is tough its okay to play juniors in one dayers and twenty20 but its not the same in test cricket we need to groom them like we did with gautam gambhir he is now set if you want to make changes in the test team it has to be a process it cant be done after one bad series we dont work like that anyway
3619500 we have a month and a half to think about how we are going to get to the test series against australia still a lot of time to think and reflect on what went wrong here
3619501 after this series a couple of the seniors will certainly give it a thought about what happened in sri lanka its their call whether to stay and compete or gracefully retire
3619502 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3619503 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3619504 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3619505 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3619506 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3619507 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high

3619513 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3619514 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important

3619518 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3619519 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view

3619521 if something like this is allowed to happen then there will be a worrying situation where many malay institutions will crumble and be malaysia nised

3619524 declaring the du north campus as tobacco free is one of my biggest achievements last month we invited the health minister to our campus and he was very impressed with the whole scenario and supported our campaign whole heartedly
3619525 many students after being fined for smoking in the campus used to come to me and say that this is a habit that they simply cannot give up because they are addicted to smoking that was a clear signal that a rehabilitation centre was what they needed and not just campaigns
3619526 my tenure comes to an end in a few days as re elections will be held sep 5 however whether we stay in power or not care will be taken that privacy of the students who come to the rehab centre will be given top priority the centre will be both media and parents attention proof
3619527 at the college many students take to smoking as a style statement they are dependent on the idea of looking cool for which they smoke not because they are addicted to smoking itself
3619528 although not many student smokers are addicted to smoking they just might be so in future if not helped and since most of them would not like to reveal these things to their parents the assurance that his or her privacy will be maintained is a good thing it is a good step
3619529 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3619530 television watching and using computers appears to have little effect on the development of refractive errors our recently published comparison of age matched chinese children from sydney and singapore showed the same trend
3619531 the results of this study are consistent with an american study which found that outdoor sport was protective however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3619532 it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3619533 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3619534 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal
3619535 while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3619536 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
3619537 he has shown considerable progress he is far better now

3619541 almost half the people who develop these tumours die from them and those who survive often suffer severe side effects from the treatment
3619542 improved treatments are urgently required but in order to develop these we need a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular origins of medulloblastomas
3619543 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3619544 identifying the normal cell that gives rise to a tumour is important because it allows direct comparisons between tumour cells and their normal counterparts so that key differences and vulnerabilities in the tumour can be identified
3619545 also recent studies suggest that cells resembling the original cell may persist in mature tumours and can be critical in ensuring its survival if so these cells would be an excellent target for treatment

3619554 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3619555 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3619556 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3619557 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3619558 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3619559 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3619560 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3619561 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down

3619568 the accc considers that the information to be extracted from the trial has the potential to deliver benefits to the public by assisting governments to determine the most effective way to achieve their goal of reducing plastic bag consumption nationally
3619569 we are confident that every senator and the liberal opposition will want to look closely at the data from the tax office
3619570 that early data shows that there has been an overall reduction in consumption as a result of our measure and that is significant
3619571 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed
3619572 i would invite every senator and i certainly invite the liberal opposition to look where these figures are coming from and which figures are credible and for us to make an assessment on whether this measure in its very early days is already showing some success
3619573 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3619574 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3619575 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3619576 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3619577 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3619578 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3619614 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3619615 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3619616 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3619617 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible

3619632 ada yang menganggap bahwa prabu tajimalela memang benar benar mendapatkan selendang itu dalam arti nyata
3619633 selendang itu sebenarnya bukan hanya diburu kalangan orang orang politik tetapi juga orang orang yang ingin menjadi bupati kepala desa lurah atau pengusaha agar bisnis usahanya laris
3619634 saya menduga selendang itu wujudnya gaib mereka yang mendapatkan selendang itu akan langsung menempel di tubuhnya jadi semacam khodam jin pendamping atau wahyu keprabon

3619914 i was 19 and i really thought about i hadnt done anything for myself i got tired of living the straight up nerd life always doing what my parents wanted me to do or my friends wanted me to do you know everybody elses expectations
3619915 you know people wonder what thought process is going through your head youve got to ask yourself there are people in the world who need help i hate to be cliche the whole be the change thing and im using air quotes because its very cliche but you know are you gonna stand by and just say oh yeah yeah people need help or are you gonna go
3619916 but its really not his personality growing up the last thing i would have expected from him was that he joined the army it kind of surprised us
3619917 billy called me after one of his very first exchanges was it one of the first ones you had i think there had been some fighting and one of the translators was killed but i just remember being in my kitchen and you telling me and thinking i couldnt live in my happy place anymore

3619922 the artistic directors made that decision after consultation with the broadcasters
3619923 the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3619924 instead of being sent press releases by public relations folks im receiving friendly emails and phone calls letting me know about interesting upcoming tidbits of news and increasingly im starting up conversations of a friendly nature that often have very little to do with what sort of new thing their client may be doing its leading to all sorts of beneficial things
3619925 were talking about entire sequences of pages entire web sites designed just for this person
3619926 there are no obvious reasons why the banks wouldnt pass through any change in the cash rate
3619927 funding environment is quite different even in the past few weeks
3619928 the reason this is so significant at present is that customer deposits only account for around 50 per cent of bank funding
3619929 the gap between the cash rate and money market rates is much wider than the historical average and is not showing any sign of easing the new reality is that movements in cash rates set by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding
3619930 the average cost of funds the money that banks have borrowed on domestic and international markets to lend their customers is increasing
3619931 the situation changed over the last couple of weeks with the impact of statements that came out of melbourne with regard to a couple of banks nab anz and their respective positions which has had some impact internationally on the reputation of australian banks and the ability to access international funding markets
3619932 the rba talks to the banks via hotline no doubt and they probably have a good feel as to how the banks will respond given the 50 basis points cut call was largely predicated on the commercial banks not passing anything on the rba can probably stick to 25 basis points in september
3619933 obviously they the rba would like to see the banks fully pass it on whether they do or not is completely up to the banks

3619937 we held two trial matches where akhtar proved his fitness and he is willing to return and since he is determined he is an asset for pakistan
3619938 i am gearing up for the champions trophy after putting the terrible last few months behind me
3619939 his lawyer has argued that akhtar can pay the fine once the appeal against the reduced ban is heard in the court so we have decided to keep the legal matter and cricket separate
3619940 we rested akmal and he too showed improvement in the trial matches so we have included him
3619941 since we would miss yousuf we have included a specialist batsman bazid khan and have also brought in opener khalid latif

3619947 o thy religion of prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practiced or that we leave off doing what we like with our property truly thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right minded
3619948 the truthful and honest merchant is associated with the prophets the upright and the martyrs

3619950 be careful of excessive oaths in a sale though it finds markets it reduces abundance
3619951 the sale is complete when the two involved depart with mutual consent

3619953 you have been entrusted with affairs over which some nations before you were destroyed
3619954 what is lawful is clear and what is unlawful is clear but between them are certain doubtful things which many people do not recognize he who guards against the doubtful things keep his religion and his honor blameless but he who falls into doubtful things falls into what is unlawful just as a shepherd who pastures his flocks round a sanctuary will soon pasture them in it every king has a sanctuary and gods sanctuary is the things he had declared unlawful

3619956 in particular the accc considered that competition in retail banking markets provided by the other major banks and regional banks along with credit unions building societies and niche players would be sufficient to constrain the merged firm after the acquisition
3619957 the accc acknowledges the role that regional banks have played in challenging the major banks particularly as they have entered new states and competed aggressively to gain market share
3619958 the accc considers that the information to be extracted from the trial has the potential to deliver benefits to the public by assisting governments to determine the most effective way to achieve their goal of reducing plastic bag consumption nationally
3619959 i tried to explain to them that i was a british journalist but they would not even let me take out my identification documents they were very rough
3619960 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3619961 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3619962 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3619963 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3619964 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3619965 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3619966 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3619967 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
3619968 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
3619969 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks
3619970 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3619971 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3619972 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3619973 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3619974 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3619975 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3619976 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3619977 we are confident that every senator and the liberal opposition will want to look closely at the data from the tax office
3619978 that early data shows that there has been an overall reduction in consumption as a result of our measure and that is significant
3619979 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed
3619980 although it was a not guilty verdict i have still got a whole lot of re building of my life to do its going to be difficult with such an allegation
3619981 its taken my life away from me and taken everything i had
3619982 you cant look people in the face you think people are talking about you
3619983 theres a horrible stigma with it although you are found not guilty its like it doesnt go away
3619984 i was scared and frightened i was numb and shocked so many things were going through my head
3619985 even in prison it didnt kick in nothing had kicked in
3619986 i wouldnt talk to anyone i wouldnt come out of my cell i was terrified of the unknown
3619987 i lived a normal life i liked living life but now i dont go out
3619988 i dont socialise i only feel safe around my inner circle of family and friends without the closest people to support me through this i dont know how i would have got through it
3619989 i dont look at st albans as my home anymore im a person who needs a routine and needs to feel comfortable with everything in my home homes are meant to be your security and i just didnt feel secure there
3619990 i have to get away from the situation and from where the accusation was made and make a fresh start
3619991 i kept focused for the first four days it was on the last day it started to kick in when i stood up and gave my evidence in court thats when i first broke down from it
3619992 on monday the jury was sent out to come to a verdict and that was very frightening
3619993 i faced five or six years in prison possibly more i wouldnt see my son until he was eight or nine years old i would have missed the most important part of his life
3619994 there and then you suddenly realise whats important to you in life you realise what matters
3619995 life can be taken away from you just like that
3619996 i wasnt scared of being jailed but being convicted of something i knew i did not do
3619997 one thing i will do is tell my son to be wary of contacting any women who have had a drink i would hate for him to go through anything that i have been through
3619998 well assuming i should only pick movies that it would be reasonable to call one of the hundred greatest american movies of those 100 years i think these five
3619999 zanimivo prispevek na pop tv se za ne z izjavama glavnih
