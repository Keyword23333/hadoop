5890006 dear death row inmate 256896 turning a number into a personal connection
5890007 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5890008 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5890009 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5890010 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5890011 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5890012 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5890013 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5890014 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5890015 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward

5890045 its not so much about the content of todays announcement but rather the process here we have another example of the government rolling out a new program without first consulting the people who will be affected the most
5890046 first nations including the nan communities should have been consulted holding a meeting one hour before the announcement as they did in this case is just not going to cut it
5890047 first nation people continue to be over represented as victims of crime as well as in the correctional system in relation to the rest of the population something definitely needs to be done but it needs to be done properly and with consultation with first nations we need to look at the system itself and address what changes need to be made

5890050 we outlasted them because we have a more real atmosphere were a more friendly and inviting place weve got the specialty drinks to like mochas and java carmel but we also have a great selection of teas for people like me im a tea drinker
5890051 were under new ownership and were more popular than weve ever been
5890052 thursday nights are our college nights we have three dollar well drinks then and we easily see over two hundred eighty people and saturdays are just as popular
5890053 we just got a new awning and were not done yet but its still the same place
5890054 but it still is weve got la dolce vita a gay restaurant at six and woodward weve got the gold coast on east seven mile and we have great relationships with all of them weve got the body zone on east mcnichols we sometimes share security with them and its the best in the business
5890055 because detroit always wants to give us permits in bad neighborhoods even with our new owner it was harder this time to have the liquor license passed onto him but overall the city and its inspectors have been very friendly and very courteous weve had no problems with homophobic activity
5890056 lets above all else lets all take care of each other
5890057 im running for president to build an america that lives up to our founding promise of equality for all a promise that extends to our gay brothers and sisters i ask for your support this election so that together we can bring real change for all lgbt americans
5890058 i will place the weight of my administration behind the mathew shepard act to outlaw hate crimes and behind a fully inclusive employment non discrimination act to outlaw workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity
5890059 i personally believe that civil unions represent the best way to secure that equal treatment
5890060 i have also called for us to repeal dont ask dont tell and i have worked to improve the uniting american families act so we can afford same sex couples the same rights and obligations as married couples in our immigration system
5890061 keith boykin former president of the national black justice coalition is our barack obama
5890062 in some capacity i would like to be that person for detroit but one of the problems with that is how much diversity there is within the gay community masculine gay single men masculine gay couples feminine gay single men feminine gay men in relationships and so on feminine versus masculine lesbians transgenders male and female couples singles young people older versus younger hip hop versus house suburbanites versus detroiters
5890063 in fact we may be even more diverse so it would be hard to find
5890064 its another reason im running for detroit city council i want to become the leader for the
5890065 after we passed the resolution calling for president bushs impeachment we distributed it to neighboring cities some of whom drafted their own i know detroit passed two such resolutions and the second one mimicked ours so we think the right people paid attention to it
5890066 people threatened to kill me so the impeachment resolution obviously had an impact one person threatened to hang me by the neck until dead then dance on my grave i notified the f b i but i dont lose any sleep over it its all part of public life
5890067 i cant speak for the lgbt community im not gay but as an elected official of ferndale and as someone whose been involved in politics for the past eight years ferndale does have commitment ceremonies every year during motor city pride we do commitment ceremonies but were not marrying people
5890068 ferndale has been joining gay couples together for five years as mayor ive married three straight couples and im looking forward to joining even more gay couples the commitment ceremonies arent legally binding but theyre as close as we can get in michigan
5890069 i think that was a wedge issue brought up by the right last time around it was definitely a conservative issue then frankly marriage has never been a top priority for the lgbt community
5890070 the gay community needs to finish the issues we started on equal employment government safeguards civil rights protection dont ask dont tell hate crimes protection the war the economy those are gay issues and after suffering through seven years of president bush were ready for someone whos not conservative that is certainly at the top of the list of gay issues
5890071 one thing we may do different is not have a beer tent
5890072 this is a place for young people in crisis young people that need a place of safe transition
5890073 they can do laundry or shower we also have the quiet room for those who need to gel we have something called ruths closet which has clothing they can draw from and we have even more downstairs we have a whole warehouse full of clothing and furniture
5890074 when our transitioners become self sufficient we like to help them furnish their living spaces in a modest and appropriate way
5890075 we have a street outreach program that runs from twelve thirty to nine thirty pm and we have a masters level therapist on duty our single use bathroom and shower were completely designed with the children in mind and they are all invited to come even if its just to be safe or feel comfortable some place they can be themselves
5890076 we get no funding from highland park or from the city of detroit
5890077 though we accept all donations we still have a need for day to day dollars we also ask for non perishable food canned goods shampoo and soap i just wish sometime someone would donate paper towel we consume large amounts of paper products and theyre not reusable
5890078 in fact i was our first volunteer therapist so ive been here a while and the best thing about working here is watching the children need something and us being able to supply it
5890079 we need to create a greater awareness for planned gifts
5890080 were also looking forward to creating a primary care clinic
5890081 but we still need to raise awareness of the center
5890082 every year there are one point three seven million children in america experiencing homelessness forty percent of those are lgbtq questioning thats a huge over representation and up to twenty percent of them experience homelessness because of self identity issues because of who they because of gender orientation alone theyre homeless
5890083 ho perso il mio angelo custode vuoi essere tu adesso
5890084 ecco l io vedo mio padre ecco l io vedo mia madre le mie sorelle e i miei fratelli ecco l io vedo tutti i miei parenti defunti dal principio alla fine ecco ora chiamano me mi invitano a prendere posto in mezzo a loro nella sala del valhalla dove limpavido pu vivere per sempre
5890085 recent demonstrations at fedex field and in the majestic theater show that the two devices used in the demonstrations utterly failed to detect wireless microphones
5890086 after four years of trying the proponents cannot build a device that senses accurately
5890087 specifically the philips device consistently misidentified channel use finding channels occupied that were in fact vacant contrary to the spin by proponents such misidentification demonstrates that sensing does not work the key to sensing is to differentiate between occupied and unoccupied channels the philips device utterly failed in this regard based on this performance the fcc lacks the necessary information to even attempt to draft a rule that will protect consumers
5890088 american consumers who have invested billions of dollars in new digital television sets deserve to have interference free over the air digital television this investment should not be undermined by a few companies simply because they want access to spectrum
5890089 the gradual weakening of the overall magnetic field can take hundreds and even thousands of years but smaller more rapid fluctuations within months may leave satellites unprotected and catch scientists off guard new research finds
5890090 there are these changes in the south atlantic an area where the magnetic field has the smallest envelope at one third of what is normal
5890091 if there are magnetic storms and high energy particles coming from the sun the satellites could be affected and their connections could be lost
5890092 there is a notable sense of denial of how harsh the prospects have been and continue to be for radio
5890093 the classic ceo reply is radio is not bleeding as badly as newspapers we concede there is too little radio ad demand but there is also too little rate card integrity and too little investment in radios product and people for the long term it very much looks to us as all rear guard counter punching

5890100 attached is an rfp sent out yesterday from the set top box subcommittee of the council for research excellence unlike what mr mandese wrote yesterday you can see this is an rfp wherein we are looking for an individual researcher to work with our subcommittee to put together a white paper on the who what when where why of stbs its our hope that the release of the rfp to a few trade outlets will catch the attention of some researchers of whom we may not be aware who will submit proposals
5890101 los reclamos que tienen los pueblos ind genas son derechos amparados no solamente en tratados internacionales de protecci n de pueblos ind genas sino tambi n a nivel constitucional por eso consideramos que los reclamos son leg timos porque muchos de estos decretos legislativos dados por el ejecutivo vulneran los derechos humanos de pueblos ind genas reconocidos en la oit y la misma declaraci n de las naciones unidas sobre pueblos ind genas
5890102 creo que se tendr a primero que serenar los nimos y establecer un di logo y una discusi n sobre lo que significa para ellos el derecho al territorio que no solamente est vinculado a un mero derecho de propiedad sino que va m s all el derecho de territorio para ellos es un derecho inherente para que puedan sobrevivir como individuos y como colectivos
5890103 creo que el gobierno tiene una visi n que se repite en el tiempo descalificar que las propias poblaciones tiene el derecho de reclamar sus derechos sin necesidad de que est alguien detr s de eso por eso debe existir una nueva visi n en la que se reconozca a todas las comunidades ind genas como una riqueza y no como un obst culo para el desarrollo

5890115 wide awake you face the day your dream is over or has it just begun
5890116 tess truehearts that back up this dick tracy thx stacy tracy wink wink gt
5890117 the outraged women of mount isa felt that the mayors comments were archaic and it is totally not the image that we want to project for our city we cant stand for this we need to get out there and say you need to go how dare he embarrass us in this manner
5890118 they will have to do more than call for my resignation i wont be resigning because im quite comfortable with what i said mount isa my city has taken the olympic games off the front page of papers all over australia and the world and ive never heard of that happening before people have supported me everywhere and at the moment i feel like im sitting on the top of mount kosciusko
5890119 theyre certainly serving it up to me their new found cockiness has got some substance to it
5890120 i began to think that there were probably lots of things that i was bad at and i didnt know it
5890121 not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it
5890122 incompetent individuals were less able to recognize competence in others
5890123 in a golf game when your ball is heading into the woods you know youre incompetent
5890124 it is important to note that windows vista shipped a year earlier than windows server 2008 so the client version of windows 7 will have an extra year of development the client in fact will be a major release but as weve said before compatibility with previous versions of windows vista and windows server 2008 is a design goal
5890125 its against policies and procedures to help unless u are a member
5890126 and in any event you havent been in this library ever since you and xander broke up so i feel a moment of surprise and shock is rather in order
5890127 geeze what is it with the people in this town ive heard of lazy winters but this is ridiculous
5890128 right ive been having the same dream for four nights running and it seems to involve almost everyone in sunnydale in some kind of trance and building things and all i need to do is save them is sing but xander starts to make fun of me and i dont and then i wake up everyones down in this big pit building something and the pits somewhere in sunnydale i know it but its nowhere in sunnydale in real life am i making sense
5890129 theres a kind of feel to it like theres something i have to do or itll all go wrong something urging me on and the people in the pit are doing something evil not on purpose you know but its way evil
5890130 but ill do some research to see if i can come up with something fair enough
5890131 no if youre worried ill look it up for you when can you meet me back here
5890132 when are buffy and all the rest not likely to be here
5890133 very well then sixth period it is see you then
5890134 not to my knowledge im just looking up something for erm a friend who has been having dreams she thinks may be significant
5890135 i didnt think there was much to it but i promised her id do a little work on it to ease her fears if nothing else
5890136 i dont like the way you just said now giles
5890137 to my knowledge this is the first time ive actually said it that way
5890138 i think it was the not liking that was important i could be wrong
5890139 i still cant find conclusive proof one way or the other that cordelias dreams meant anything but there are a couple of disturbing coincidences in cordelias dream almost the entire population of sunnydale is in a pit they are all constructing something and she has to sing to save them from the spell they were under
5890140 cordy singing versus being under a spell cordys singing versus being under a spell
5890141 thats right you never heard her sing call you mr lucky
5890142 that calling her attempts at vocalization caterwauling is an insult to felines everywhere now there are records of vaguely similar occurrences in the past right before the vanishings of twenty or so of the best and brightest in the locales near the dreamer but nothing on this scale the trouble is that there is absolutely nothing in here about song of any sort
5890143 i told you once there were two things i didnt believe in coincidence and leprechauns
5890144 okay who put the nasty juice in your cups this morning
5890145 thats even worse news because neither have i and neither i suspect has oz or even you buffy though your slayer strength appears to have you in better shape than the rest of us
5890146 i feel like ive been running marathons every night instead of sleeping
5890147 could the three of you scope this out and see how other people have been sleeping
5890148 and speaking of how people feel how is xander doing
5890149 ick factor times twelve no eating no drinking no nothing
5890150 well i dont believe you only put up with me because of xander well newsflash he betrayed me and we broke up you can quit pretending you like me okay
5890151 if a single speck of that gets in your body youll fall asleep on me
5890152 falling asleep on the job is very serious you should know that
5890153 oh relax im only kidding they dont need weapons not with the teeth they have
5890154 just one thing until tomorrow treat sunnydale like you would any small mexican village
5890155 that unfortunately added to what buffys told me only goes to confirm my suspicions you are indeed having a prophetic dream
5890156 well not until i was clear of all of it not until youd figured out what was going on and told me how to avoid it
5890157 thats the pattern someone notices a problem you figure it out buffy slays and the rest of us arent even involved
5890158 if youre the one having the dream cordelia you will be involved somehow whether you want to be or not
5890159 that there are so many of them we spend on the average one third of our lives in that state so there is no wonder but that makes our task all the harder fortunately many are benign and a few of the rest are dead dormant or otherwise occupied which still leaves us a nice list of several dozen
5890160 everyone seems tired and exhausted and people have been sleepwalking and everything does this help
5890161 that when a crisis comes that xander harris isnt ready for action
5890162 even if i am too weak to turn a page or do anything productive
5890163 then he spent most of the ride whining and moaning in the back seat
5890164 bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum mr xand man bring me a dream
5890165 if we were awake to appreciate that that might almost have been humorous
5890166 wow giles complimenting my sense of humor now i know theres a crisis in sunnydale
5890167 will you be able to stay awake with the rest of us given your condition
5890168 for the last forty eight hours ive done nothing but sleep and something too gross to be mentioned i dont think im going to go to sleep for a week
5890169 that leaves you several steps above the rest of us
5890170 so whats the progress on the research and have you puzzled out the meaning of cordys dream
5890171 ive managed to narrow it down to seven five of whom are demons one of whom is some kind of djinn and the seventh of whom is an ancient greek sorcerer who masqueraded as a god of sleep what we need to do in the next couple of hours is go over the histories of these seven with a proverbial fine tooth comb we have caffeine so that should the events described in cordelias dream come to pass well be awake
5890172 we do have chaff to separate from wheat here so if we could get to it
5890173 okay buffy you can look at yazusi oz you can read up on ghoti willow you can look at the djinn almaghestos and ill handle the remaining three demons
5890174 oh right xander you read up on the greek sorcerer hypnos
5890175 okay lou sorry about that but it looks like everyones getting tired and i think its about time to bring this meeting to a close
5890176 you know something i think thats the most intelligent thing ive ever heard come out of lous mouth
5890177 you keep on the way youre going youre going to have more tea in your veins than blood
5890178 giles buffy everyone come over and take a look at this
5890179 mr mayor trick here yeah shes under got the watcher and a couple of her friends too naah the dork and the bitch aint here but word on the street is hes too sick to do anything and shes not their friend anymore
5890180 anyway ill be sure to keep these four safe and sound on the way over
5890181 okay boys you heard the man much as id like to get rid of some of our troubles right now im afraid its just not in the cards so lets just lay low and at the end of the night hizzoners promised us all a couple of nice juicy children our choice so chop chop people
5890182 youre here youre awake id say you know more about whats going on than i do care to fill me in
5890183 somewhere off behind the main building i didnt see exactly where i was a little preoccupied
5890184 you were coming here to check up on buffy werent you
5890185 if i felt better right now i might make some commentary on how i thought the two of you were trying to stay out of each others lives as much as possible but i really dont have the energy for an argument and besides this isnt the time either
5890186 im never going to stop loving her you realize even if we do move on to other people thats never going to change im sorry if that depresses you
5890187 something you said when you were angelus that that it must just kill me that you got there first and you were right but not in the way you think it never killed me that you slept with her first but that she loved you first
5890188 you hurt me more with that line than with anything else youd ever done you know
5890189 look at this i think this is the dude were up against look at what he tried to do in christchurch not fifty years ago this sounds exactly like cordys dream
5890190 this feels right especially if what you told me about cordelias dream is accurate sound construction everyone under his spell
5890191 well then if we have to stop it we will
5890192 the first thing we should do is find out where all these people are going and maybe then we can try to locate cordelia
5890193 are you going to be up for this xander you look like hell
5890194 oh i do well earlier tonight i looked like shit so im calling that an improvement
5890195 of course im up for it have you ever known me to not be there in a crisis
5890196 okay maybe i caused some of those crises but still
5890197 one more thing buffy said how you tried to help me on christmas so thank you
5890198 just when you thought youve got one of these things beat
5890199 well it makes sense to some extent its a large open space invisible really to anyone standing outside
5890200 in the dream she was standing at the edge of a cliff and looking down so maybe she was standing in the top row of the stadium
5890201 tell me something giles said cordelia was having the dreams because she was the key to stopping hypnos right
5890202 then look over there and tell me were not in trouble
5890203 thats right vampire look all you want but dont touch
5890204 nothing you need to worry about my vampire friend my spells dont affect the undead
5890205 she still has her slaying abilities did you know that vampire these people have all the skills asleep that they did awake
5890206 none i can see the slayers as hard at work as everyone else and no one else around seems inclined to get in the way of the sleepwalking army here reports are a few people peering out windows and thats about it
5890207 out of town girl takes irresponsibility to a whole new level
5890208 one thing ive learned about dear sweet old sunnydale is that theres always a possibility of something going wrong
5890209 i believe its a method hypnos is going to use to gain greater power over the sleepwalkers but he didnt share any more than that why do you ask
5890210 and i dont believe you have a need to live
5890211 i just want to know if its going to cause me any future grief thats all
5890212 doing the work of ten of them what a wonder shed be in the construction business
5890213 look your honor i think youre one of those people who doesnt even let his right wrist know what his right hands doing no i dont think youd tell me
5890214 but in this case i really dont know anything more you could always ask hypnos
5890215 we might be in better shape if you didnt go out of your way to tell the enemy where we were
5890216 its not like i dont basically share your opinion at the moment
5890217 you were saying something about not letting the enemy know where we were
5890218 hypnos controls all of these people at once but he doesnt look through all of them at once and id say hes probably more interested in whats going on inside his stadium right now than he is in those straggling in
5890219 and would you suggest we go charging in blindly we need cordelia to solve this and right now shes not much good for solving anything so research boy
5890220 and im hardly in shape to charge a few thousand sleepwalkers
5890221 i dont care if youre one of the good guys again or not youd better have a damned good reason for this
5890222 youll sue him sorry to break the news to you cordy but all your daddys high priced lawyers dont mean jack where deadboy heres concerned which youd know if you had more than a few puffs of cotton keeping your ears from slamming into each other
5890223 sorry if you dont like the way im talking to you princess paragon but i havent eaten solid food in two days theres a horde of sleepwalkers building the key to supermans fortress of solitude inside our football stadium and you who might just be the difference between whether we succeed or fail you go falling merrily off to sleep
5890224 youre one to talk about not doing what you were told to do falling asleep on oz like that falling all over willow like that i may not be perfect but im a hell of a lot closer than you are
5890225 tomorrow maybe ill feel all guilty again but right now
5890226 cordelia short version your dreams are beginning to come true and everyone in the town has fallen asleep now then xander didnt you tell me youd tried to wake everyone up when they fell asleep
5890227 yeah even dumped a soda on buffys head but nothing happened
5890228 and i saw two people crash into a wall outside and they didnt wake up either
5890229 my point is cordelia woke up you never fell asleep why
5890230 back to the library cordelia i think you can walk the rest of the way
5890231 hold it no way im going to be running around the schools at night in my nightgown i mean you two might be used to running around in your underwear but im not
5890232 were not going back to your house cordelia i dont care how embarrassed you are
5890233 embarrassed hardly just that wormboy over theres long since lost his rights to see me wearing a nightgown and you blew your chance a long time ago
5890234 easier just to take her down to the locker room and get her gym clothes than to argue trust me on this one ill head off to the library and see what else is in that book if you ever tell giles this ill kill well okay ill get really mad but its actually a kind of fun read
5890235 well its either him or you and while i dont trust you i dont like him
5890236 you know ive always wanted to say evil bidding and mean it
5890237 unfortunately i think the other way is the way were going to have to go
5890238 problem is wed have to let hypno dude complete his little symbol odoom
5890239 the symbol produces a sound that keeps everyone under his control and permanently asleep but a certain tone can disrupt it if sung with emotion guess thats where you come in cordelia
5890240 it needs a bad singer cordelia a very very bad singer
5890241 speaking as one who is forever traumatized by cordelias rendition of greatest love of all may i just say the gods could not have made a better choice
5890242 shut up benedict harris you shacked up with your best friend and got me spiked through the stomach who the hell gave you the right to an opinion
5890243 i knew it was a good idea to have someone scope out this place
5890244 get up we have to run out the back door now they know were here
5890245 not far that entrance and up a flight of stairs
5890246 this is why were here xander this way cordelias voice will be heard throughout the stadium
5890247 dont know why the three of you bolted up there not going to do you any good though because the pattern is
5890248 the pattern is done still cant do with any loose ends
5890249 nows your chance to have a captive audience go ahead and afflict them with your voice
5890250 something you never got to find out about me when i get really sick or really tired beyond being sick and tired of your whining which i am i tend to lose all of my defense mechanisms all those things that keep me from spouting the truth when i get really annoyed
5890251 and i just thought you should know that cause you are not going to like what i say next and i wanted to get my excuse out of the way
5890252 here you are you finally have a chance to save the world to do the right thing and all you can think about is your own fears ive had fears angels had fears get over them dammit
5890253 look at them cordy theyre going through hell right now but you know what you know what id rather let them stay in hell
5890254 thanks for all your help the symbols almost completed incidentally you might want to move around a bit like youre under the spell you have a couple of interlopers holing up in the announcers booth
5890255 dont have a clear view of you but still better safe
5890256 you may be interested i got a clear view of both miss cordelia chase and the traitor vamp angel
5890257 shouldnt you go do something about them then what do we pay you for anyway
5890258 near as i can tell to stand around a lot and try to come up with a good reason why i shouldnt separate your head from your neck and drink the blood comes pouring out
5890259 mr tricks services will not be necessary i can handle the barricade and theres little they can do trapped up there
5890260 by the way mr trick here you two do know each other right
5890261 well he started me wondering whats this symbol going to do
5890262 trick remind me to listen to you in the future
5890263 hypnos what am i going to do in control of a town full of sleepwalkers
5890264 will stay right where he is you have no cause for complaint mayor i helped get you elected you owed me a favor you did it what you do afterwards is none of my concern
5890265 the old you scratch my back i stab yours routine i like your style
5890266 didnt say i agreed with the application just said i liked his style
5890267 hard way easy way your call mayor wilkins either drink the water or i can just hit you over the head
5890268 you know what id rather let them stay in hell
5890269 who the hell are you to tell me i cant sing just you watch me xander and then tell me i cant sing
5890270 that maneuver you pulled on cordelia to get her angry well played
5890271 i dont know why i keep doing that not like ive had anything to eat in the last two days
5890272 cordelias on some kind of freaky diet i dont know what shes eating but shes not drinking the water
5890273 good now heres what good i think the book can do
5890274 you cant see whats going on out there but i can you hear that song she keeps singing and stopping
5890275 im wondering how i can get her to sing the rest of the song
5890276 im not used to my plans working once i certainly dont want to tempt fate by trying it again
5890277 im not even close to giles level of ability when it comes to doing research
5890278 im sure that somewhere in that book theres a spell of some sort that would be even better but right now were kind of pressed for time
5890279 i do research i fight though im not great at either of them but spellcasting is way out of my league
5890280 xander you picked a poor time to have an identity crisis read the spell and cast it
5890281 when youre ready tap cordelia on the shoulder ill try to figure out why she cant finish the song in question read the spell through the microphone and let me know what happens
5890282 i need to read a spell and angel wants to talk to you
5890283 whose brilliant idea was this this is so not what we need everyone in love with you again
5890284 i know i need to sing it but i cant i cant i just cant
5890285 because look i need to sing these songs with emotion and all of them have a lot i can sing straight out but this one this ones almost perfect except for the last two lines
5890286 i i i still dont blame you for leaving baby its cold living with ghosts
5890287 but it was all his fault i do blame him for leaving me i didnt cheat on him i didnt make out with my best friend i didnt drive a spike through my own stomach
5890288 im assuming by your silence that you didnt tell him so tell me this cordelia do you think things might have been different if you had told him
5890289 was there any reaction when you finished chanting the spell
5890290 i was hoping everyone would wake up and this would all be over the symbol must be too strong still if you chanted it right it should have some effect
5890291 as long as it takes cordelia to finish singing or sunrise whichever comes first
5890292 tell me do you know the number of a good chiropractor
5890293 thhhissss iiiss aaaa dreeeaaamm goooo hooomme annnddd gggett in bbedd
5890294 oz giles willow man ive never been happier to see any of you wake up before in my life um not that ive seen willow wake up anytime recently
5890295 i assume one of you is going to tell us what happened
5890296 the long version would take a while lets just wait until were all safe and weve found buffy
5890297 i do not make it a habit to memorize such spells and though your prowess in the area is growing rapidly i must have doubts in your ability to come up with something that would on the spur of the moment defeat the spells of a two thousand year old magician especially given your condition at the moment
5890298 and where would you suggest we get this book xander
5890299 xander some day you are going to have to tell me how you did that
5890300 angel took it from the library and during a little break in the action i read a spell out of it to help us wake people up
5890301 now if it was the wrong one blame deadboy not me
5890302 though it wasnt perfect for the circumstances it was indeed appropriate
5890303 this one however is a bit more specific to the moment willow do you concur
5890304 yes if anything will wake buffy up right now this will
5890305 buffy is still asleep possessed by the sorcerer and shes trying to kill angel for ruining his plans
5890306 but i was the one who did the singing me why is he getting all the credit
5890307 that that was your voice we heard as we were waking up
5890308 astonishment later willow are you prepared to do the incantation
5890309 hey hypnos i was the one who ruined your pathetic plan thats right pathetic i mean shouldnt a two thousand year old magician be able to fight back against one girl
5890310 now which one of you is going to take me home
5890311 i mean come on its not like i want to hang around with you people any longer than i absolutely have to
5890312 i i had assumed cordelia that your actions of the last twenty four hours bespoke otherwise
5890313 come on back to the scooby gang you know you want to
5890314 want to look i dont know how it is with you people but i dont need anyone elses approval and i dont need to be with anyone to make myself feel good thats one thing you people taught me you cant trust anyone least of all one of you
5890315 no mr trick though that is everyones civic duty and not a problem to be ignored no what i hate the most is betrayal
5890316 i know you wouldnt betray me youre too smart for that
5890317 i am a little disappointed in your performance though do you know how personally embarrassed i am that i had to be rescued by the chase girl
5890318 suicide wasnt part of the bargain your honor if id tried anything right then the sunnydale high janitors would be sweeping me and my people out of the stands right about now and you knew i wasnt big on personal risks when you recruited me
5890319 you knew the job was dangerous when you took it
5890320 still i guess no harm no foul and i was more to blame than you were for not suspecting hypnos motives sooner
5890321 besides the sorcerer was the one who betrayed me and you know how i feel about betrayal
5890322 and i want you to have one of your people ready to deliver it
5890323 i mean its been two thousand years youd think someone would have tried this before
5890324 hypnos was always a genius at concealing his actual location
5890325 and besides hes never had to be particularly near those over whom he exercises his influence and it is only that one phrase that can harm him are you ready
5890326 after what this bastard did to you all me and angel oh yeah im ready
5890327 it is too early to discuss specific features capabilities or timing
5890328 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5890329 we are on the clock we have 16 and a half months before we run into a 21 percent clip in reimbursements the punch line is that to continue to have influence in the process we have to work together

5890373 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5890374 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5890375 well just try to match up the best way we can
5890376 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out

5890403 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5890404 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5890405 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5890406 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that

5890446 social network users need to realise that the information and photos they put into cyberspace in some cases can be seen by others and can leave a digital tattoo that can be difficult to erase
5890447 the latest research from the us suggests 44 per cent of employers are now using sites like myspace and facebook to research job candidates

5890500 we have loved our time in downtown palo alto and consider it part of the dna here at facebook
5890501 many of our employees live in the area and will continue to be a part of the downtown community
5890502 it has been another outstanding day and a great gold medal on the track by christine who ran a fantastic race
5890503 you never think its a reality its something you dream about as i came across the line i thought oh my gosh i dont know what to say
5890504 it just feels unbelievable its going to take a while to sink in but wow
5890505 it doesnt feel real yet im so glad im part of it
5890506 i was vaguely aware of the history people tell you about it but i tried to make it the furthest thought from my mind
5890507 and thats why the emotions come out at the end you bottle it for so long that it just erupts at the end
5890508 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
5890509 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
5890510 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
5890511 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
5890512 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5890513 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5890514 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5890515 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
5890516 few interventions have been proved to substantially help patients with chronic back pain in the longer term
5890517 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination the practice and theory of the technique support the hypothesis that it could potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
5890518 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5890519 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5890520 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5890521 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5890522 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5890523 blood and marrow transplantation from unrelated donors has been routinely utilized to treat treatment refractory leukemia and lymphoma for almost two decades
5890524 preliminary results from the few unrelated donor transplants that have been performed for other non malignant conditions show great promise for those who suffer a severely diminished quality of life due to sickle cell disease participants in this large scale study will help us understand how to better treat and possibly even cure sickle cell disease for more people
5890525 maybe were not here i have no idea id like to have that opportunity to make that decision ive been asked that question a lot the answer is i dont know
5890526 we kind of turned it loose today we did good on a couple we didnt do quite as well on other ones the good thing is it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections i dont think were even close yet i dont say that in a negative way i think were making strides for me it gets worse before it gets better
5890527 with every preseason game ive played in id love to play the whole game if im going to come out here and practice id love to play in the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it whatever eric mangini wants to do we havent really talked about it youd like to go in and play like the other night maybe get some more plays and be as successful but what if youre not do you keep trying to gain that success and in the process something bad happens i dont know i think its kind of a touchy situation based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
5890528 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5890529 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5890530 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5890531 this was sent to me and i forwarded it to maybe 20 people
5890532 family members and i thought friends it was obviously sent to a political enemy
5890533 once immigrants to australia are done complaining whining and griping about our flag our pledge our christian beliefs or our way of life i highly encourage you take advantage of one other great australian freedom the right to leave
5890534 i believe in america and the american way of life i dont believe americans should allow sharia law to be practiced in this country
5890535 swift wants to see that this statement is made aware to our brother paul ruff that his is the lone voice that we know of in this in our community
5890536 i have many muslim friends and i cherish their friendships perhaps we need more experience with one another
5890537 i dont think that he understands muslims or the constitution
5890538 im not looking for an apology i just want to sit down and hear where hes coming from
5890539 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
5890540 ive been at national city for 30 years and a month and for 29 of those weve seen nothing like it
5890541 in past cycles certainly lending or credit has gotten more difficult the cost of credit would go up in this particular phenomenon of the last year its not like you can borrow money and the price went up no the markets closed
5890542 we will have more tomorrow as this has not yet been made official but it appears the december 5th ufc will be taking place at the bell center in montreal with george st pierre headlining
5890543 what in the world am i doing i dont know these people they dont know me
5890544 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
5890545 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5890546 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic
5890547 it was nice you know i just realized that this is the first time youve ever treated me for lunch or am i exaggerating
5890548 not quite i mean i know ive been working for the paper for about a year but this is probably the first time that both of us have been available to have lunch together for a long time
5890549 piper this has nothing to do with jason even if he had been available for lun i mean
5890550 ah ha nothing yes jason was busy today but i had already invited you to lunch before i found out about his overseas phone conference
5890551 thats our new food columnist portia something italian she had an interview with bruce today
5890552 strange ive never really met her yet maybe i should introduce myself
5890553 oh no it is one twenty and my doctors appointment was for one thirty it is too late i will have to cancel
5890554 i mean well if you must perhaps i should have dropped you off first
5890555 your fianc es shop was closer it was better that we took her to her shop first as for my doctors appointment i can re schedule
5890556 actually piper and i had just came back from lunch
5890557 weve havent met but i know who you are im phoebe halliwell
5890558 the bay mirror im a columnist there you know the ask phoebe column
5890559 im sorry but i am not familiar with your writing
5890560 i have not been with the newspaper very long or in san francisco
5890561 please signor give me a call so that we can complete the interview that is the number to my office as for my private number
5890562 im afraid that i have not installed a telephone in my apartment yet
5890563 theres a coffee shop inside the building that makes a nice cappuccino
5890564 im really beginning to think that cole was right about her
5890565 and as for miss della scalla you might be right about her being odd the woman looks like something out of a european fashion magazine you know ridiculously beautiful and thin
5890566 but theres something else like theres something unreal about her and did you notice how bruce was acting around her like he was in some kind of trance or something
5890567 phoebe has this something to do with the fact that ms della scalla had turned down your offer for a friendly cup of cappuccino
5890568 you know if you werent so busy gloating over the possibility that bruce might be fooling around you might have noticed something
5890569 yeah i noticed something all right bruce and miss italy were seconds away from kissing each other
5890570 they were geez no wonder barbara looked as if she wanted to commit murder
5890571 it was just as phoebe had said he seemed to be in a trance or like he really didnt care how barbara was feeling
5890572 thats ridiculous pheebs unless this della scalla woman is a warlock a witch or a demon and if shes after bruce why kill dewolfe mann
5890573 well how else could she get close to him she could have used the interview as an excuse or get a job at the golden horn
5890574 okay piper then explain why cole olivia and darryl are all suspicious of her
5890575 i dont know phoebe but werent you the one who claimed that a man must have killed your friend wolfie you said that you saw a mans hand slit his throat
5890576 i know its just i dont know ive got a bad feeling about her
5890577 in case she turns out to be a demon or a warlock i dont have time at the moment because i have to get ready
5890578 to celebrate his birthday he wants to go to this new club in palo alto
5890579 have fun meanwhile piper and i will check the book of shadows
5890580 and tomorrow ill keep an eye on miss della scalla maybe borrow something from her office while shes out to lunch hopefully summon a premonition
5890581 okay can you please explain again why bruce mcneill isnt dead
5890582 we were alone for twelve minutes nicholas while he was driving
5890583 unfortunately no you failed to mention that his mother would also be interviewed
5890584 mind you meeting the famous gweneth mcneill was something of a thrill she has quite a reputation in europe you know however another visitor decided to join us during the interview
5890585 his fianc e what a possessive bitch and i think shes very suspicious
5890586 barbara is not a bitch besides what was she doing there in the first place
5890587 how would i know i am not a mind reader bruce must have said something to arouse her suspicions before the interview she seemed to be seeking me out when she first arrived
5890588 i did have a chance to cast a spell over bruce and bring him here unfortunately these two sisters interrupted us one of them works for the newspaper
5890589 as for this signorina halliwell do you know her and her sister
5890590 she has two sisters well she had three but the oldest was killed by a daemon nearly two years ago as for phoebe she and one of her sisters were outside manns apartment that night remember me telling you about the charmed ones three sisters who happened to be the most powerful witches
5890591 i believe i had met the third sister at that shop her hair was dyed red
5890592 the charmed ones the power of three they are supposed to be three sisters descended from the warren line destined to be the most powerful witches ever
5890593 theyre the wiccan counterparts to the cavalli family more powerful than the mcneills well just barely
5890594 powerful or not they are not invincible do not worry about these charmed ones i have come across more powerful opponents
5890595 belthazor otherwise known as cole turner i believe that you had met him at the bay mirror office yesterday he was dewolfe manns attorney according to paige
5890596 are you referring to that tall handsome man with the dark hair and blue eyes what about him
5890597 that tall and handsome man happens to be a very powerful half daemon
5890598 its essentially being marketed as a place where african american males or someone who dresses like that is not welcome
5890599 as a company we are working to make sure we are inclusive to everyone
5890600 if they have any issue thats important to them they keep track of it they have someone who makes it happen i didnt hear any of that today
5890601 a lot of that is ongoing we work all the time on that and you see it in the numbers
5890602 i wouldnt go that far but i am not surprised if a black man feels like its somebody elses district
5890603 mookie it was the combination first of all the whole style that you have going on just the blend of the rock the soul the pop plus all of that back phrasing you were doing just one great big jumbo pot of mmm mmm good
5890604 i dont know how many people really know that song was actually taken from an old blues song and i knew you would figure that out or i had a feeling you would and you really captured the old blues soul funk of that thing and to be honest i think that you can get really carried away sitting here but i think that was the best version of that song ive ever heard

5890623 this is like the ultimate youve got striking youve got grappling youve got weapons anything goes

5890639 it appeared to me and to a number of other people ive spoken to that anglos and particularly americans have always felt a bit underrepresented here and so the coalition will be made up of a number of constituent organizations is to form something of a bloc to represent what we believe are the most prevalent positions that americans living in israel would take

5890677 i cant imagine even imagine what his mothers going through
5890678 it doesnt matter if you lost your son in the city or across the world its still the same painful experience
5890679 polls do indicate that the next election is in all likelihood a minority one way or the other
5890680 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government needs a new mandate
5890681 i will assess it this fall we are during the summer and there are byelections to win
5890682 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5890683 they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date
5890684 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
5890685 and today he said that this government is so terrible that it should be removed from office at any time hes just not sure when
5890686 harpers telling you hes not going to wait for an election
5890687 the liberals have been rolling over on their backs like kitties saying pet me
5890688 so we havent seen any disruption weve seen a government hell bent on having an election and has been hell bent on it for quite a while
5890689 it looks to me like hes been able to get virtually everything through with the help of the liberals
5890690 if i realize that stephen harper has the intention to go ahead with a right wing agenda that is not good for quebec the bloc quebecois will use its first opposition day to table a non confidence motion
5890691 det angel gna i att helt genomf ra sex punktsavtalet om eldupph r som sl ts den 12 augusti i moskva
5890692 we go on because it is the hard thing to do and we owe ourselves the difficulty
5890693 our goal is medals not just to show up and be good canadians its a change in the paradigm its a culture shift why not be the first ones to get out and do it and make everyone react to us
5890694 i believe its the evolution of our sport and youre going to see more and more countries do it and it worked spectacularly today mr jenkins was spectacular today the communication was spectacular
5890695 it took courage to say that we wanted to do this and we took criticism
5890696 i didnt really care about the rest of my race i actually stopped and yelled at simon as he ran by it was so exciting
5890697 its evolving into a team sport a medal for the country come on what more can you ask for seriously
5890698 i think theres going to be a lot of dissension with all this
5890699 if the goal is to get a gold medal and thats where olympics have gone yeah this is a great move i got into the sport for the individual thing but as soon as you allow drafting that changes the playing field completely
5890700 i think paul has always made it abundantly clear hes not crazy about this whole thing and i can see where hes coming from
5890701 we wanted him to be a part of the team and his heart really wasnt in it it didnt appear that he was really buying into the process because while i dont believe its controversial its not a guarantee
5890702 what were now going to start seeing more and more in the sport is people who are swim bike specialists whose sole job is to get a fast runner to the finish line or to the start of the run in the best possible shape its absolutely no different than the tour de france the domestiques hauling their team leaders and making sure everythings taken care of until the big sprint
5890703 if youre going to charge a person with terrorism that person has typically or traditionally not been a soldier or enemy combatant there is ample evidence of his intention to be a frontline soldier in afghanistan
5890704 the training was clearly for the kind of jihadi involved in frontline battle
5890705 not a day goes by that i do not wish to be with the mujahedeen in the frontlines of jihad
5890706 common unlawful design or in this case as expressed in the counts on the indictment is violent jihad wheresoever it might ultimately be committed
5890707 the state then goes on to alleged involvement in a different place to be a frontline jihadi soldier in afghanistan the crown should not be able to shift its case and what the crown has shifted its case to is not a criminal offence i submit
5890708 does not include an act or omission that is committed during an armed conflict and that at the time and in the place of its commission is in accordance with customary international law or conventional international law applicable to the conflict or the activities undertaken by military forces of a state in the exercise of their official duties to the extent that those activities are governed by other rules of international law
5890709 youre wearing im with stupid it must be tuesday again
5890710 always felt like half a person half a person with half a soul sometimes if she dreamed hard enough she could put the two halves together
5890711 as neither kittery nor wells ogunquit is in an approved configuration i believe there is an opportunity for the two school systems to explore combining central offices sharing resources and administering functions such as special education transportation facilities and maintenance from a single office through an rsu regional school unit or an aos alternative organizational structure
5890712 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together
5890713 i have a real issue with this because the commissioner is forcing this on us and it wont save any money
5890714 i cant see spending anymore time on this its not helping education its hurting it
5890715 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
5890716 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
5890717 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
5890718 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has
5890719 if the focus is on the money side it should have been kept on the money side
5890720 wells size allows them to be their own rsu or to be exempt from the consolidation requirement
5890721 im concerned that two weeks after the wells ogunquit combination falls through well get this same letter with another districts name in it
5890722 so it seems youve been having a bit of a problem getting in in the morning
5890723 im a few minutes late sometimes i didnt think it was a big deal since everyone is standing around talking about sports when i get here and i dont care about sports so i start working right away

5890725 what half the time i beat michael in and he only lives a couple blocks away i live 18 miles away
5890726 hey michael scott works very hard he has earned the right to come in whenever he wants
5890727 im positive if i had ordered new services would you not be able to see that in your system
5890728 oh yes maam you are correct so i am going to credit you 8 27
5890729 i understand your concerns if you dont mind remaining calm and holding for a few more moments i will further research this issue
5890730 mam thank you for holding first may i call you by your first name

5890763 in a place like montana there simply werent the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non election years and so it was very difficult
5890764 it kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates maintaining voter files making sure we have county committees that are working and organised
5890765 the government not telling you how to live your life and what to do
5890766 it taught me about rejection from a really early stage

5890787 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting
5890788 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5890789 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5890790 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves

5890907 kami sediakan bagi hamba hamba ku yang shalih sesuatu yang tak pernah terlihat oleh mata tak pernah terdengar oleh telinga dan tak pernah terlintas oleh hati manusia
5890908 seorang pun tak mengetahui apa yang disembunyikan untuk mereka yaitu
5890909 sesungguhnya jika salah seorang dari kalian meninggal dunia maka kursinya diperlihatkan kepadanya setiap pagi dan petang jika ia penghuni surga maka ia adalah penghuni surga jika ia penghuni neraka maka ia adalah penghuni neraka kemudian dikatakan inilah kursimu hingga allah taala membangkitkanmu pada hari kiamat nanti
5890910 jibril berjalan terus hingga tiba di sidratul muntaha dan ternyata sidratul muntaha ditutup dengan warna yang tidak aku ketahui
5890911 kemudian aku masuk ke dalam surga dan ternyata di dalamnya terdapat kubah dari mutiara dan tanahnya beraroma kesturi
5890912 dan orang orang yang bertaqwa kepada rabbnya dibawa ke dalam surga berombong rombongan
5890913 kesejahteraan dilimpahkan atas kalian berbahagialah kalian maka masukilah surga ini sedang kalian kekal di dalamnya
5890914 yaitu surga aden yang pintu pintunya terbuka bagi mereka di dalamnya mereka bertelekan di atas dipan dipan sambil meminta buah buahan yang banyak dan minuman di surga tersebut
5890915 di surga terdapat delapan pintu ada pintu yang namanya ar rayyan yang hanya dimasuki oleh orang orang yang puasa
5890916 barang siapa yang berinfak dengan sepasang unta atau kuda atau lainnya di jalan allah swt
5890917 siapa di antara kalian yang berwudhu kemudian menyempurnakan wudhunya lalu membaca asyhadu an laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahulaa syarikalahu wa asyhadu anna muhammadan abduhu warasuluhu maka dibukakan baginya pintu pintu surga yang berjumlah delapan dan ia masuk dari mana saja yang ia sukai
5890918 jika seorang muslim mempunyai tiga orang anak yang belum baligh kemudian meninggal dunia maka mereka menjumpainya di pintu pintu surga yang delapan dan ia bebas masuk dari pintu mana saja yang ia sukai
5890919 demi muhammad yang jiwanya ada di tangan nya jarak antara dua daun pintu surga adalah seperti makkah dan hajar atau hajar dan makkah
5890920 kalian adalah penyempurna tujuh puluh umat kalian adalah umat yang terbaik dan termulia di sisi allah jarak di antara dua daun pintu surga adalah empat puluh tahun pada suatu hari ia akan penuh sesak
5890921 pintu yang dimasuki oleh penghuni surga jaraknya adalah sejauh perjalanan pengembara dunia yang ahli tiga kali lipat kemudian penghuni surga memenuhinya hingga pundak mereka nyaris lengkap
5890922 pergilah dan ucapkan salam kepada sekumpulan tersebut mereka adalah para malaikat yang sedang duduk duduk dan mendengarkan salam yang mereka sampaikan kepadamu karena salam tersebut adalah salammu dan salam anak keturunanmu
5890923 maka setiap orang yang masuk ke dalam surga wajahnya seperti wajah adam dan postur tubuhnya adalah enam puluh hasta setelah adam manusia mengecil hingga sekarang
5890924 penghuni surga masuk ke dalam surga dengan rambut pendek belum berjenggot matanya bercelak dan usianya tiga puluh tiga tahun
5890925 jika penghuni surga meninggal dunia baik pada saat kecil atau tua maka mereka dikembalikan dengan usia tiga puluh tahun di surga dan usianya tidak bertambah selama lamanya begitu juga penghuni neraka
5890926 penghuni surga masuk surga dengan ketinggian adam enam puluh hasta dengan ukuran orang besar dengan wajah tampan setampan nabi yusuf seusia nabi isa tiga puluh tiga tahun lidahnya fasih sefasih nabi muhammad belum berjenggot dan berambut pendek
5890927 sesungguhnya derajat penghuni surga yang paling rendah yang berada di tingkat keenam dan ketujuh disediakan baginya tiga ratus pelayan yang setiap pagi dan sore melayaninya dengan memberikan tiga ratus piring yang saya ketahui piring tersebut terbuat dari emas
5890928 setiap piring mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh piring yang lain ia menikmati dari piring yang pertama hingga piring terakhir pelayan pelayan juga memberikan tiga ratus minuman di mana setiap minuman mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh tempat minum yang lain ia menikmati tempat minum pertama hingga tempat minum terakhir
5890929 sesungguhnya ia mempunyai istri sebanyak tujuh puluh dua orang yang berasal dari wanita wanita surgawi yang matanya cantik jelita belum temasuk istri istrinya dari wanita dunia
5890930 dan penghuni surga yang paling tinggi atau mulia di sisi allah adalah orang yang melihat wajah allah setiap pagi dan petang
5890931 wajah wajah orang orang mukmin pada saat itu berseri seri kepada rabbnyalah mereka melihat
5890932 saya memang diperintah agar pintu surga ini tidak saya buka sebelum anda terlebih dulu masuk
5890933 jibril datang kepada saya dan memberi informasi tentang pintu surga yang akan dimasuki oleh umatku
5890934 ya rasulullah saw aku ingin bersamamu hingga dapat melihat pintu surga
5890935 engkau wahai abu bakar adalah orang pertama dari umatku yang memasuki surga
5890936 mereka berbaris dalam satu regu wajah mereka memancarkan kepuasan seperti rembulan saat pertama tubuh mereka bersih dari kotoran tidak meludah tidak berdahak dan tidak pula buang air tempat tempat singgahnya terbuat dari emas sisirnya terbuat juga dari emas dan perak tempat apinya adalah kayud keringatnya berupa minyak misyk setiap lelaki memiliki pasangan istri yang kulitnya cemerlang seolah olah sumsumnya tampak dari balik daging mereka tidak pernah berselisih tidak saling membenci sebab mereka sehati bacaannya tiap kali adalah tasbih setiap pagi maupun sore
5890937 pasti masuk surga di antara umatku yang berjumlah tujuh puluh ribu orang tanpa hisab atau tujuh ratus ribu orang mereka saling bergandeng hingga masuk surga semuanya wajah mereka seperti rembulan pada saat pertama
5890938 semua umat diperlihatkan kepadaku kemudian aku lihat ada nabi yang diikuti oleh sekelompok orang pengikutnya
5890939 ini adalah umatmu dan di antara mereka ada tujuh puluh ribu orang yang masuk surga tanpa dihisab dan disiksa setelah itu rasulullah masuk ke dalam rumah
5890940 sementara orang orang sibuk membicarakan siapa sebenarnya mereka yang masuk ke dalam surga tanpa hisab dan tanpa disiksa sebagian mereka berkata
5890941 barangkali mereka adalah yang dilahirkan dalam keadaan islam dan tidak menyekutukan allah dengan sesuatupun
5890942 berdoalah kepada allah agar ia menjadikan aku di antara mereka
5890943 aku tahu orang terakhir yang ke luar dari neraka dan terakhir masuk surga ia ke luar dari neraka sambil merangkak lalu allah berfirman kepadanya
5890944 pergilah dan masuklah ke dalam surga sebab di sana tidak seperti di dunia melainkan sepuluh kali dunia
5890945 apakah engkau ejek aku atau engkau tertawakan aku sedang engkau adalah raja
5890946 apakah engkau masih ingat setiap orang berada di rumahnya sendiri sendiri

5890948 nearest among the believers are the ones who say we are christians
5890949 i certainly think that for this to happen at this stage in our history to see what someone does in our community makes me very very disappointed
5890950 and very angry that they would display racial bias the way they did
5890951 were from jamaica and we read about racial issues but we somehow associated the northern part of the u s with people who are more diverse more open to diversity so to see something like this leaves us disappointed
5890952 ma guarda che io non sono come loro li frequento solo perch siamo vicini di casa nientaltro io sono al di sopra di loro sono il tuo uomo ideale
5890953 io e te siamo uguali io non sono come loro
5890954 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
5890955 i find it horribly ironic and paradoxical that at the same time we are struggling with energy independence that the congress and the current administration cant solve this issue
5890956 a sensible coordination of all political and military elements of the afghan theatre of operation does not exist

5890966 en toen liet meneer duchateau een aantal slides zien gemaakt door zijn medewerkers geanalyseerd door zijn medewerkers voorzien van arumenten door zijn medewerkers en herhaalde hij voor een publiek wat zijn medewerkers hadden onderzocht
5890967 dit ligt in de lijn met het beleid van de vennootschap sinds 1956 het jaar waarin het huidige sofina werd opgericht om een van jaar tot jaar regelmatig stijgend dividend voor te stellen
5890968 she could afford to be a little more magnanimous and a little less of a cunt
5890969 i would like to tell you of the benefits of that plain little old bottle of 3 peroxide you can get for under 1 00 at any drug store my husband has been in the medical field for over 36 years and most doctors dont tell you about peroxide or they would lose thousands of dollars
5890970 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
5890971 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5890972 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5890973 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5890974 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5890975 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5890976 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5890977 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5890978 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5890979 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
5890980 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis

5890996 so at that time deschutes county might be looking at possibly adopting that particular ordinance or doing something different upon their own

5891017 the truth is you are a great being you have within you the compassion courage strength and wisdom to come from a high level at all times you act out roles that do not reflect the greatness of who you are but they are only roles and not your true self the more you can be aware of the thoughts coming into your mind the more control you will have over the drama that is happening inside of you you can think of your thoughts as little men that come marching up one two three if you could stop each one and hold it up to the light you would find better ways of thinking it is a matter of attention and awareness taking each thought you have and examining it to see if it really is a true statement or not

5891022 i know i just wanted to finish writing about my dream before i forgot all of the details
5891023 i dont know exactly all i saw was flashes of images we were in danger and she ran away
5891024 someone was calling me there was a long period of silence robert could tell that this was really bothering her he searched for the right words to say to comfort her although he didnt necessarily believe or understand her dreams they dont necessarily mean anything they are just random thoughts as you sleep
5891025 this was the first one about me so well wait and see if it happens
5891026 i know you want to believe that they are real but you have no proof plus dont you think that its a little weird to think that you can predict the future
5891027 the vatican has researched the subject and have ruled that its not possible unless its a rare occasion of a miracle
5891028 look how big the world is and look at everything that is going on in it if god was going to permit a miracle do you think it would be a teenage girl in the small town of hollows grove massachusetts
5891029 i know you and our faith dont understand i dont even understand but one day i will until then i cannot go back to church im not giving up on them and i dont want them to turn their back on me

5891041 it turns out that the varsity team hazes all the freshman that make the junior varsity team i got chased around and smacked in the ass with a plastic baseball bat i got off easy because i heard george fanger had to drink a container of pickle juice and they duct taped his pants around his waist
5891042 what did you think about what happened to derek jenson
5891043 she probably couldnt find dad so she is sitting somewhere else
5891044 i dont know if i want to ive heard stories about this place
5891045 ghosts arent real and if they were they arent going to hurt anyone
5891046 cmon i dont want to go in there by myself
5891047 back in the sixties a couple of kids got away from their parents on a hiking trip and got lost in the woods did anyone look
5891048 they say after he died he came back to these woods to make sure those kids never get out and no more ever get in
5891049 next time let it finish dissolving before you kiss me
5891050 um no sir there are no signs of any wounds or attack at all but the girlfriend alleges they were at an old house in the woods making out and they were attacked by a tall dark ghost while two little ghost kids one boy and one girl watched
5891051 let me start with what we know derek and his girlfriend kelly who is sitting over there
5891052 skipped school this morning and decided to come out to the woods in hopes of seeing a ghost
5891053 back in sixty five two little kids disappeared in these woods during the search the police found a homeless man named edward gains who had a knife with some blood on it they questioned him and because he was not mentally sound they got no answers so they threw him into belthezar asylum where he died several years later it was a big thing to happen in a small town where nothing happens ever since then the legend started and since then it only grew that all three of them are in the woods
5891054 anyways they walked through the woods and up to the house
5891055 so the last time she saw him he was in the woods
5891056 so how did his body end up on the side of the road
5891057 got some pot some pills and it looks like crystal meth
5891058 she is going to be fine once she is able to put together complete sentences
5891059 send her to the hospital and i want a toxicology report and i want the autopsy report on my desk for derek as soon as its ready
5891060 the story about alexander solzhenitsen and the old man who made the sign of the cross was first told by solzhenitsyn to a group of christian leaders and later recounted by billy graham in his new years telecast 1977 it has been retold subsequently most publicly by senator jesse helms r nc
5891061 aqu est n los cinco mejores de la competencia pero nos sentimos muy bien aunque definitivamente hay cosas que mejorar salimos muy bien pero nos falt fuerza en la ltima parte sin embargo aqu estamos para aprender y corregir las fallas
5891062 aqu estamos las mejores 16 duplas del mundo y por eso es importante para nosotros poder llegar a estas instancias
5891063 la preparaci n es parte fundamental para este tipo de prueba nosotros agradecemos a francisco castro que estuvo entren ndonos los ltimos dos meses gracias a l logramos la clasificaci n
5891064 a pesar que en horas de la tarde es m s fresco en este lugar el horario no es el mejor para nosotros com nmente competemos en la ma ana pero nos adaptamos bien igual que al clima los primeros d as era sofocante pero ahora mejor
5891065 la coreana es una jugadora muy r pida pero no como para desmeritar el nivel de fabiola lo nico que nos falt fue quitarle el primer o segundo set si eso hubiese ocurrido el juego cambia porque la coreana ten a que empezar a pensar d ndole confianza a fabiola
5891066 no es por justificar pero sab amos que la tarea era tit nica con respecto a fabiola ramos como atleta pienso que est sentando un precedente para que todos los jugadores que vienen en formaci n sepan que ese complejo de pensar que no se puede se supera con la preparaci n no hay justificarse despu s de cada derrota sino de prepararse para ir a la victoria
5891067 nosotros salimos de beijing a caracas a ver cu ndo hay unos juegos bolivarianos unos centroamericanos mientras que los europeos y los asi ticos salen de aqu a esperar que inicien sus ligas cada uno de estos muchachos llega a un evento importante con m s de mil 200 partidos encima en la formaci n cada atleta necesita tener una capacidad competitiva y eso es lo que le hace falta a nuestro deporte
5891068 fue un juego muy cerrado y la diferencia estuvo en la recepci n en la que comet algunas fallas
5891069 estas han sido mis mejores juegos ol mpicos porque por primera vez alcanc un triunfo en individual y pas a la segunda ronda
5891070 no estoy satisfecha porque uno siempre quiere llegar a la final y ganar una medalla ol mpica pero es bueno saber que fui la nica latinoamericana que avanz hasta la ronda de las 32 mejores del mundo
5891071 hice un buen planteamiento del partido pero al momento de la ejecuci n me equivoqu recibiendo
5891072 le di muchas bolas f ciles y ella me contraatac con mucha facilidad
5891073 jugar contra una zurda es muy complicado porque resulta dif cil leer hacia d nde lanzar los golpes
5891074 trat de hacer mi juego de meter mis disparos pero al momento de decidir los puntos cuando el juego iba siete a siete fall dejando la pelota muy larga o muy corta
5891075 ese sentimiento pena ajena es el mismo que sentimos nosotros por el rid culo que est n haciendo en uruguay el alcalde leopoldo l pez y los diputados de podemos juan jos molina y hermes garc a lo que se est discutiendo en el seno de la comisi n de ciudadan a y derechos humanos es el atropello y el abuso por parte de la diputada adriana pe a quien es orquestada por sectores oposicionistas y por los medios de difusi n privados
5891076 estuvimos revisando todos los aspectos vinculados a lo que se refiere a la planta en eso hay absoluta normalidad
5891077 conformar mesas de trabajo con el fin de hacer un recuento de los conflictos laborales que se presenten vamos a absorber a los trabajadores en su totalidad en ese recuento estableceremos cuantos son los trabajadores y cuanto tiempo tienen contratados
5891078 igualmente vamos a establecer una mesa para tratar el tema relacionado al impacto ambiental producido por esta empresa el problema radica en que el tipo de tecnolog a que utiliza esta obsoleta por lo que emite una cantidad importante de polvo y part culas nocivas para la salud en este sentido estableceremos un plan de acci n de inmediato para solventar estos asuntos
5891079 en el establecimiento de la mesa de trabajo incluiremos a la comunidad es muy importante que los consejos comunales se incorporen ahora que esta empresa pertenece al estado venezolano esto no puede seguir siendo un enclave que este aislado a la realidad de guanta

5891083 a man a homeless person came and pulled the motorbike off and he picked me up and lay me down on the ground so i was away from the bike
5891084 we would like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway consumer culture we currently have
5891085 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5891086 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
5891087 films are the only things by which to look inside people and thats why people are so fond of movies and why theyll never die

5891098 as fatties and poor people you dont have the ability to decide when and how you eat so we are making the decision for you if only by degree
5891099 the government just crossed a line out of principle they just destroyed the basic fabric of adam smiths guiding hand the essence of the free market
5891100 the basic principle of the free market is that you let supply and demand control the market not governmental regulation regulation should only exist when the free market doesnt have the capability of control or influence
5891101 in this instance the government decided that they didnt want poor people exposed to fast food clearly unjustified governmental interference
5891102 as fatties and poor people you dont have the ability to decide when and how you eat so we are making the decision for you if only by degree
5891103 industrious americans will instead open cafes that serve fresh foods
5891104 the government telling people what they can and cant do
5891105 you cant push harmful products on citizens because it harms society as a whole
5891106 were talking about banning the sale of food to adults
5891107 the govt isnt saying anything the city council is saying
5891108 this is a clear example of a government overstepping its authority
5891109 and youre one of those people that think that no matter what the government tries to do its always because they think we cant do it ourselves
5891110 the mayor hasnt yet signed the ordinance but he probably will since it passed unanimously it doesnt affect existing restaurants
5891111 the mayor hasnt yet signed the ordinance but he probably will
5891112 if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animated contest of freedom go from us in peace we ask not your counsels or arms crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
5891113 oh look the average wage just went up unemployment is down poverty is down vote for me 1one
5891114 poor neighborhood public aid and public health la has a financial interest in making sure these people eat better
5891115 well its just fast food and were helping people be healthy
5891116 there are already tons of fast food places in poor la neighborhoods and fast food is narrowly defined as a non table waited pre prepared food venue
5891117 we need more limits on our freedoms for our own good
5891118 will just continue to serve the ignorant masses the fatty foods they want
5891119 ultimately this ordinance is about providing choices something that is currently lacking in our community
5891120 this ordinance is in no way attempting to tell people what to eat but rather responding to the need to attract sit down restaurants full service grocery stores and healthy food alternatives
5891121 ultimately this ordinance is about providing choices something that is currently lacking in our community south los angeles represents a mere 32 square miles of a city that is 468 square miles in size and yet it is home to the largest percentage of fast food establishments
5891122 hey man you have to pay my medical bills now watch me do stupid dangerous stuff
5891123 it appeared that if the doctor didnt fill out a dose or indicate how often the medicine should be taken a default amount such as

5891387 ok just sign this letting us know you told us you account of what happened and well get you to your hotel

5891389 we dont really know her we just know her father
5891390 hello detective rossi i havent seen you since my mother died
5891391 hannah why did you kill two of those kids and try to kill the other three
5891392 they were always using my daddy and keeping him away from me
5891393 the university was running a new column contest for the schools paper my dad was the one in charge of picking the new column my idea was a behind the scenes type thing on how teachers get their teaching skills working and goddess was a gossip column for some reason daddy thought goddess idea was the best and gave the column to her
5891394 so you felt betrayed because goddess column got your fathers pick
5891395 seans known as one of the universitys best soccer players on august seventeenth sean invited daddy to one of his big games i remember the date because it was my birthday and because of sean i spent my birthday at home eating cold sandwiches instead of eating at a nice restaurant with my daddy
5891396 everlee is probably the nicest out of the whole group for a while she was the only one i didnt have a problem with then one night i had to work late at the diner and one of her classes ran late i guess daddy saw her struggling to get her car started and he offered to drive her back to her dorm building so because of everlee i had to walk home in the pouring rain
5891397 yes the only girl my daddy needs in his life is me
5891398 my dad had the day off that day and we were suppose to spend the day at the zoo just me and him
5891399 it was really fun for the full hour we were there
5891400 he got a call from my mom asking him to come home i begged my dad to let us stay but he said my mom really wanted to see him we got home and i stormed upstairs and sat at the top step i heard my mom tell him she wanted to send me to another relative for a while so they could work there marriage out
5891401 daddy told her he had some stuff to do but he would meet her at some fancy restaurant i dont remember the name she said she was gonna take a bath and i knew shed be in there a while i went into the garage and got into daddys tool box and took out this big pair of scissors i went out to her car and cut the break wire about an hour after she left my dad came home crying
5891402 i asked him what was wrong and he said mom died in a crash
5891403 yeah my friend was a officer on that case and he said a cord had been cut
5891404 she was trying to keep me from my dad and i wasnt gonna let that happen
5891405 i just wanted to come by and apologize for everything hannah did
5891406 its ok mr spilt you didnt know what she was planning
5891407 take care and i hope i see you all next year
5891408 ive took out the campus jock and the school slut only three left to go
5891409 this vent is big enough for us to crawl through
5891410 we dont know how strong this guy is he could bust down that door
5891411 lets go hide in the back room so we dont get seen
5891412 im gonna go see if i can find a way to get out of here
5891413 well see that mr spilt thing was just to cover up my crush on sean
5891414 so all this time youve had a crush on sean
5891415 i thought that if i told you guys you would try to push us together
5891416 well judging from that kiss i dont think sean would have minded i knew we should gone through with our plan on prom night
5891417 we were gonna plan to meet on prom but me goddie and shane wouldnt show it would only be you and sean we sorta figured that you guys would be a cute couple
5891418 the killer tried to get me but i jumped over him and as i did he cut my leg a little
5891419 your leg is gonna get infected if it isnt taken care of
5891420 im gonna go one of those first aid kits you found
5891421 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5891422 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5891423 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5891424 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5891425 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5891426 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5891427 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5891428 it took months and months of negotiations to get israel to allow some spare parts through the borders
5891429 what we really need is for things to be modernised we have funding and planning but israel wont allow the machinery in
5891430 its affecting our port its affecting the fishermen its affecting the fish we eat and the people swimming in the sea
5891431 the sewage has no border and has spread right along our coastline
5891432 since sanctions it is very difficult to get the ingredients i need
5891433 we have had to cut production drastically to keep going
5891434 i thought things would improve with the ceasefire and that more things would be allowed into gaza but nothing changed nothing changed at all
5891435 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
5891436 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
5891437 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
5891438 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
5891439 soon as that script come back in and they tweak that thing out we gonna go ahead and get movin
5891440 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5891441 its been four years since the last one so it just seems like the timing is really good now for us to just recreate it in a way
5891442 we are telling the origin story again but beyond certain broad stroke details its really quite a reinvention i would say
5891443 im not even sure if i would say reinvention i think don has really created some really clever twists and expectations that a fan of the first childs play film you will be surprised and shocked by but it will follow i think very closely a lot of the first film
5891444 audience thinks it is going to go one way and we will go another even though the story is pretty similar
5891445 i think we would love to have it out for next year but i dont think its going to happen
5891446 will doing this right now make me truly happy will it make me a better person will it make the world a better place
5891447 doctors have come from distant cities just to see me stand over my bed disbelieving what theyre seeing

5891451 she never really had her daddy in her life so she was looking for somebody just to hold her and he held her
5891452 i got a good look at his arms and my fiance saw the other side of his arms and we were just shocked you know this is the guy
5891453 he just turned around and ran and yelled back at me go ahead and shoot me and continued to run north away from me
5891454 im 62 the lady was 61 that could have been me
5891455 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
5891456 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change
5891457 oh no we hit the level cap what do we do now
5891458 damn you just leveled to max sorry mate rip it to shreds and roll a new one

5891461 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5891462 we do not claim that the findings demonstrate a level of self consciousness or self reflection typical of humans
5891463 the findings do however show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner so far only clearly found in apes and at least suggestively in dolphins and elephants
5891464 this is a remarkable capability that is at least a pre requisite of self recognition and might play a role in perspective taking

5891474 by participating in the water campaign the city of mandurah is responding decisively to the vital issue of climate change and its increasing importance to water management
5891475 local governments continue to lead in environmental issues and the citys actions are helping to reduce the impact on our water resources through the water campaign which has resulted in many environmental financial and social benefits
5891476 communities are aware of the urgent need to act on climate change and local government has a significant role to play in the sustainable management of our precious and limited water resources
5891477 the water campaign demonstrates how local government can make a difference their combined efforts are delivering real benefits in sustainable water management across australia
5891478 knowing i can rely on schools in the district makes my election preparations much easier
5891479 some of the principals made excellent suggestions for improvement which have since been acted upon

5891492 the russian federation will not be able to support the draft resolution of the security council submitted by france today the representative of france has just referred to two elements in the peace plan there are six principles which were proclaimed by the presidents of france and russia
5891493 whatever the reasons the russia federation claims it had to enter georgia it is abundantly clear today on august 19th that it has no business being in georgia anymore and needs to leave
5891494 1922 colorado river compact to take water from the so called upper basin states including colo and n m where the river originates and give it to lower basin states like his home state of ariz
5891495 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil
5891496 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
5891497 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5891498 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
5891499 were not trying to refrigerate the entire state of illinois are we
5891500 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
5891501 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
5891502 clintons 35 years of finance experience will be helpful during this transition period

5891507 i enjoy playing with josh kennedy and tonight i must admit felt like the best weve performed together
5891508 i scored the first goal of my season during this trip to twente for sure its intense pleasure but the most important thing was first of all winning this game
5891509 we expected a tough game and suffered during the first half because they put us under pressure
5891510 im very pleased with this game overall im very pleased with the performance
5891511 i know most of the players and in the second half brought in some new ones we played very well in the first half but we were broken in the second
5891512 my squad needs to be kept fresh at this stage of the season there are still eleven places up for grabs for our first world cup qualifier against uzbekistan
5891513 you hear little whispers and given the form rio has been in and what manchester united have achieved i did think he would get it
5891514 it was a bit nerve wracking and i was actually standing next to rio when fabio told us all after training
5891515 the first thing he did was turn to me and shake my hand that is a measure of the kind of guy he is
5891516 he is an unbelievable player and provides the sort of an example we can all learn from that
5891517 ill sit here and say we have to qualify for the world cup and nothing more simple as that
5891518 ive personally learned a few things from the last campaign and ill not be talking about winning the world cup or anything like that
5891519 ive learned from talking about i want to win the euros and things like that
5891520 i knew i would have to take a step back to take a step forward
5891521 it was my choice to leave feyenoord but i knew that i could eventually get back up again and here i am now at a huge club like celtic
5891522 i played with the national team all the way to under 21 level who did i play with wesley sneijder van persie rafael van der vaart johnny heitinga most of the ones who are now in the senior squad i knew i was not ready to make the step up but i feel i am getting better and coming closer to the level required lets hope i can take that step at celtic
5891523 we want to win everything and to do that we need a good squad

5891539 the absence of teachers from classrooms for various reasons has also put pressure on schools and the ministry to consider ways of ensuring that teaching and learning is conducted daily and in an effective manner in all classrooms in the country
5891540 this is an exciting initiative and consultants from darwin australia are now in the country to design a system of interactive teaching
5891541 a studio will be set up at the fcae campus three schools have been selected to pilot the program in 2009 through this system schools in the interior and the outer islands are expected to be linked to the system and they will be able to access the teaching that will be provided from the studio in suva

5891554 zoals competenties van de leraren de sfeer en het pedagogisch klimaat is uiteraard van groot belang voor de kwalititeit van een school deze kenmerken moeten echter niet als doel op zich worden beschouwd zij moeten ten dienste staan van het realiseren van de doelen van het onderwijs
5891555 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
5891556 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
5891557 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
5891558 firstly we must continue to invest in our strategic priorities
5891559 secondly we must maintain our conviction for the way we manage money
5891560 finally we must respond to the overall decline in market levels by continuing to review elements of

5891566 el gobierno y los legisladores que lo defienden en el congreso han montado un gran teatro para que creamos que se pelean con el grupo marsans pero en realidad lo que quiere es arreglar la deuda y el fraude en aerol neas argentinas porque son corresponsables
5891567 con su proyecto el gobierno busca que todos los argentinos nos hagamos cargo de las obligaciones que le corresponden el grupo marsans que surgen de administraci n fraudulenta y vaciamiento de la empresa
5891568 estas acciones tienen que ver con delitos que demostramos claramente y presentamos en la justicia no s lo por responsabilidad del grupo marsans sino de funcionarios nacionales entre ellos ricardo jaime
5891569 la salida se tiene que buscar no en el marco de la actual situaci n de cesaci n de pagos y el concurso de la empresa aerol neas argentinas sino a trav s de la creaci n de una nueva empresa

5891584 the measure will not only help thousands of borrowers facing financial trouble to stay in their homes but pave the way for thousands more to achieve the dream of becoming first time homeowners
5891585 the housing legislation will give the states housing market the shot in the arm it needs for recovery
5891586 the federal housing bill will provide stability in our economy and help boost home buyer confidence it will also help many deserving homeowners who are facing foreclosure keep their homes
5891587 as home prices have adjusted to more affordable levels buyers have just the limited period of time to take advantage of these incentives

5891603 disfrutamos do calor porque j sentimos frio valoramos a luz porque conhecemos a escurid o e compreendemos a felicidade porque conhecemos a tristeza
5891604 os muros que constru mos ao nosso redor nos protegem contra a tristeza mas tamb m impedem que nos chegue a felicidade
5891605 existem tantas noites como dias e cada uma dura o mesmo que o dia que vem depois at a vida mais feliz n o pode ser medida sem alguns momentos de escurid o e a palavra feliz perderia o sentido se n o estivesse equilibrada pela tristeza
5891606 normalmente quando as pessoas est o tristes n o fazem nada se limitam a chorar mas quando sua tristeza se converte em indigna o s o capazes de fazer as coisas mudarem
5891607 lamentar as experi ncias vividas uma forma de impedir o pr prio desenvolvimento

5891621 given the lack of hard evidence why should people believe what you are telling them about the intervention
5891622 what do you have to say to those who view the intervention as a positive thing
5891623 if this intervention is so well underway why didnt you come sooner
5891624 what are realistic goals for us to set and what is the bottom line with regard to saving humanity from losing its self determination
5891625 can you influence people as powerfully as the visitors but for the good
5891626 how can we focus on this intervention given the immensity of other global problems which are occurring right now
5891627 you mention that individuals are being taken all over the world how can people protect themselves or others from being abducted
5891628 if the visitors encounter resistance in humanity or in certain individuals will they come in greater numbers or will they leave
5891629 what are the most important questions that we must ask of ourselves and others with respect to this problem of alien infiltration
5891630 are we humans alone within the universe or in our own world are we being visited at this time is this visitation beneficial to us do we need to prepare
5891631 you speak of other worlds emerging into the greater community can you speak of successes and failures which might have bearing on our situation
5891632 because the visitors are so skilled in projecting thoughts and influencing peoples mental environment how do we ensure ourselves that what we are seeing is real
5891633 you speak about keeping knowledge alive how many will it take to keep knowledge alive in the world
5891634 can individuals who are strong with knowledge influence the visitors
5891635 in other worlds that have successfully unified did they maintain their individual freedom of thought
5891636 this message is coming through one man why arent you contacting everybody if this is so important

5891642 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
5891643 my response simply was did you really just ask me that
5891644 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
5891645 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
5891646 shes stating what she wants and hes evaluating if he wants to go there

5891707 we think there could be three cuts in a row

5891725 eight of the guardsmen were indicted by a grand jury the guardsmen claimed to have fired in self defense which was generally accepted by the criminal justice system in 1974 u s district judge frank battisti dismissed charges against all eight on the basis that the prosecutions case was too weak to warrant a trial
5891726 the years following the shootings 1970 to 1979 were filled with lawsuits filed by families of the victims against the state of ohio in hopes of placing blame on governor rhodes and the ohio national guard trials were held on both the federal and state level but all ended in acquittals or were dismissed there was one civil trial for wrongful death and injury brought by the victims and their families against governor rhodes and the national guardsmen that was originally dismissed but eventually the dismissal was overturned due to the judge excluding evidence the students families were awarded approximately 63 000 per victim and the defendants agreed to state for the record that they regretted their actions

5891742 how long would it take for our political leaders to denounce such measures as an act of war against innocent civilians that must be combated at all costs
5891743 if our political leaders were threatening annihilation of israel how long until our citizens would step up and say cut the out
5891744 its sad that so many people just sit on their couches munching on fritos and oreos and consume the latest propoganda and dont really know the real history of the world
5891745 and quite frankly if unconditional surrender wasnt worth 300 000 americans dying then it wasnt worth 300 000 japanese dying
5891746 iran has not threatened the annihilation of israel this is propaganda fed to the gullible
5891747 largest prison population per capita in the world america is so far from a free country it isnt even funny
5891748 how efficiently certain views that deviate from the elite consensus are banished from sight simply prohibited even when those views are held by the vast majority of citizens this discrepancy is a potent commentary on how our democracy functions
5891749 as far as the argument in this article both israelis and palestinians are retarded
5891750 the rest of you all are morons who dont understand how democracy works
5891751 as far as the argument in this article both israelis and palestinians are retarded how can you back either side
5891752 ask the average citizens on the street whether we are in a recession and they will say we are even though we are not but they have been pounded by the liberal media to believe something that is not true
5891753 while some people use the old rule of thumb that a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of declining gdp the actual working definition is a bit more nuanced
5891754 a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months
5891755 i am one of those people who defines it as two consecutive quarters of declining gdp the official definition the nber is a private organization that has no official role in determining any economic statistics
5891756 how could you the poor jewish survivors need all the help they can get
5891757 thus we have the extraordinary fact that a policy that has long been favored by the vast majority of americans even handedness in the israel palestinian conflict is one that no mainstream american politician of any national significance can espouse without triggering an immediate end to their political career
5891758 in 1983 50 corporations controlled the vast majority of all news media in the u
5891759 in the u s fewer than two dozen of these extraordinary creatures own and operate 90 of the mass media

5891765 america is only approves of our president by 31 which we are reminded of daily in the news

5891773 i told the country we did that and i told them it was legal we had legal opinions that enabled us to do it
5891774 clearly nothing in the bill of rights says that newspapers and government cannot cooperate on occasion but the intent of the founders was that the press and government should not become institutional partners they are natural adversaries with different functions and each must respect the role of the other sometimes a free press can be a distinct annoyance and an embarrassment to a particular government but that is one of the prices of liberty a free press is responsible to its readers and to them alone
5891775 just the simple hope that someone will confess what you want to hear is not good proof in itself
5891776 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue

5891779 one way or the other we are determined to deny iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them that is our bottom line
5891780 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program
5891781 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
5891782 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
5891783 w e urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs
5891784 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
5891785 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
5891786 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs reports indicate that biological chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre gulf war status in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
5891787 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandate of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and th e means of delivering them
5891788 we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
5891789 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
5891790 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
5891791 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons
5891792 i will be voting to give the president of the united states the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam hussein because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security
5891793 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years we also should remember we have always underestimated the progress saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction
5891794 he has systematically violated over the course of the past 11 years every significant un resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons and any nuclear capacity this he has refused to do
5891795 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
5891796 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction
5891797 without question we need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real
5891798 an impeachment process would greatly harm the country and our democracy if every president came into office expecting to be impeached it would not be long before we became a one party sham democracy
5891799 dracostimpy my dear old friend the one thing ive always tried to do in life is to give women all the respect and birth control pills and jobs and even letting them vote that they deserve because thats just how much i heath ledger care about the womenfolk
5891800 bush pushed maliki to drop his support for obamas iraq plan
5891801 well i do believe in abstinence because our lord jesus christ
5891802 if there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official high or petty can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or other matters of opinion
5891803 americans cannot catch up quickly enough anyhow so keep buying that birth control the life you may prevent is your child
5891804 in this case not only will it keep birth control away from women that want to plan childhood but it keeps birth control away from women that need it for other health reasons
5891805 he doesnt care how they get out of new orleans

5891986 the glory of the gospel is that god has declared christians to be rightly related to him in spite of their sin but our greatest temptation and mistake is to try to smuggle character into his work of grace how easily we fall into the trap of assuming that we can only remain justified so long as there are grounds in our character for justification but pauls teaching is that nothing we do ever contributes to our justification

5892006 but the geographer department is buying into it in a big way they say that geography is now all relative to individuals and isnt based on any consensus we all occupy our own spaces nobody else can understand the way i live in my space so it isnt really possible to do social geography any more everyone is coming to the conclusion that we are all so different that we are practically alone in the world
5892007 and as if that wasnt enough they are saying that consumerism is producing mutated people they say that society is changing so fast that we will never be able to understand it bever be able to catch up with ourselves it all boils down to people believing that it is now impossible to understand what is real
5892008 no no i dont but so many people are saying it that i am not sure that i can keep up with them intellectually i feel like i am being swept off my feet and to be honest there are times when i just dont know why i dont believe it everyone else seems so certain i am hanging on with god but i dont just want to do it blindly any more than i want to follow the herd in the department blindly i want to know if there are real answers that i can take back there

5892015 bees have an extensive behavioural repertoire allowing scientists studying them to learn about vision olfaction memory and learning and even aggression all human traits
5892016 bees offer a good research model because they are studied in a natural setting that is easily accessible to scientists
5892017 importantly from a neuroscience perspective while the bee brain is only about the size a of a sesame seed it has many of the characteristics of the human brain including complex behaviours such as advanced memory and learning

5892142 therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord touch no unclean thing and i will receive you
5892143 as you sent me into the world i have sent them into the world
5892144 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him
5892145 do not love the world or the things in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions is not from the father but is from the world

5892152 they could not trust god for the holy joy of eating meat or drinking wine because they lacked some crucial knowledge

5892154 i know and am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean in itself but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean
5892155 whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats because the eating is not from faith for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin
5892156 he will be upheld for the lord is able to make him stand
5892157 i have become all things to all men so that by all possible means i might save some

5892177 we have separated the ages very much to the loss of each age in the new testament the christian church is an all age community and in real life the experience of the family to look no further should convince us that the interaction of the ages is enriching the principle is that generations should be mixed up in the church for the glory of god that doesnt mean we shouldnt disciple groups of people of the same age or the same sex separately from time to time thats a good thing to do but for the most part the right thing is the mixed community in which everybody is making the effort to understand and empathize with all the other people in the other age groups make the effort is the key phrase here older people tend not to make the effort to understand younger people and younger people are actually encouraged not to make the effort to understand older people thats a loss of a crucial christian value in my judgement if worship styles are so fixed that whats being offered fits the expectations the hopes even the prejudices of any one of these groups as opposed to the others i dont believe the worship style glorifies god and some change some reformation some adjustment and some enlargement of spiritual vision is really called for
5892178 as you watch tv missiologically you start to see what is becoming popular and why what youll find is that various parts of television reveal different gods theres a god of sex a god of sports a god of fame and glory and power and money and its neo paganism and you need to watch it like a missionary looking for the idols not just the entertainment
5892179 i dont let my kids watch tv because then theyll be corrupted
5892180 i want them to see that tv shows are sermons movies are sermons and we need to exegete them as well because they are communicating a gospel of conversion to someone or something

5892201 we will continue to campaign aggressively while the court continues in its process to ensure all candidates in this race are eligible
5892202 i think kim brimer has gone around and tried to shop this to different courts
5892203 hell have to abide by the process kim brimer waited until july to file this thats like creating your own emergency and calling an ambulance
5892204 each and every time we have proposed giving voters in this district a chance to hear us both speak on the issues they care about kim brimer has refused while referencing his unsuccessful antics in court however when it comes to mingling with donors and ensuring that he has enough funds in his campaign account to continue to fund his lavish lifestyle he conveniently forgets his excuses for not campaigning so mr brimer which is it
5892205 mr brimer believes that wendys candidacy is enough to kick off a campaign and to ask donors for money but not enough to warrant a discussion on the issues
5892206 that mentality is precisely the reason that voters across tarrant county are so hungry for a change in leadership

5892248 an emergency order that temporarily restricted short sales in the shares of and last but not least in the realm of comic relief comes word that harvey pitt the worst sec chairman in recent history is trying to cash in on the naked shorting hysteria with something called regsho
5892249 pitt is running out of admirers in washington with the possible exception of folks at the mine safety and health administration hes the only one in the capital who gets into deeper holes than they do

5892255 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
5892256 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
5892257 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
5892258 the geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what youre effectively doing is pumping water below ground where its heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station
5892259 if you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the coast could be comparable to coal
5892260 if on the other hand youre talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central australia and then building large transmission lines to adelaide and sydney the costs are going to be too expensive
5892261 in theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and theyve got to move onto another field
5892262 then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field
5892263 what were primarily seeing is that there is an increase in vegetation in northern canada
5892264 areas that were normally occupied by herbs for example are becoming occupied by shrubs were seeing a migration of the tree line northwards these sorts of changes have implications on wildlife and the people who depend on wildlife in the north
5892265 meet the needs of a much larger but stabilizing human population sustain the life support systems of the planet and substantially reduce hunger and poverty
5892266 in certain spots in the building you would not be able to tell if the air conditioning was on or not
5892267 supporting parents getting students to school on time and consistently
5892268 its just making sure that were keeping the learning environment distraction free
5892269 its hard not to talk about next year when we talk about this year
5892270 we have three whole schools worth of stuff to move and that doesnt include the personal instructional effects of teachers
5892271 these are kids who probably graduate from high school but college has never been a reality for them
5892272 you cut almost 10 percent of an 8 million budget and that gets pretty hard
5892273 i think part of it is with the higher gas prices were not finding as many people willing to drive from the metro out here theyre looking for jobs closer to home
5892274 this is an exciting year for broadcasting in china as local audience interest in the olympic games is at an unprecedented level
5892275 we are very pleased to have envivio as an encoder partner as they have shown strong commitment to the chinese market with their early implementation of the avs standard
5892276 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
5892277 we need a call to action not a call to go to another conference
5892278 the reason these populations are doing well is that this is one of only two large remaining blocks of rainforest in the whole world
5892279 of course most gorillas most chimpanzees mot primates arent so lucky to live in areas with such a huge unbroken expanse of habitat left for them
5892280 we have the formal commitment from the president sassou nguesso to work with us to create this as a protected area probably as a national park over the coming years
5892281 as the funding becomes available to do that and as international plans move forward for thinking about how countrys can be rewarded for protecting their forests and not promoting climate change
5892282 retraso cuando se escribe en el terminal y tambi n el problema del

5892285 but its what i call the ayf factor attractive young females are the canary in the coal mine of public transit theyre sensitive to safety and they want to be in a nice spot if you draw them in you are reaching a broad market a whole lot of transit systems when you look around you notice certain populations are missing
5892286 so the bus is not sitting at the station while people dig into their pockets and shove crummy dollars into the fare box but most systems have on board fare collection we need to try to get away from that but its pretty expensive to implement even though fare collection can have a significant impact on the quality of service
5892287 were trying to work it into the regional go pass system
5892288 but were not sure if that will be in place by the time buses are running
5892289 this is a very very different operation and very exciting
5892290 because buses will move into and out of downtown very quickly with three times as many boardings as exist today
5892291 its relieved the pressure of being overpopulated and thats a good thing
5892292 our parents are doing more fundraising than they have in the past

5892304 serving two meals a day makes us the largest restaurant in oklahoma
5892305 the free and reduced numbers are the canary in the minefield for me because they are an indication of poverty and poverty does bad things to children
5892306 we happen to be a state that benefits from high oil prices but at the same time high oil prices are driving some of the poverty that is going on
5892307 weve got various different ideas i think all the leads on the team all have their own idea what the demo should be and it obviously makes sense for the demo to happen before the game ships we all feel that its essential because the game is so different

5892322 no hay desarrollo ilimitado para un planeta de recursos limitados
5892323 con la ofrenda se inician a la manera tradicional de los pueblos originarios de m xico y la regi n una serie de reflexiones multidisciplinarias sobre el d a de la tierra para las naciones unidas la celebraci n de actividades como las jornadas de la d cimo novena ofrenda a nuestra madre tierra son de especial importancia pues permiten la construcci n de esa revoluci n de las conciencias que nos permitir vivir una vez m s en armon a con el planeta la madre tierra
5892324 hace casi 40 a os que se celebra cada 22 de abril el d a de la tierra las naciones unidas se han adherido a esta conmemoraci n con el prop sito de fomentar el cari o y el respeto hacia nuestro planeta reflexionar sobre la salud de la tierra y promover el cuidado de nuestros recursos naturales con esta conmemoraci n celebramos la interdependencia de todos los seres vivientes es un d a para observar el equilibrio entre las fuerzas de la naturaleza y celebrar su renovaci n

5892329 well probably discuss that in the future the numbers are not high enough yet to make it worthwhile but our demand is certainly increasing
5892330 sonics 3 400 units are pretty spread out so it buys national cable advertising and theres natural spill into other markets
5892331 they cant control that its much more cost effective for them and we get the advantage of awareness for multiple years
5892332 well have a plan in place and one that learns from our earlier experiences we work with local police and we have our own traffic management service were learning from that first opening and elk river went seamlessly

5892334 tu eres makerito no por eso te arde que tedigan que la porqueria del chaph sin nombre
5892335 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
5892336 well i dont know what that means but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
5892337 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5892338 we are working with the governor and assembly to reduce state spending to help address our current budget problem without hurting our schools hospitals and local governments
5892339 if the assembly were to join us and pass this spending cap we could make a structural change to reduce state spending and increase accountability in future years and prevent the kind of fiscal challenges we are dealing with right now new york has a spending problem not a taxing problem and a spending cap is the right answer to solve it
5892340 this cap would slam the door on massive increases in state spending and hold a governor accountable for maintaining a balanced budget
5892341 the family budget is more important than the state budget and we have to stand up to protect taxpayers from being taxed out of their homes
5892342 one of the underlying contributors to the high gas prices especially in upstate new york is a little known practice known as zone pricing the oil companies know that through zone pricing they can target certain areas where people are more apt to pay higher prices for gasoline this legislation will put an end to that practice making it illegal and ultimately saving people money
5892343 i talked to my doctor and he said i tore some ligaments or something
5892344 its something where he still has to wear a cast because of a bruise
5892345 we think by the time we get to the season opener that it will be a non issue
5892346 the problem is hes got to wear that cast throughout all these practices and probably will still have to have it on this week
5892347 its hard to tackle its hard to be a corner with a cast on but its the situation that it is and well make the best of it
5892348 theres nothing telling us that theres going to be surgery
5892349 everything tells us that hes going to be ok for the opener we think that it will be over by then
5892350 i intend to wage this campaign and to govern this country in a way that they would be proud of me
5892351 im going to raise the level of political dialogue in america and im going to treat my opponents with respect and demand that they treat me with respect

5892358 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
5892359 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
5892360 youve got to react and thats part of playing the position and its part of being a good offense
5892361 i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before it is just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
5892362 some of the practices that he hasnt participated in are still things that he has done before not new things
5892363 but to the extent if there are new things and the player misses those then we will need to catch him up on it because the rest of the team has got it
5892364 any time you can get into game situations and get out there and be in game speed its great for the development process
5892365 the more you do it obviously the more comfortable you become
5892366 hes always very supportive and points out things that he thinks that i could get better on and also points out the things that i did really well
5892367 this is great getting a regular cable show is something ive wanted
5892368 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5892369 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5892370 at that point the georgian leadership told some of us we have no choice but to defend our villages and our people and lift the cease fire our message remained the same that we understand the predicament you face
5892371 but we strongly recommend that you not engage in a direct military conflict with russia because that is unwinnable
5892372 were not trying to issue vague empty threats or wag our finger but simply stating the fact that this military operation has imposed a serious cost on russia in terms of its standing in the world
5892373 thats not as good thing its not something that we relish its not something that we want to see happen
5892374 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5892375 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5892376 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5892377 last friday the day before the lake tahoe summit i slipped and broke my left ankle while i was on a walk with congresswoman ellen tauscher on the meeks bay trail in the tahoe forest
5892378 my doctor has advised me not to travel in the short term and so regretfully i am unable to attend what will surely be an historic convention in denver
5892379 we are questioning him on the details of other locals involved in the terror attack
5892380 we are certainly examining legal options and will file a petition with the telecom tribunal soon
5892381 the existing agreement applies only to the interconnection between gsm networks and cdma network there is a material change in the licence conditions as the gsm network roll out is a new aspect hence the interconnection agreement has to be renegotiated
5892382 neben cappuccino latte macchiato und co kann diese maschine auch eine ganze kanne kaffee auf knopfdruck zubereiten
5892383 yes brt in theory but there isnt room for the infrastructure
5892384 now that i have had to explain it it is no longer funny as you were
5892385 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5892386 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5892387 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5892388 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5892389 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5892390 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5892391 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5892392 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5892393 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5892394 i dont want to talk about it she explained again
5892395 people used to call me a baby but i am not a baby anymore or a half child either
5892396 this is the olympic games i didnt even consider it as an option
5892397 the target was within my reach i was in good shape in fact i was in better shape than what i was in athens where she jumped 6 83 her best so far for the sixth place the conditions were very good it is very disappointing to finish like this
5892398 i dont know whether i will be able to jump in the london olympics in 2012 i will be there for the commonwealth games in delhi and the asian games that is the plan for now
5892399 the jetflash v95 is an innovative marriage of fashion and technology that not only offers elegant distinctive styling and ultra portable convenience but also performs brilliantly as an advanced storage device
5892400 it is likely that it will be difficult to reach a solution in the first meeting it may be reached in the second third or fourth meeting but opposition parties should continue with the dialogue
5892401 she should sit for a discussion with the government make her presentation and the government will try to solve the problem
5892402 it is much less than 400 acres the land is not in a single stretch but dispersed in different areas on the project land
5892403 according to environment norms there is a need for a green patch ancilliary units are coming up moreover land is required to keep the cars therefore there is no empty land
5892404 similar cases of land return were filed in the supreme court from states like maharashtra and kerala the cases were dismissed
5892405 their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5892406 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5892407 there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5892408 the change may mean more assessments of the situation but time is running out to stage the event or move it elsewhere
5892409 weve discussed this with the experts who acknowledge that westerners are targets in pakistan whereas the biggest danger in sri lanka appears to be collateral damage
5892410 il vero mestiere dellanimale scrivere un romanzo in una soffitta
5892411 vivevo solitario e pazzo come uno spagnolo a mille leghe dalla vita reale
5892412 le arti il loro contenuto di verit lo hanno e non lo hanno
5892413 promessa di felicit ma una promessa che non viene mantenuta
5892414 non si limitato al genere non gradevole ma passato a quello terribile
5892415 michelangelo sconvolge la nostra immaginazione sotto il peso della sventura tocca il dolore
5892416 un movimento che pu essere paragonato allinizio ad uno scuotimento vale a dire a unattrazione e repulsione del medesimo oggetto che si avvicendano rapidamente
5892417 si attua cos il passaggio da una concezione razionale e intellettuale dellarte quale era in voga preso le accademie parigine dellepoca ad una naturalistica ed emotiva che porta stendhal ad avvicinare il sublime a michelangelo
5892418 mi si dir che mi diverto a creare paradossi a dare valore a dei nonnulla che anche io come sainte beuve ho i miei cari sconosciuti
5892419 un libro in cui il sublime erompe capitolo per capitolo
5892420 leggendo questo romanzo non incontrerete quelle digressioni che vengono giustamente definite tirate no i personaggi agiscono riflettono provano sentimenti e il dramma non si arresta mai
5892421 alla prima lettura quella che mi ha letteralmente sbalordito ho trovato dei difetti rileggendo le lungaggini sono sparite capivo la necessit del dettaglio che dapprima mi era parso troppo lungo e diffuso per rendere conto a voi lettori come si doveva ho percorso lopera occupato allora dello stile ho contemplato questo bel libro pi a lungo di quanto volessi e tutto mi parso molto armonioso collegato con naturalezza e con arte ma coerente
5892422 la soggettivit non in grado di non perdere terreno nei confronti del fluire costante monotono del tempo
5892423 lintera azione del romanzo si tramuti in una lotta continua contro il tempo
5892424 se malgrado la sua importanza ho atteso cos a lungo prima di parlare di questo libro credetemi mi risultava difficile acquistare una certa imparzialit non sono ancora certo di poterla mantenere a tal punto trovo questopera straordinaria ad una terza lettura lenta e meditata
5892425 soltanto la forma del trascendentale esilio dellidea il romanzo introduce nella serie dei suoi principi costitutivi il tempo effettivo la dur e bergsoniana
5892426 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5892427 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5892428 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5892429 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5892430 the important thing here is an adherence to the undertakings that russia has signed onto
5892431 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5892432 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces
5892433 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5892434 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5892435 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5892436 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5892437 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5892438 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5892439 price of two and three wheeler tyres for the replacement market has also been increased by 14 even then many a products have to be sold below the production cost
5892440 how many times can you go to the market and revise prices
5892441 whenever we have tried to ramp up our production in sahaganj there has been a problem i dont know whether it is a genuine technical problem or a created one but we dont have any evidence in hand about problems being purposely created
5892442 i watched a lot of film that off season so i had a better understanding of what routes to expect and what the opposing teams like to do i just did a lot of film study
5892443 ive seen him play the last couple of years and hes a real good athlete
5892444 hes a good playmaker i just want to make plays like he did for south florida and if you make plays youre going to get noticed
5892445 i thought about leaving school for the nfl a lot a lot of people were telling me different things i wasnt too disappointed with the third round grade because i know i need to improve more and ill be able to showcase my talents even more this year
5892446 i talked to my family i talked to my coaches and we all came to the conclusion that it would be best for me to come back to the team and help win a big east championship thats something i havent done yet and i wanted to be a part of something special here
5892447 every game we just have to come out with the mindset that its a new week and we have to win if we win we will be ok
5892448 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
5892449 warning electric stun devices used in this facility cbs4 showed its video to leaders of groups that plan to demonstrate during the convention
5892450 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
5892451 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
5892452 we want to make sure we got our game plan set
5892453 we want to make sure the entire procedure is laid out all the personnel know what they are supposed to do
5892454 the thing that i told him is that we are doing waterfront master planning and we arent sure where we want to go with the waterfront and our leases have been time limited
5892455 the sewer does not always smell pleasant so that might be a detriment to some of his passengers that are waiting to get on his helicopter
5892456 thats another condition that we disclose and if he decides it makes business sense for him then he solves those problems

5892459 i am deeply concerned about the two borough park abductions which have now been tied to the same assailant
5892460 already shaken by the recent assault this will make residents even more anxious about the safety of our children this is a community with a lot of children and they must be protected the nypd is to be commended for the significant resources they have committed to capturing this perpetrator
5892461 we are urging witnesses to come forward someone must have seen or heard something

5892470 it was an amazing feeling my dad had fixed it up for me i think it cost a fiver
5892471 he probably trains the hardest of anybody and hes very strict with himself but hes also a good guy he can turn off the competitive thing now and then and have a good laugh hes an inspiration
5892472 hes only human and hes got strengths and weaknesses well maybe not weaknesses maybe just weaker strengths but every time you do a personal best in training he gets up and beats it
5892473 you have to be very very careful about when you eat and when you rest
5892474 you get as much sleep as you can and you remind yourself that your opponents are having to do exactly the same as you so when youre tiring theyre tiring as well
5892475 i think the older you get the smarter you get you know the signs your body gives ive got stronger over the years ill have to take my foot off the gas pedal a little bit next year and try and build up for the london olympics but i feel very positive and im lucky i love what i do
5892476 i wouldnt be standing here with any medals round my neck if the meadowbank velodrome hadnt existed so who knows how many potential future olympic champions are out there why not built more facilities rather than knocking them down its about getting kids on bikes and into sport
5892477 we will carry on the luxurious visual styles of both operas
5892478 dragon robes and brocades from peking opera will be presented along with the loose bodied luminous tibetan clothes
5892479 i think its important that people realize that the olympic games can be gamed
5892480 its their way of showing see our system the chinese communist party put our country on top of the gold medals chart
5892481 my colleagues dont get it they try really hard but they never see that falling is the most important part of the act
5892482 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5892483 i think don has really created some really clever twists and expectations that a fan of the first childs play film you will be surprised and shocked by but it will follow i think very closely a lot of the first film against twists and turns that don has put into it that an audience thinks it is going to go one way and we will go another even though the story is pretty similar
5892484 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just
5892485 the french have suffered a major loss of life in what is being describe as a number of battles against the taliban
5892486 one specific incident was in the area of kabul which again will be a worrying thing for nato forces and for president karzai that the taliban are still strong enough to maintain this kind of attack and inflict these sort of casualities at a very sensitive time
5892487 their presence is afghanistan was recently beefed up by president
5892488 i think it will mirror something of the discussion in britain about the loss of life and the justification of that loss of life in a war that seems not to be going natos way
5892489 the taliban really do not give up despite the forces against them they appear to control more of the country given that they are able to strike with such force and with such loss of life so close to the capital
5892490 posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5892491 we wanted the biggest name in adult entertainment so we obviously went out and got jesse jane
5892492 this is jesses first time at our club but we expect good stuff from her she puts on an energetic show and we are really excited to have her so is everyone else because the phones have been ringing off the hook
5892493 the results are not obviously satisfactory to the state we want to see higher student achievement overall
5892494 immortal army of one is one of my personal favorites on ob servant the riffs on it are catchy as hell and stick in your head and it is a very brutal song yet it has a lot of dynamics throughout and is quite technical its very psycroptic sounding yet there are a lot of new sounds and ideas introduced just an all round cool track both to listen to and play lyrically the song explores the the idea of a suicidal god like being one who has omnipotence yet wants to relinquish it a twisted thought a being who has the choice to do anything desired except giving up such a power all powerful yet powerless at the same time
5892495 theres a really vibrant variety of filmmakers who are less well known to the public that are making experimental films documentary films shorts and the occasional medium sized narrative film
5892496 even though san francisco has not been bringing in a lot of big budget films theres a home grown industry here that the san francisco film society is looking to support with its new film makers services program

5892502 creation vs a whole heck of a lot of science
5892503 science is the human activity of seeking natural explanations for what we observe in the world around us
5892504 science is a systematic method of continuing investigation that uses observations hypothesis testing measurement experimentation logical argument and theory building to lead to more adequate explanations of natural phenomena
5892505 our classroom was turned into a newsroom and weve been reporting for the bbc school report collecting information for the website and six oclock news we started at 8 30am and we were still doing it at 4pm in the run up to today weve been doing stuff in our english lessons so we could learn how to write scripts and things then this morning we had to decide what stories we wanted to use christopher and his classmates discussed what stories they should use we chose stories about two british soldiers involved in a submarine crash the eu running more flights to america and children staying on at school until theyre 18 we decided that the airplane story was going to go first but then we got a new story about a criminal escaping so we had to move everything round and did that instead ive done lots of other things too including being a roving reporter for newsround i thought i was just going to be interviewed for the programme but i got to go around with the newsround crew describing what everyone else has been doing good experience ive also been typing up reports for bbc tv and weve made some websites as well its been fun looking at other peoples work and ideas and seeing how people do stuff its been a really good experience and its a good idea to let kids my age do this when you see the journalists on tv you dont realise how much goes on behind the scenes ive always wanted to be a lawyer or forensic scientist but i wouldnt mind doing this now
5892506 we had to design a rocket we had to try to get it to fly up to 850ft to stay in the air for 45 seconds and to take an egg as a passenger our rocket did really well it stayed up for about 50 seconds flew up to 556ft and the egg was intact click here to see pix of the rocket contest we made the rocket at our schools space club it was for a competition and the prize was a trip to washington dc and 1 000 we decided to enter and we got a programme where you could design a rocket about seven of us worked on it for four or five months we did it after school and in our lunch breaks it was quite hard because everything was so complicated but we had some help from experts five of us travelled down from bingley to the competition in surrey eighteen schools entered the competition and only eight were chosen to make the trip we had to put our rocket on the launch pad and put the key in and then there was a countdown then it took off i was a bit scared that it would crash or get broken so i was relieved when it was ok some of the teams here are sixth formers so were really pleased with our rocket its been lots of fun to meet different people i love space because its really interesting but im not sure what i want to do when i leave school ive got lots of time to decide
5892507 im 146cm tall and i weigh nine stone which is 57 kilos i started putting on weight when i was nine years old because i was bored and started eating too much i used to get bullied quite a lot at school so i used to come up to my bedroom and drink fizzy pop and eat chocolate and crisps i was really really sad and upset and i didnt want to tell anyone thomas ate junk food to cheer himself up when he was being bullied all the name calling got me really angry and upset and i realised i was getting out of breath and unhealthy lose the fat i had to do something about it so ive started going to a local club which helps obese children get fit and healthy again as well as doing exercises its taught me about healthy food and smaller portions and ive found that other children felt the same way as me
5892508 i go to netball club after school every monday afternoon in netball there are lots of positions you can play in so theres something for everyone i play centre which means i have to run around a lot my other position i like playing is wing defence at netball club we start off with a warm up then we normally play some fun games to help us with our passing after that we would play a match unbeaten this year we have played four matches all of which we have won or drawn i play in these matches so i wear a maroon bib with a big c on it i really enjoy playing netball and i would recommend it to all girls
5892509 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5892510 are you aware that claude pepper is known all over washington as a shameless extrovert not only that but this man is reliably reported to practice nepotism with his sister in law and he has a sister who was once a thespian in wicked new york worst of all it is an established fact that mr pepper before his marriage habitually practiced celibacy
5892511 the people had gathered around his dead body when the bomber blew himself up
5892512 accepted the responsibility for the blast and warned to carry out more such explosions if operations in swat and bajaur were not halted
5892513 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
5892514 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
5892515 if your article is a revise and resubmit then i think its ok to say that its under review at a specific journal if however its in the early stages of review i dont think it makes sense to list it as such i actually find it quite misleading when papers are listed under review at particular journals especially if the paper has only recently been sent out
5892516 i think it is an exceedingly bad idea to list where an article is under review on ones c v if a paper is an r amp r then listing it is as r amp r at a particular journal is fine id say the same about the university press if theres no contract dont name the press both of those things could look like one is padding and thats the very last thing you want a search committee to think
5892517 i would leave the name off if she doesnt get the contract there and she has talked up that press too much people will wonder why it didnt work out she should make it clear thru informal ways that it is getting positive feedback but i wouldnt mention the specific press on a cv or letter
5892518 i always advise against listing the place where something is under review who needs to know if you land at your second choice eventually
5892519 this is just my opinion as a many time mentor and a reader of appointment files i think it best just to provide the more general information under review university press article under review sometime people do say r amp r at a specific journal because that is a little more sure but not 100 of course while i dont think that people really pay that much attention you really wouldnt want to leave a paper trail of where a paper book was rejected my first academic publication was rejected 6 times before it finally appeared in the asr these academic works get rejected for any number of reasons but sometimes we tend to over analyze what it means to have had a paper that was under review at x journal why it came out in y journal much of this depends on your level of tolerance for uncertainty hope this is helpful
5892520 first why not list where the book is under review the fact that it is under review at all says that it is in fact a real ms and not just a promised one and if it is under review at a top tier press then it also shows that one is thinking about where to go and aiming high sounds good to me and in the case of an article under review it should definitely say where again this makes it clear that it really is under review one of the mistakes i see on cvs is a too long list of work in progress which i dont take to be real you cant be working on 7 things at once but having a trajectory that shows things at different stages is great so for instance one under review and where one being revised after review some smallish number in progress and if you can say that ms 1 will be submitted to journal a that also makes it sound more like it is really in progress thats how id set it up
5892521 yes a book manuscript under review is meaningful because it doesnt get to the point where the editor sends it out for review unless the editor is interested in the idea of publishing it so i would tell her to go ahead and list it i dont know about whether or not she should list where articles are under review lets face it an article under review doesnt mean much unless its an r amp r
5892522 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5892523 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5892524 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5892525 the home entertainment service market in spite of serving close to 120 million tv households for decades has still not delivered the quality choice and service experience leading to customer delight
5892526 there are only six million pay tv dth homes and this will grow ten times to 60 million by 2012 the market is likely to grow to 17 18 million in a year and we plan to have a 40 per cent share of this market at the end of 12 months
5892527 it is indeed an unfortunate development and we extend our full support to jade in this difficult hour she is a strong willed woman who has emerged victorious from many battles we sincerely hope she wins this time as well
5892528 life is so unpredictable and can so easily distract and derail you from your plans
5892529 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistamines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistamines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
5892530 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected
5892531 aiims is a renowned research institution the children must have died because they were already very ill
5892532 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded since january 1 2006
5892533 these include deaths both in the control and intervention groups
5892534 after a faculty review meeting of all available data we found that none of the deaths can be attributed to drugs
5892535 as the clinical trial market is increasing in india we have stipulated a separate provision in the bill to ensure that best practices are followed while conducting trials earlier we had guidelines on how trials need to be conducted soon we will have a law
5892536 no trials can be conducted without permission from the drugs controller general the provisions are presently being studied by the parliamentary standing committee once it approves and returns the bill we will place it again before parliament
5892537 with enough people and enough lawsuits like this the city will see a need to change policy
5892538 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of settlement at this time

5892542 we detected a missile launch from iran on august 16 and our reports indicated it was unsuccessful
5892543 it certainly didnt get very far off the ground and it definitely did not meet the overall objectives that the iranians reported the test achieved
5892544 is it a cool thing to say in this day and age that you love your country and youre fighting for the red white and blue
5892545 no were not going to say great things about america were going to admit were imperfect when were in berlin and were going to tell little seven year olds who ask me why i want to be president why because this country is not what it once was we are going to be critical of this country thats whats cool thats whats honest
5892546 the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race
5892547 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5892548 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5892549 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5892550 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5892551 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5892552 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
5892553 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
5892554 this indicates that they do learn from each other which is not a surprise really but it does also seem that they exhibit elements of what in humans we would call cultural behaviour
5892555 these are things that groups develop and are passed between individuals and that come to define those groups such as language or dancing and it would seem that among the port river dolphins we may have an incipient tail walking culture
5892556 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
5892557 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5892558 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5892559 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5892560 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5892561 one problem we have found at the nea is most people feel that businesses have not done anything about the environment it may not be true
5892562 businesses here are more conscious of the environment and part of its for pragmatic reasons if you consume what costs more its as basic as that
5892563 the approach for a small business should be no different from a household
5892564 just like managing a two man business or a sole proprietorship it should not be different from personal finance when it comes to a certain size your mindset should be no different from that of managing your own home
5892565 if you want change make it something easy for people to accept its like going ona diet if i say i will just have one meal a day it will be too difficult but if i cut 10 per cent of what i eat it will be manageable
5892566 i would like to champion during my term societal participation on environmental issues i may not succeed but i would like to see society take ownership of the issues at large
5892567 careful management and conservation of existing populations of musk oxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5892568 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
5892569 keeping large grazers in the picture will help maintain other components of the arctic as we know it or at least moderate the effects of global warming
5892570 not only are animals like caribou and musk oxen themselves affected by climate change they also affect how the arctic responds to climate change
5892571 for decades the arctic has been considered to be regulated bottom up
5892572 mammals have the potential to counteract effects of warming on arctic systems
5892573 it is true that herbivores are relatively few in number in the tundra compared with warmer areas but their effects can be intense
5892574 this could be a very important finding as some predictions of effects of the increased shrub cover are equivalent to doubling the atmospheric co2 again
5892575 using a really conservative estimate using the largest possible size of shark using a low fin to weight ratio thats still 10 000 sharks that would have needed to be killed for that amount of fin
5892576 start protecting places like osprey reef out in the coral sea one of the few places in the world where sharks come in large numbers they aggregate there
5892577 another key action that were calling for is that we want the queensland government to shelve its plans for creating a shark fishery literally in the great barrier reef world heritage area
5892578 currently theres around 1 400 licences that can be utilised to take shark in queensland waters the proposal is to reduce that to 200 licences and restrict the catch to a precautionary level of 700 tonnes
5892579 i want to be absolutely convinced on the basis of the material that comes to me that we can agree with the queensland government on a management plan that sees fisheries managed sustainably and which doesnt see impacts on fish species and an impact that has been reflected in the figures that have been released today
5892580 there was a whole change right through the ecosystem and the scallop fishery collapsed because with the loss of the sharks the rays increased dramatically and they ate all the scallops and so the fishery collapsed because of the fishery for sharks so you lost two fisheries
5892581 ecosystem effects can happen when you take out a top predator

5892583 they were both still alive but the bangladeshi worker had lost some of the fingers on one hand
5892584 musicians are role models and since our fans are all not from the same political party it is prudent not to show ones party affiliation at this time in our country where we are still nursing our democracy
5892585 musicians as members of the public have a right to belong to a political party and vote during election time but unlike the us where their democracy is 200 years old ghana is only 18 years and it would be unwise to liken ourselves to them absolutely
5892586 we need to stick to our unifying role as musicians in the interest of public peace
5892587 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5892588 in terms of disaster management you have to think about the worst case scenario first for example if people are aware of this possibility they will be prepared and will help their families and they will be safe
5892589 i have nowhere to go and i dont have relatives who live somewhere else if its only flooding its still okay for me but if its a major storm im worried it might destroy the whole house
5892590 the local government has given us no official warning about the storm surge but ive seen my neighbours starting to panic some have already moved
5892591 the target regime for local authorities must be changed so instead of a focus only on individuals waste priority is given to ensuring businesses are doing their bit to reduce waste an important step would be to introduce true individual producer responsibility for waste associated with a companys products so manufacturers who behave irresponsibly face financial consequences and those who are doing the right thing are supported
5892592 there is excessive packaging on a number of items chocolate biscuits easter eggs and so on and people should be alerted to the fact that this is not an efficient way for businesses to operate wasteful packaging was something we thought needs to be addressed
5892593 early sell by dates enables supermarkets to turn round their stock more quickly and they are obviously loathed to expose themselves to legal action if there is something wrong with their food
5892594 therefore perfectly good food may be thrown away because of a mixture of supermarkets being overly cautious and being keen to move stock along
5892595 this independent report highlights the failings of the government to tackle the vast amount of waste produced by businesses and the lamentable record of this government in helping firms increase their recycling labour ministers seem obsessed with hammering householders with heavy handed bin taxes bin fines and bin cuts despite the fact that domestic rubbish is a small fraction of the total amount that we throw away
5892596 such a change could lead to manufacturers adapting their business model to encourage more sustainable consumption amongst their customers
5892597 the committee looked at the growth of fast fashion and point out that the increased use of cheap fabrics for clothes intended to be worn for a short period of time and then thrown away makes recycling of fabric more difficult and is reflective of an increasing throwaway society
5892598 businesses need to match the efforts local people have made in recent years to reduce this countrys reliance on landfill it is unfair for them to profit at the taxpayers expense as councils are left to deal with the rubbish they create
5892599 reducing packaging is vital if we are to avoid paying more landfill tax and eu fines which could lead to cuts in frontline services and increases in council tax the days of the cling film coconut must come to an end we all have a responsibility to reduce the amount of waste being thrown into landfill which is damaging the environment and contributing to climate change
5892600 the landfill tax escalator specifically targets business and commerce as high waste producers we have a big programme of engagement with business and have invested over 650m in the last three years
5892601 my tech list is quite long i have a dslr compact camera laptop and pc i maximise my tech resources though i spend time on the computer but a lot of my activities online are dedicated to spreading the environmental message the whole idea is that youre not using technology for only fun things but for advocating environmentalism and conservation we cant reach out to many people with flyers and flyers leave a big carbon footprint too by using the computer and the internet to spread our message we increase awareness more easily so you can see it as justifying use of technology in a way with wi fi available in some of our parks we can instantly blog or twitter about what we see the other day i saw seven otters at pulau ubin and i sent a message to twitter my friends who saw it passed on the message also i try to turn everything off at the main supply at the end of the day instead of leaving gadgets on standby mode
5892602 tech gadgets can lead to waste and add to power consumption but in some cases they can also make you greener when i first got a pager i stopped buying watches as my pager could tell time now that i have a mobile phone i dont buy alarm clocks i also dont need an organiser because my phone tracks my appointments i think integration of a few devices into one has helped people become more green when gadgets become multifunctional you can replace a few gadgets with just one thats one of the advantages of technology if i buy a gadget next ill get a phone with a pda and also gps so i wont need a separate gps device for my nature treks also get things second hand it saves you money when my pc monitor died i got the next one through freecycle its a forum where people offer their old gadgets or anything else they dont want instead of throwing them away you should just buy what you need rather than buy what you want thats a green way to live a tech life

5892604 they no longer run the business as it is being liquidated they have been in the business for more than 20 years their family is here in malaysia and they have no reason to abscond
5892605 it saddens me that foreigners will not be able to play here in malaysia anymore but that is a decision made by the authorities so we have no choice but before i leave i would like to help kedah win the malaysia cup again
5892606 it will be a tough final any final is tough but kedah have been having a good run and the players are very motivated
5892607 they say success breeds success and that is what we have been achieving in kedah the last two seasons
5892608 our kedah foundation is good as we have many young players moving up the ranks and coach azraai khor has been doing a lot of work with the players i am sure no one expected us to come this far
5892609 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5892610 we are not setting any deadline but we are urging them to come forward as soon possible
5892611 investigations show most of them are from here but are working and living elsewhere we believe they left permatang pauh after the attack
5892612 we paid a heavy price for being over confident at the same time our goalkeeper was jittery
5892613 the penang island municipal council has been informed by the penang tourism action council that the funds have arrived they have until the end of the year to put up the signboards or the money has to be returned to tourism malaysia
5892614 on our part we have carried out research on the history of the streets we wish to highlight
5892615 we have been having this programme throughout the country for the past few years it is not a political gimmick to fish for votes
5892616 we want to show the public that puteri umno cares we have received encouraging response from villagers especially elders
5892617 this programme is popular older people find it tiring to go to the hospital so we go to them to offer medical aid
5892618 what about jesse mccartney you guys are on tour how is it being with him
5892619 he is actually really sweet he is really cool he sent me a bouquet of flowers the first show
5892620 you dont even have to answer i can see it in your eyes
5892621 after checking with both team and local hospital officials we figured he should no longer fight because it could threaten his life
5892622 i feel a little pressure i just try not to think about it
5892623 the gold is everyones goal because whoever wins it is going to be a star
5892624 i received my medal calmly because there werent huge expectations on me since i am a new and young member
5892625 when i read the article in the new straits times what moved me most was the boys bravery at the time of his accident and i wanted to help him regain his confidence
5892626 we were touched by the story as we are parents ourselves
5892627 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
5892628 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
5892629 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway
5892630 these changes are underway and there are more changes coming
5892631 after it is tabled to the cabinet an announcement will be made on our commitment to further preparations
5892632 this nuclear energy is vital following the increase in the world fuel price and our limited oil reserve moreover nuclear energy is cheap and clean

5892635 we hope that displaying carbon footprints will raise awareness among consumers as well as companies of their emissions and motivate them to emit less c02
5892636 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5892637 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5892638 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5892639 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt

5892645 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
5892646 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
5892647 we need a call to action not a call to go to another conference
5892648 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
5892649 the geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what youre effectively doing is pumping water below ground where its heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station
5892650 if you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the coast could be comparable to coal
5892651 if on the other hand youre talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central australia and then building large transmission lines to adelaide and sydney the costs are going to be too expensive
5892652 in theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and theyve got to move onto another field
5892653 then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field
5892654 what were primarily seeing is that there is an increase in vegetation in northern canada
5892655 areas that were normally occupied by herbs for example are becoming occupied by shrubs were seeing a migration of the tree line northwards these sorts of changes have implications on wildlife and the people who depend on wildlife in the north
5892656 its going to be like that for the next three too
5892657 were trying to play with a chip on our shoulder we go out every night and try to get better

5892660 we know argentina are a very experienced team we hope to have a little revenge because they knocked us out in the last olympic tournament in greece in our home
5892661 when you play a team like argentina the first thing no mistakes patience and try to have a clear mind on every pass and every time you defend
5892662 it will be a difficult game they have a lot of players that can change the game everyone of them that means we need a lot of concentration
5892663 meet the needs of a much larger but stabilizing human population sustain the life support systems of the planet and substantially reduce hunger and poverty
5892664 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5892665 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5892666 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5892667 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5892668 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5892669 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5892670 an extra 9 170 people now live in the salisbury council area compared to 2002 thats a big jump

5892675 i like writing books about women that people have never heard about these arent famous women these are women who had 15 minutes of unfortunate fame
5892676 it is a 19th century project about a politician in power it involves seduction and the woman wins

5892681 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5892682 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5892683 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5892684 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5892685 doe is committed to the development and commercial deployment of ngnp technology in a timely manner
5892686 nuclear energy is vital to our nations energy security and the ngnp has the potential to extend the benefits to bring nuclear technology to a whole new sector of the u s economy
5892687 the nrcs new reactor licensing process is currently focused on light water reactors and the staff is confident this basic framework can also support an ngnp review
5892688 we will work with doe to supplement that framework with ngnp specific items
5892689 the rule of law legal studies and the liberal arts
5892690 the world offers daily reminders not just of how fragile and tenuous the rule of law can be but that it cannot be legislated into existence
5892691 the institute aims to appreciate the rule of law at the level not only of statutes and constitutional documents but also of sensibility and imagination where and how does the idea of the rule of law originate in the western tradition
5892692 the institute will consider what it means to live under the rule of law in the united states and to foreground the conditions necessary for it to take hold and flourish

5892738 there are a number of surf breaks on the coast
5892739 i dont think people will be deprived of the ability to surf on those weekends just relocate
5892740 in perth they would have to share waves with hundreds
5892741 i know there is going to be a clash between recreational surfers when their favourite break is used
5892742 you can build a golf course or a swimming pool but you cant build an ocean artificial waves can be made but i doubt it would be done
5892743 the plates have been in high demand and we are pleased to have the opportunity to release some very low numbers
5892744 the shire is very happy with the process and the agreement with the lions club and we look forward to working with them in the future
5892745 having been involved in the silver chain auction i am very pleased to now be involved in the auction for the lions club
5892746 i was knocking on doors and windows but no one would let me in so i rang the bell the youth said at a christchurch district court depositions hearing today

5892752 six thousand dollars wont buy you very much rental space in margaret river considering its for one year
5892753 talk about sustainability but financial sustainability hasnt been their cup of tea
5892754 if you want to be able to be relevant you must go out and self fund your group
5892755 its up to you to go out there and obtain funds from your agencies so you are financially stable
5892756 i just hope the mrrec will do this as well and turn an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan
5892757 as kermit the frog said its not easy being green you cop quite a bit of flak when what youre trying to do is shift the goalposts
5892758 i think the original recommendation was a good one we could have office rental for a year we worked out we could do it for 8200
5892759 last week students from margaret river primary were given a special warning about the dangers of crossing the stretch of bussell highway outside the school following a potentially dangerous incident involving a student who ran across the road before cross walk attendants signalled
5892760 the idea of a diversion route was first raised 20 years ago as an option for directing heavy haulage traffic away from bussell highway
5892761 the government has been answering questions regarding this project over the last two terms of government and yet it still hasnt materialised into any form of real action
5892762 unfortunately the government has consistently failed to make a commitment to fund this important project or prioritise it in any of their 5 10 year plans
5892763 from the time i located my electorate office in margaret river in late 1997 to the election in february 2001 when we lost office i worked closely with the margaret river community to get the perimeter road approved and funded
5892764 we were close to the point of getting it included on main roads five year priority project list when the labor party came to power
5892765 the previous amr shire then lost interest and avoided the issue because they didnt support any development to the east of the town so the impetus slowed until about 2005 but the need has remained
5892766 the shire and community have been almost unanimous in the last three to four years that they wanted the project and wanted state labor government support but this has fallen on deaf ears
5892767 this is despite the fact that this project has close to unanimous community support as well as an unprecedented commitment by some of the larger landowners to contribute up to 50 per cent of the total cost of this important project
5892768 this did not really become an issue until the forest products commission began harvesting the mature trees in this area earlier this year as these trees were originally a feature of this entry point
5892769 the shire initiative of suggesting the planting of karri trees and other natural flora in this area has great merit and it deserves the support of the community and the state government
5892770 our support for this proposal relies on the shires careful planning and assessment process to define which piece of land the forest products commission can utilise as an alternative to the current site
5892771 given what i know of this proposal this should be an attractive deal for the fpc given the alternative sites selected by the shire are not only more suitable for a pine plantation but they also will offset any loss in productivity
5892772 further to this i understand the shire will be contributing to the rehabilitation of any alternative sites for pine planting
5892773 this initiative will not only be an asset to the natural environment but it will also build on the strengths of this town as a tourism hotspot
5892774 in addition to this it will complement the rails to trails network which currently borders this site and is a great asset to this area
5892775 a r ssia o nico lugar em que posso viver
5892776 aqui eu tenho liberdade completa e quem pode valoriz la melhor do que eu
5892777 mas um ferimento est sangrando em meu cora o um aceno feito de amor e dio a esta grande incr vel pisada imortal desejada e muito esperada terra
5892778 is this the one that i can make a pow reference about
5892779 is this a touch screen if i push that button what will it do
5892780 would do justice to the exceptional location it currently sits on
5892781 few people could argue that the present park is anything but sub standard and does nothing to enhance the image of the town as a desireable holiday destination
5892782 however as always when there is a proposal to improve infrastructure and in turn improve the economy up pop the unelected and unrepresentative vocal minority to attempt to stop any progress for augusta
5892783 in this case there are semi permanent residents who have been living in prime locations for years at cheap rental who now want to stop any improvements alter their lifestyle thus keeping it as a third rate camping ground to hell with the greater need
5892784 augusta despite all the hoopla about the booming wa economy will become an economic basket case unless there are jobs for the people and in particular the 200 children who live in and around augusta
5892785 the time has come for these people to accept that change is inevitable and work with the community to do what is best for augusta and its future
5892786 several locations that could be sold have been identified but by far the most contentious is the parcel of land adjoining donovan street
5892787 plans for development of that land have been in existence for many years but there is considerable resistance in the community to have any form of development on that site it being referred to as augustas kings park by some of the more vocal opponents
5892788 the shire are reviving the plans for some development at donovan street so there should some interesting debates in the near future regarding this highly emotive issue
5892789 youll wonder where the yellow went when you brush your teeth with pepsodent

5892808 the possibility of widespread social distress and even political instability
5892809 dismal economic conditions also foster forces of discontent that potentially could turn against the kim regime especially if knowledge of the luxurious lifestyle of becomes better known or as poor economic performance hurts even the elite
5892810 the only significant power base that might challenge the regime is the military since kim jong il became chairman of the national defense commission however he has promoted 230 generals most of the armys 1 200 strong general officer corps owes their allegiance to him

5893051 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5893052 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5893053 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5893054 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5893055 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is

5893057 rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job

5893090 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it

5893092 i was thinking of all the ways the tent would be awful i went right to it no prototype

5893095 its like having an entire extra day at burning man you can go to bed at 3 or 4 in the morning get up at noon and youre still human at the end of the week
5893096 i felt a bit removed and also maybe a little bit common because so many people do that
5893097 they told me it would take a little over an hour to set up and one person could do it
5893098 it took two people and three hours but once i got it up i couldnt believe it it was so absolutely bomber

5893104 who have been setting up in certain areas and certain places saying they are representing the family and theyre not family

5893128 se trata de una plaga que como no se la conoce no se tiene conocimiento tampoco de cu ndo comenz a distribuirse en la zona pero su dispersi n es asombrosa desde enero a julio de este a o que venimos realizando un monitoreo en plantaciones de entre r os es impresionante la expansi n y cantidad detectada incluso en plantaciones de eucalipto de buenos aires
5893129 realmente me asust del da o que causa y fue entonces que a mi regreso decidimos realizar m s trampas hablamos con productores y comenzamos a detectar m s plantaciones afectadas
5893130 es una plaga invasora muy nueva tiene una capacidad de producci n importante ataca a las hojas en principio a ejemplares maduros con rboles trampas hubo una dispersi n alarmante y en el pa s no tenemos un controlador es decir no tiene enemigos naturales y hay que trabajar en ello
5893131 cuando la poblaci n de chinches es alta produce una fuerte reducci n en la tasa fotosint tica de las hojas pudiendo llegar a darse defoliaci n parcial o total del rbol los rboles pueden recuperarse con una nueva brotaci n
5893132 es importante la participaci n de la mayor cantidad de productores posibles por lo que se agradecer a todos lo que puedan responder simplemente completando las preguntas que se plantean en la web del inta concordia
5893133 and i just think it is really important for boards to unanimously support levies

5893136 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5893137 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5893138 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5893139 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5893140 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5893141 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5893142 weve got to work with the business sector to try and get carbon capture and storage in place because 80 per cent of our electricity in australia at the moment is currently by coal fired power stations he said
5893143 to see it in real life and that it exists its just its just unbelievable it really is
5893144 to think back and i made up a character you know and just made it up but suddenly a man came named henry winkler and he made this character real
5893145 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration

5893149 we americans need a renaissance of biblically based education that draws upon american christian heritage and history which will produce strong christian character and a consistent biblical worldview in its students for generations to come the principle approach is that kind of education
5893150 americans need to rediscover their splendid christian heritage and citizens of every nation need to know the profound biblical principles of peace freedom and order and how they can be taught in homes churches and schools because the foundation and the principle approach has such a great potential to help meet these urgent needs i give it my heart felt endorsement
5893151 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house

5893161 once i injured the ankle in trials i knew what lay in store still instead of backtracking i decided to give it a go after all this is olympics and i have put in a lot of efforts just for this occasion
5893162 but i guess once you injure your take off ankle you really dont have anything to do
5893163 no this is the first time that i hurt it its not a strain or twist but i hurt the joint and just could not take off and it only aggravated when the qualifying round started i could neither run nor take off gt
5893164 probably it was not great but then i did not go full throttle all i wanted to do was to peak at the right time and give my best where it matters most unfortunately my ankle held me back
5893165 this is such a huge disappointment for me i came here in great shape and the cut mark 6 75 for the final looked well within reach but somehow it was not to be today
5893166 it is quite a relief to have that behind us
5893167 it is time consuming this allows us to focus on the job at hand which is the education of the students of this community
5893168 esta no ser una fecha m s aqu va a haber mucha lucha el aut dromo se encuentra espectacular estoy seguro que se va a dar un gran espect culo

5893174 the outraged women of mount isa felt that the mayors comments were archaic and it is totally not the image that we want to project for our city
5893175 we cant stand for this we need to get out there and say you need to go
5893176 they will have to do more than call for my resignation
5893177 i wont be resigning because im quite comfortable with what i said
5893178 mount isa my city has taken the olympic games off the front page of papers all over australia and the world and ive never heard of that happening before
5893179 people have supported me everywhere and at the moment i feel like im sitting on the top of mount kosciusko
5893180 i thought it was very degrading for the city and for someone in public office he shouldnt be speaking in such terms
5893181 hemos decidido promover este vinculo de comunicaci n geogr fica ya que hemos notado que el mismo mejora la relaci n comercial con nuestro pa s hermano acrecienta los flujos tur sticos provenientes de esta regi n descomprime el tr nsito en el puente de la amistad y potencia la relaci n comercial del mercosur
5893182 la empresa de colectivos el pr ctico ya comenz los tr mites por orden del legislativo y el ejecutivo para llevar adelante este proyecto todo est en marcha como para concretarlo en los pr ximos meses el gobernador conoce el proyecto porque tiene la carpeta en su poder ser a importante que apoye la moci n agilizando los tramites para el pase de los colectivos en la balsa
5893183 todos sabemos que la conexi n de una balsa entre dos pa ses es el paso previo a la tan anhelada concreci n de un puente de car cter internacional es muy importante en una regi n aceitar los canales de comunicaci n ya que el predominio regional de un pa s como sucede con brasil no es bueno para el desarrollo sustentable y equilibrado de un mercado y es a su vez impedimento de intercambios y monedas nicas en el futuro de un rea de libre comercio
5893184 con este intercambio pol tico econ mico tur stico y regional pretendemos incrementar la estad a de los turistas en iguaz tambi n en la zona paraguay est n los saltos monda la reserva bertoni y la ciudad de puerto franco que es una de las m s antiguas pensamos que se puede potenciar este circuito para ofrecerlo a los turistas que llegan a las cataratas y aumentar as el pernocte
5893185 para ellos tambi n este canal de comunicaci n es una alternativa muy interesante
5893186 ellos tienen la firme idea de impulsar este sector tur stico en donde se encuentra el hito de las tres fronteras en franco y para eso est n poniendo plata y muchas obras
5893187 pensamos que as se reactivar a el transporte fluvial y le dar amos vida al puerto m s importante de paraguay que es franco estos puertos formar an parte del circuito fluvial que reactivar a esa zona hay que pensar que tenemos un mill n de turistas por a o y con esto se armar a un circuito tur stico y adem s se beneficiar a al transporte de personas de la regi n tambi n para tal fin se utilizar un catamar n de unas 40 personas m s o menos que partir de puerto libertad
5893188 es de destacar que tanto prefectura como migraciones y la aduana coinciden con nuestro proyecto
5893189 diez por ciento de los agricultores quiere volcarse a producir alimentos
5893190 m s de 2 000 carpetas para el programa prov alimentos 2 000 carpetas implican en torno al diez por ciento de los agricultores de nuestra provincia no es un n mero menor estamos rompiendo un mito estamos instalando de una vez por todas en la cabeza de los misioneros que podemos producir alimentos no es poca cosa rompimos el mito de la ganader a y ya somos una provincia ganadera y podemos ser productores de cuantos alimentos se nos ocurra
5893191 venimos a conceptualizar el compromiso que tenemos con este plan de prova alimentos misioneros que busca como objetivo el autoabastecimiento de nuestra provincia que es ya una gran oportunidad porque gran cantidad de lo que nosotros consumimos lo traemos de afuera y en algunas cosas porqu no tambi n transformarnos en productores y en generadores de ventas a otras provincias y a otros pa ses en este caso esto para nosotros tiene algo de sabor emblem tico porque es la producci n de miel una de las primeras en las que estamos alcanzando el autoabastecimiento y estamos saliendo al pa s y al mundo
5893192 en este caso damos un salto m s en el concepto fundamental de agregaci n de valor mil cuatrocientas familias se incorporaron a este proceso a lo largo de estos a os se llev adelante la construcci n de las salas de extracci n y ahora s con este nuevo emprendimiento buscamos llegar con el producto final a los distintos mercados se decidi que sea en ap stoles yo pregunt porqu me parec a por el conocimiento que por ah tengo de log stica que ser a bueno que est en el centro de la provincia y me dicen no la idea es precisamente salir de la provincia entonces hacemos todo en ap stoles y ah ya estamos camino a buenos aires a santa fe a rosario a c rdoba me pareci llamativo me pareci ambicioso me pareci so ador y por eso dije es buena la idea estamos ac entregando estos 330 000 pesos que van a ser 660 000 pesos que los ponemos en manos de las cooperativas que esperamos y queremos que los administren bien que esto sea sustentable en el tiempo
5893193 el estado tiene y hay pruebas en cada uno de nuestros actos un gran compromiso con el sector cooperativo pero el compromiso no puede ser infinito cada cooperativa debe ser sustentable por s misma en el tiempo y debe autofinanciarse y crecer y debe incorporar tecnolog a y capacidades humanas no sirve de nada que dependa siempre del estado
5893194 s el estado da en este caso algo fundamental que es el primer impulso la primera inversi n de no poca plata bastante plata luego cuando funcione debe ser rentable y esa rentabilidad debe ser la m s alta para repartirse en las 1 400 o cuantas miles de familias se incorporen a este proceso
5893195 dec a un dato el ministro que en estos d as termina de organizar un buen banco de datos de las m s de 2 000 carpetas que se han presentado para el programa prov alimentos 2 000 carpetas implican en torno al diez por ciento de los agricultores de nuestra provincia no es un n mero menor estamos rompiendo un mito estamos instalando de una vez por todas en la cabeza de los misioneros que podemos producir alimentos no es poca cosa rompimos el mito de la ganader a y ya somos una provincia ganadera y podemos ser productores de cuantos alimentos se nos ocurra a m me da placer ir por las rutas y ver c mo las huertas empiezan a aparecer al lado de las casas siempre pongo como ejemplo dos casos uno en dos de mayo en la ruta 211 una chacra que aprovecha cada cent metro cuadrado de la tierra entre la yerba la mandioca la huerta pegada al lado el anan los c tricos todo junto se ve al costado del camino el otro es un ranchito que casi se cae en san ignacio y tiene su huerta al lado siempre lo digo eso hace poco tiempo que se empieza a ver y nosotros tenemos 2 000 intenciones y ojal cuando hagamos n meros tengamos los recursos las carpetas est n bien presentadas y esas 2 000 intenciones se transformen en 2 000 compromisos asumidos por el estado provincial yo les tengo mucha fe porque creo que si nos manejamos en una evoluci n del mundo en la que la crisis de alimentos se va a profundizar mucho de nuestra soberan a y de nuestra calidad de vida va a depender de que nosotros tengamos el autoabastecimiento
5893196 hay dos elementos que hist ricamente han sido problemas para nuestra provincia que se est n transformando en oportunidades estos dos elementos son primero la ubicaci n geogr fica geopol tica de misiones que durante a os nos provoc el aislamiento y hoy pareciera ser que a la integraci n latinoamericana nadie la puede parar y nosotros vamos a tener muchos beneficios de esto por eso ocupa gran parte de mi agenda la vinculaci n con distintos mandatarios de paraguay de brasil y de donde fuera en esta idea de transformar a misiones en el coraz n del mercosur en segunda instancia el esquema de minifundios en la provincia de misiones la estructura de peque as chacras que para muchos pudo parecer un problema y que incluso se han escrito libros sobre esta cuesti n y se han dictado leyes en este sentido hoy nos puede permitir llevar adelante estos peque os emprendimientos de producci n de nueces de miel de horticultura de frutas de lecher a y que nos presenta una gran oportunidad
5893197 no vamos a tener miles y miles de hect reas de soja pero vamos a tener miles y miles de hect reas de frutas de verduras de pasturas de todo lo que signifiquen alimentos para nuestra querida provincia y para exportar al mundo y al pa s
5893198 nunca le decimos a nadie que abandone los cultivos tradicionales bajo ning n punto de vista y no lo vamos a decir s le decimos que si al yerbal se le puede implantar algo hay que hacerlo nadie concibe desaprovechar algo que puede ser productivo nadie en ning n lugar la rotaci n es clave en la pampa h meda nosotros no podemos rotar la yerba pero s podemos agregar otros productos la apicultura es ideal para eso pero as tambi n otras actividades

5893203 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party

5893269 petrol for everyone era was over and that nuclear energy was more than ever a sustainable industry and an indispensable energy
5893270 how many accidents need to happen before authorities get it through their heads that there is no such thing as a safe nuclear facility
5893271 unfortunately those hurt in these accidents join an already crowded history of contaminated communities lands and waters that will dog the nuclear industry for a very long time into the future
5893272 a guaranteed safe nuclear facility is as realistic as a flying pig

5893284 its just fundamentally ineffective in terms of improving school discipline
5893285 it doesnt teach kids why what they did was wrong it doesnt show them better behavior what it does is teach them to be violent
5893286 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it

5893288 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5893289 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5893290 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5893291 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5893296 reputation is what other people know about you honor is what you know about yourself
5893297 there is no more hollow feeling than to stand with your honor shattered at your feet while soaring public reputation wraps you in rewards thats soul destroying the other way round is merely very very irritating
5893298 guard your honor let your reputation fall where it will and outlive the bastards
5893299 this is a new trend within the global food crisis
5893300 the food crisis gave alarms for all countries to look for places to secure supplies of agricultural goods
5893301 the importers are nervous and they have realised that they had better have a stake in countries with potential for agriculture exports
5893302 the uae is looking at implementing some agricultural projects in kazakhstan as part of its efforts to develop stable food sources for its needs
5893303 but now fertile land with access to water has become a strategic asset
5893304 we told them the saudis that we would be very eager to provide hundreds of thousands of hectares of agricultural land for investment
5893305 this is a situation that could bring real benefits to people in some developing countries but to be sustainable land purchase or lease arrangements must benefit and be seen to benefit all parties including citizens of the host country local communities and investors
5893306 joint venture agreements between on the one hand those countries that have the financial resources and on the other those that possess land water and human resources
5893307 some negotiations between host countries and the investors have led to unequal international relations and short term mercantilist agriculture
5893308 we are talking about some host countries where there is widespread poverty and hunger and we must ensure that the local populations share fully in the benefits of these initiatives

5893325 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5893326 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5893327 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002
5893328 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5893329 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

5893333 a person of substance would have presented himself to his fellow leaders among the pacific island countries to account for the undertaking he gave to them
5893334 what he has done is chicken out of that and i dont think that the leaders across the region will respond to that positively
5893335 the challenge for pacific countries is to have a united front on the question of fiji and to apply maximum political and diplomatic leverage on bainimaramas regime
5893336 i use the word regime because its not a democratically elected government and were not accustomed not to have democratically elected governments

5893339 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5893346 most people in this world spend their time comparing themselves to other people they focus on their own flaws and weaknesses and think the grass is always greener next door they drench their entire existence within those limitations and thus never live out their full potential they end up settling for far less than what they are actually capable of the funny thing about self confidence is that as elusive and as sought after as it is it is actually something that can be learned quite simply enter the law of cause amp effect

5893364 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5893365 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5893366 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5893367 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5893368 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5893369 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5893370 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5893371 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5893375 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5893376 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5893377 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5893378 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5893379 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up

5893396 would mr rogers your hero hold the opinions you have about marriages and careers
5893397 mr rogers has never argued that career and marriage are incompatible for women therefore he must believe that they are compatible

5893416 i saw st peters a great crowd of men was trying to pull it down whilst others constantly built it up again lines connected these men one with another and with others throughout the whole world i was amazed at their perfect understanding
5893417 the demolishers mostly apostates and members of different sects broke off whole pieces and worked according to rules and instructions they wore white aprons bound with blue riband in them were pockets and they had trowels stuck in their belts the costumes of the others were various
5893418 there were among the demolishers distinguished men wearing uniforms and crosses they did not work themselves but they marked out on the wall with a trowel where and how it should be torn down to my horror i saw among them catholic priests whenever the workmen did not know how to go on they went to a certain one in their party he had a large book which seemed to contain the whole plan of the building and the way to destroy it they marked out exactly with a trowel the parts to be attacked and they soon came down they worked quietly and confidently but slyly furtively and warily i saw the pope praying surrounded by false friends who often did the very opposite to what he had ordered
5893419 binding myself by no less penalty than that of having my throat cut from ear to ear my tongue torn out by its roots and buried in the sands of the sea

5893427 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business
5893428 the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

5893431 while the discourse of kokusaika promotes anglicization it also reinforces cultural nationalism through constructing a rigid cultural boundary between us and them
5893432 these observations manifest the native speaker myth the idealization of a native speaker as someone who has perfect innate knowledge of the language and culture and thus is the best teacher of english cf amin 1999 auerbach 1993 canagarajah 1999b phillipson 1992 rampton 1990 the native speaker myth also entails a perceived superiority of the inner circle particularly north american and british varieties of english matsuda 2000 documented high school students perceptions that american english is pure and authentic in contrast to their lack of interest in and knowledge of the outer circle varieties of english this tendency also parallels what kachru 1997 found in the english language curriculum of fifteen universities in japan a heavy focus on american and british white middle class literary canons compared with a scarcity of works by ethnic minority writers in these and other countries
5893433 an ethnographic study by matsuda 2000 demonstrated that japanese high school students most often described english as cool or fashionable with their overwhelmingly positive impression of the english language for many of her interviewees foreign countries meant the west i e north america and europe with the most frequent reference made to the usa this in part seems to reflect the conception that equates foreign language with english and indicates that foreign language teaching in japan distances itself from the rich linguistic and cultural diversity existing in schools and local commununities

5893444 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5893445 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
5893446 we expect continued supply issues but the situation is definitely getting better
5893447 its a hard game for them to play trying to predict how many phones they are going to sell and ultimately they are going to say its a good problem for them but we say it would be better not to have that problem at all
5893448 we have been quickly selling all the supplies we get
5893449 they have been using best buy pretty extensively with the macintosh

5893452 they are just having trouble figuring out where to put those things

5893475 i have a couple of buddies in iraq right now and i dont want them coming home to the same problems i had to face
5893476 some of these veterans are truly more afraid of going to college than they were of going to iraq
5893477 given what they have been through they have a very low tolerance for that sort of thing
5893478 the war is not over for them when they come home
5893479 its playing over and over in their minds society seems oblivious to that
5893480 one of the most important things we do is give them a place to get together with people who understand their feelings

5893526 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5893527 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5893528 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5893529 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5893530 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5893531 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5893532 weve got to work with the business sector to try and get carbon capture and storage in place because 80 per cent of our electricity in australia at the moment is currently by coal fired power stations he said
5893533 i am very happy to become vietnamese the new citizenship will help me greatly in my career and maybe national football as well
5893534 i have been living and working in vietnam for six years i think my decision was the right one even though it was very difficult
5893535 my parents support my decision when i return to brazil in the future i will be a guest not a citizen of the country that has held the world cup championship five times
5893536 i myself felt that vietnam and its people are close friendly and aggressive with football like brazilians that stimulated me to make the serious decision
5893537 i started the documentation process last year sometimes i felt sad because i had to give up my brazilian citizenship but my becoming vietnamese is gods idea
5893538 this is good for me if i am vietnamese i will receive more advantages as a local player on the team i want my club to be number one in vietnam
5893539 my vietnamese name is partly taken from the names of two players phan van tai em and phan van giau whom are exemplary players in both training and daily life
5893540 it is a good sign not only for my club but also vietnamese football the national coaches will have more choice for the goalie position the tall santos will help the vietnamese defence resolve their difficulty with high balls if he is chosen for the national team
5893541 santos is the best goalie in vietnam at the moment and his chance of being called for the national team is very high
5893542 the decision is of great significance to the future of vietnamese football because it means more international players will be given citizenship
5893543 we have known santos for a long time but now we are really happy to have a friendly foreign vietnamese teammate i hope he will be happy in his second home country
5893544 i expect to play with santos on the national team at the 2008 aff cup dong tam will help him overcome the challenges and contribute his best to vietnamese football
5893545 in becoming a vietnamese citizen i plan to contribute to the development of vietnams football and to a more professional and successful dong tam club
5893546 if im lucky to have good health i think i can play football at least five years more in the v league or even 15 years
5893547 im 30 and my football career is still ahead of me but im also working on my dream of establishing a goalkeeper training centre there is nothing like that in vietnam now so why i dont apply my skills and talents to this interesting job
5893548 as a professional player playing on the national team has always been a burning dream for me im awaiting the day when i wear the national teams jersey which is also an important reason for my decision to become vietnamese
5893549 i know it is very difficult but it will be my honour to play for vietnam
5893550 he may be selected for the national team it depends on his performance in v league as well as point of view of the national coaches in my opinion with a height of 1 98m 6 feet 5 we can have peace of mind in our defence
5893551 there is emerging consensus that both the incidence and prevalence of breast implant rupture are much higher than previously suspected
5893552 to the lowest ta c tics by dredging up a private matter from years ago just 21 days before an election
5893553 while a teachers responsibility is to teach more important as well is their responsibility to help students respond to them
5893554 a students obligation is to think about what has been taught to assess and to analyze the worthiness of the teachings they also need to show a genuine interest in the dharma and to be open minded that is not to hold onto preconceived ideas and concepts that impedes spiritual enquiry
5893555 some teachers may be able to dispense with deep teachings we need not however be overly concerned with whether the person has realized the teachings he or she is giving or not if the explanation of the teachings is unsatisfactory we need not expose the deficiency of the teacher because of the possibility of a misinterpretation as long as the teachings does not contradict ethics we should continue to have faith in his or her spiritual ability
5893556 its a like a cook you know a good cook would never say that he or she is a good cook the judgment sits on the onus of those who eats the food
5893557 in tibetan buddhism it is forbidden to talk about ones attainment
5893558 if what the teacher says clearly cannot match the deed with words then we have to be cautious for instance if a teachers talks about compassion but gets angry ever so often then we have to be aware of the manner which is contrary to the teaching
5893559 the spiritually health of a relationship is only useful when the mutual dependence of one another succeeds in positive mental engagement what this means is that when students sincerely listens to the teachings and puts them into practice some will find their life become more meaningful as a result their respect for the teacher increases
5893560 the ability of a skilled spiritual master to unlock the
5893561 you can say that most people expects this to be the end result of a master apprentice affiliation but this can only happen if the students can relate to the teachings in an uplifting way
5893562 when the students becomes so much attached to the teacher that instead of fermenting spiritual ties the relationship degenerates into jealousy with each student studiously looking out at who is getting more attention from the teacher
5893563 i spoke earlier of the need for students to have the ability to assess and to analyze situations
5893564 teachers too need such qualities to avoid falling into the charismatic trap newcomers to buddhism especially in the west are often people who needs emotional support more than spiritual guidance some hope to fill this void by trying to look deeply within themselves depending on someone to help them along the way others however tries to fulfill their spiritual emptiness by looking for someone or something to worship they carry their idolatry tendencies that is worshipping movie stars politicians and sports celebrity into the religious realms
5893565 by all means students must remember that all the training they receive only has one ultimate aim and that is to become an evolved individual which has the ability to help sentient beings if their end goal is to be dedicated only to the teacher and only to caring and helping the teacher they inevitably fall into the guru devotion dilemma this is by all account
5893566 a spiritual misnomer because the final destiny of a teacher student relationship is the mutual spiritual enrichment of both parties
5893567 when a teacher reprimands a student and the student returns with a serene look you know that the spiritual bond is strong and the practice is firm the ego does not run away but when the two do part the world is better for it because now there is one more to save sentient beings
5893568 age is just mind over matter if you dont mind it dont matter

5893595 hes beginning to lose all credibility with these veto threats

5893598 the veto is always there its the paddle on the wall

5893678 well what did she expect she married a military man
5893679 90210 and i am stoked about the new version finally coming out i am going to miss dylan and donna but i will give this new version a try
5893680 90210 is not enough evidence to make a buying decision
5893681 do we want a new direction rooted in historical american values or one that might be described as aberrational that is unusual in which we attack countries that havent attacked us in which we lay plans for long term occupation of a land where america and the west are deeply resented
5893682 its time for a change and that change needs to come quickly

5893687 you get to spend the entire day in bed and everyone waits on you its like being on vacation
5893688 you should have listened to god when he told you couldnt have kids
5893689 well admit you tonight well run some tests on you and well figure out exactly whats wrong the hospital is the best place to do that its a lot more efficient than you driving around every day to doctors and labs and waiting weeks for answers

5893695 what you do between now and then is entirely up to you
5893696 the numbers of people responding is much less than anticipated
5893697 the contacts i have across the major accountancy firms indicate that just a few hundred people have actually notified the revenue that there is tax to pay
5893698 we are not doing any counting exercises but we have a steady response
5893699 our web page has received more than 20 000 hits
5893700 people have another full month and we are expecting a deluge in the final few days
5893701 for many there is not much of an incentive here to come forwards

5893708 we are probably the ones that will have to cover the cost of mr mcgintys smoking police i cant imagine him setting up a special police force to enforce it
5893709 we used to handle roads rates and rubbish and now we are doing lots of things the state government used to do
5893710 i do support it because i think that rather than individual councils having the responsibility so you dont know what the situation is between say leederville and fremantle its consistent for people
5893711 you cant have officers walking up and down cappuccino strips and policing it we havent got the resources to add to staff to police these things
5893712 what you have to do is ban it and hope that people respect it and that owners of businesses have a mind to respect it

5893734 we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5893735 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect

5893752 do i have to pay child support when my child goes to college if i live in new hampshire
5893753 yeah you do because my sisters dad is going to have to pay for college when she goes
5893754 you have to pay child support until they are done college this uasually sic is standard i am pretty sure that you only have to pay for only 4 years of college or university

5893758 all im doing and all ive done for the last 30 years is find things that are taken too seriously and expose them in a comedic fashion
5893759 who wouldve thought airplane disaster movies would be material for jokes before airplane or serious westerns would be funny until blazing saddles
5893760 my motivations have always been to first ask where can i find good jokes
5893761 even though we are dealing with some serious subjects we repeatedly remind the audience you are watching a comedy
5893762 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
5893763 youve got the whole world on a string dont you
5893764 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
5893765 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5893766 these children have a very serious infection that is causing tissue necrosis the death of the tissue
5893767 its not like it is in older children and adults where its generally an invasive group a strep but indeed it is a necrotizing tissue destroying infection that theyve got
5893768 the review has not in any way turned up anything that would cause concern for mothers to be and the lethbridge region
5893769 if we had any concerns that there was something related to the hospital its dr mustos responsibility to shut the hospital down
5893770 in this particular incidence weve not been able to uncover the source of the infection
5893771 because its such an unusual event that there is two of these children that have such a significant infection we thought it wise to ask for another review of this and this is normal practice
5893772 because of the privacy act we need a formally signed consent form from the parents to release any information about the condition of the children
5893773 we dont have that and i dont think were going to be getting it
5893774 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5893775 i may not have had led the most exciting life but the things i have done in my life have been enough i have been happy and loved and anything extra would be just that extra

5893780 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5893781 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
5893782 the only word they could say in english was accident
5893783 there were 10 or 15 of them with blood pouring from wounds to their heads arms and bodies it was a shocking sight
5893784 the accident occurred in a very difficult area to access with the coach ending up on its side down a steep embankment which hampered rescue attempts
5893785 it just sounded like a clap of thunder i saw the coach flying through the garden and just dialled 999

5893787 only you can change the way you think and feel about things its definitely hard and shitty to change though everyone is human everyone has faults and everyone makes mistakes there will be bad things there will be bad people and bad experiences but you cant let that get to you too much remember that with humanity also comes beautiful things everyone is different but at the same time they are the same there is so much potential in life like youve got your photography and shit you really have talent there i love seeing your work its inspirational and i admire you for that you just have to acknowledge the good in life and all the potential it comes with and grab that potential and take advantage of it own it own life

5893831 someone in my office loud of voice and dim of wit asked rhetorically on friday last what russian wanted by its invasion of georgia like most of the morons working here they never read the reports that abound so i took the trouble to tell them what the russians want
5893832 we are now in a fight against the great russia
5893833 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own

5893837 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5893838 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop

5893842 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5893843 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5893844 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5893845 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5893846 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5893847 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5893848 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5893849 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5893850 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5893851 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5893852 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5893853 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles

5893865 the consensus to reject michael phelps extraordinary athleticism is a decision based on the politics of racial inequalities that exist outside of sport rather than talent training and ability

5893867 over phelps communities are currently saying their pick is jamaicas usain bolt
5893868 let us remember that white people wouldnt do right by blacks out of natural love but only modified their treatment of us because of how their hatred made them look before the rest of the world
5893869 they wouldnt demonstrate their pretense of treating black people with basic human and civil rights until there were laws put into affect
5893870 even having been taught love by martin luther king they wouldnt do it just for the sake of love

5893873 w hile they dismiss this as a result of too much sun exposure and unrelated to spirituality we know otherwise there is no such thing as too much sun exposure and divinity no longer accepts them as a part of nature
5893874 the suns rays which they call ultraviolet a and ultraviolet b rays damage white peoples skin eyes amp brains and lead to early wrinkles skin cancers and mental disorders
5893875 due to their poor ability to re adapt to the current minor shifts in the environment without high susceptibilities to skin cancers like squamous and basal cell carcinomas melanomas and cataracts the long term affects of global warming and ozone depletion negatively impact the fair skinned moreso than those with darker pigments
5893876 their toxins are not responsible for the openings in the ozone layer fashioning
5893877 they can not see the kind of monsters they are but gods poetic justice is shown in that

5893879 like everything weve done it started small but we got foot souljas in every state and every soulja got a mouth all we did across the network was say we wearing nooses on september 22nd within three days we received enthusiastic reponses from brothers all across america
5893880 if blacks want to run around in nooses on september the 22nd well fill in the gaps and really give em something to think about
5893881 i dont have a problem making a whole bunch of black dummies stuffing them with newspaper hanging them from trees and then setting them on fire in fact i cant think of anything id like to do more
5893882 we dont want a better america we want this county with a different name and without white people
5893883 white people lost their rights to this land we are going to see to it that every nigga in savannah is wearing a noose on the 22nd and we gonna shake our tails in the devils face

5893912 but runescape is child oriented with some players as young as five online
5893913 other skills are primarily for earning money runescape gold so the character can buy needed items for further advancement
5893914 these factors combined with jagex child directed advertising and efforts to make the game more user friendly have resulted in millions of kids signing on to play runescape this influx has in turn led to many experienced players and adults losing interest in the game and moving on which lowers the average age of gamers further creating a self reinforcing cycle that pushes the average age of runescape gamers steadily downwards
5893915 runescape is nominally a role playing game but very few players actually take on the role of a character and well role play it most just focus on obtaining items wealth and power
5893916 there are no consequences for walking into a town for example and just slaughtering every townsperson you find in most places cutting down a guard in front of another guard wont even cause the second to take notice
5893917 something else is motivating him to write such a scathing article

5893922 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5893923 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5893924 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5893925 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5893926 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5893927 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5893928 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5893929 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5893930 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5893931 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5893932 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5893933 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5893934 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5893935 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5893936 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5893937 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5893938 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5893939 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5893940 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5893941 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5893942 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5893943 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5893944 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5893945 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees

5893954 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
5893955 we live in a post christian world what this means is that christianity is no longer the dominant narrative nor does it shape what the world thinks like in previous centuries to remain relevant christianity must find ways to place itself in the rhythms of the world or better to beckon the world to the rhythms of the christian way
5893956 if you use biblical arguments to justify your political and geographical rights you are making god the granter of your arguments and there is no way for any concession
5893957 just work 40 hours a week and come home at the end of the day

5893960 i will either not sell or clearly state that it is not
5893961 this is all quite uplifting on its surface but in attempting to hit the requisite highlights of an inspiring biography director george tillman jr soul food reduces brashears achievement to a succession of clich s forcing gooding and de niro to battle sentiment with their noteworthy performances as sundays neglected wife charlize theron is completely extraneous hal holbrooks diving school commander is a ranting caricature and newcomer aunjanue ellis barely registers as brashears wife in part because their obligatory romance is handled with an utter lack of finesse theres no question that brashears efforts are heroic and worthy of recognition so men of honor serves its basic purpose still one cant help but wonder if brashears story would be even more impressive with a more authentic treatment
5893962 im here to show my support for juana specifically and immigrants overall
5893963 social justice is important as a christian how does our faith respond to this
5893964 jesus sided with the marginalized we have to take care of those who cant speak for themselves
5893965 this is my city these are my neighbors i live here i dont want to treat my neighbors this way
5893966 the anti immigrant fervor is so intense that now common sense is left on the doorstep people have a right to be treated with dignity and respect
5893967 we want to highlight the injustice of 287g we believe the focus is wrong
5893968 and i didnt understand why i was being treated like that
5893969 we have to do more than listen to the loudest voices on each side if we dont talk to each other well never find the answer
5893970 we work toward societies in which each persons value is recognized maintained and strengthened
5893971 we are outraged and heartbroken for the treatment of juana at the hands of the officers who were involved we urge our communities across the state to grieve with us and respond in prayer and political action to work towards repair and reform of the immigration laws of our state and nation the laws of our state and nation must have a face of compassion and or respect of human dignity the majority of immigrants who come to this country come to prosper to make good lives for their families
5893972 go outside and help the volunteers in the parking lot

5893980 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5893981 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5893982 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5893983 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5893984 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5893985 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5893986 weve got to work with the business sector to try and get carbon capture and storage in place because 80 per cent of our electricity in australia at the moment is currently by coal fired power stations he said
5893987 how would you like to receive 800 2 000 4 000 8 000 16 000 32 000 and 48 000 or 83 200 over and over again

5894002 what about this part i think that you have broken my heart what did you mean by that
5894003 i dont know its all just stupid i was just kidding
5894004 i hope that you will never forget me because i will never forget you so you were just kidding here

5894008 i said no but i wondered what the woman really looked like behind that rectangle
5894009 no of course you dont want to look like this but if you arent careful you could youre just a little girl now and really dont understand but what you have written to miss mahnick is called falling in love you dont fall in love with women

5894111 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together
5894112 i have a real issue with this because the commissioner is forcing this on us and it wont save any money
5894113 i cant see spending anymore time on this its not helping education its hurting it
5894114 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
5894115 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
5894116 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
5894117 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has
5894118 if the focus is on the money side it should have been kept on the money side
5894119 wells size allows them to be their own rsu or to be exempt from the consolidation requirement
5894120 im concerned that two weeks after the wells ogunquit combination falls through well get this same letter with another districts name in it
5894121 our nation was founded on judeo christian values and principles
5894122 this just wasnt the elimination of a threat to iraq this was elimination of a threat to the west part of this titanic struggle we are in between western judeo christian values and principles and islamic extremists
5894123 the number one issue people should make in the selection of the president of the united states is will this person carry on in the judeo christian principled tradition that has made this nation the greatest experiment in the history of mankind
5894124 i got it back pretty quickly but from sunup to sundown i worked pretty hard at it
5894125 to shoot 65 to do it makes it that much better i feel really good about the way ive been playing
5894126 i had some moments of greatness mixed in with some pretty awful shots
5894127 that was the hard part im not saying that match play is easy but i just feel more comfortable knowing i can take a deep breath and validate my game
5894128 i always forget the waffle house is like lindsay lohans legs always open
5894129 if i only had one day to live i would spend it inside school where days always seems to last a million years
5894130 in no way will jgr jeopardize any of those cars chances of making the chase by putting logano in a cup car at richmond
5894131 they dont even want to risk the appearance of possibly jeopardizing the chase chances of the other three cars
5894132 hell run some cup races this year whether or not he runs the full thing next year or not
5894133 thats not the problem which ones were going to run with him is still a problem and were still in the process of laying out how that works
5894134 were just trying to figure out when can we gear up and do that ourselves internally
5894135 why did you ask me here then why cant you leave me alone
5894136 the refs dont want to take the passion out of the game
5894137 i think people have a sense of hopelessness if you have a bright future are you really going to shoot people if you think theres not a whole lot to life and dont see it progressing beyond where it is now you do things you know are reckless it doesnt matter to you
5894138 the curfew is an avenue for parents to tell children you have a responsibility not only to yourself but to your parents to be where you should be
5894139 its a typical response from a city that sees a spike in violence
5894140 investigative stop of people to make sure nothing foul is afoot
5894141 nobody was killed or even struck but bullets hit houses of people we know to be innocent and uninvolved
5894142 an elderly woman in her 60s got to the point she was sleeping on her floor out of fear a stray bullet would hit her
5894143 we want to stop the bullets from flying and put fear into the hearts of criminals
5894144 we are going to seriously pursue them and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law
5894145 people were much more willing to talk after we started the curfew and made such a presence of ourselves
5894146 i understand hicks and his friends his little clique decided to start causing havoc in the particular neighborhood where these other guys live
5894147 from what ive been told by the chief its over small stuff not over drugs or even territory
5894148 somebody has insulted somebody on a myspace page or it could be over a girlfriend very very minor things it just shows our young people dont comprehend the finality of their decisions and actions

5894153 without showing any evidence of suspicion of wrongdoing to a court of law our mission is to let people have a free exchange of information and free access to information without feeling that someones looking over their shoulder
5894154 how horrible a terrorist attack is but to me the terrorists win if we give up what makes this country what it is
5894155 we wanted to protect patrons privacy because these letters came with no court order if they were using the letters to pursue terrorists why were they afraid to go to a court to get an order and we wanted people to know that this sort of spying was going on
5894156 we thought civil liberties had been restored but there is no way to win if you do contest the letters
5894157 and librarians face a five year prison terms if they speak about it its quite cynical

5894176 is this sluggard beowulf that he should sit directly below our king
5894177 it is because he is the son of our kings sister and brave ecgtheow and because he has the strength in his arms and legs of thirty men
5894178 it is written in the stars that this beowulf whom you call sluggard will one day be famous in song and story for his deeds of surpassing bravery and strength
5894179 there is among us this night one who has come a long way over the sea and the land he brings he says a wondrous song for you to hear it is long since we have had word from the north and this mans harp is a sweet one sing to us wanderer that we may have your news and your entertainment
5894180 the time has come o beowulf for you to prove your worth
5894181 but i charge you beowulf son of ecgtheow earl of the geats and my own nephew return not to these halls if you should fail in your attempt again i say to you you have great strength go you beowulf and use it nobly
5894182 who are you stranger in daneland that you beach your boat with so much confidence upon these shores

5894184 i can see by your height and breadth and strength that you are a leader of these fine men who stand behind you the name of your king is not unknown to me his fame has long since come to these parts you and your men are well armed but i can see by your faces that you come to this unhappy land with no bad intentions tell me beowulf what is your errand for you must know that this is a dead country that has been dead these twelve years past that our hearts have no joy in them and that hrothgar our king is bowed by sorrow in his age
5894185 and it is to help your good king that i and my earls have come to daneland
5894186 our king will better receive you than it is in my poor power to do leave your ship in my care i will see that no harm comes to it but i dread beholding such a fine company of young men coming on this fell business for the fiend grendel who has robbed hrothgar of his rightful estate and destroyed so many proud young warriors of our kingdom is terrible beyond words to describe

5894190 rumors abound that the russian fsb is preparing cells of jihadists in the crimean peninsula to provide the pretext for military annexation it may well be in the realm of fantasy but moscow has resorted to similar trickery in the past recall the nkvd units that posed as upa soldiers during wwii and killed innocent civilians disguised as ukrainian nationalist freedom fighters
5894191 ukraine should pay off its 1 3bn dollar debt to russia as early as this year and then start charging the russian fleet a real market based rent for the base in accordance with the basic agreements on the fleets stationing in ukraine instead of writing off 97m dollars each year from the ukrainian debt as rent payment russia would then have to pay ukraine up to 1bn dollars a year this would significantly boost the crimean and sevastopol budgets hrytsenko added

5894199 the chinese government is desperate to turn the worlds attention away from its abuses in tibet as the olympics take place but the creativity and determination of tibetans and their supporters has once again ensured that tibetan voices are heard and seen in beijing despite the massive security clampdown
5894200 the chinese leadership must realize that the only way it can make the issue of tibet disappear is to acknowledge the demands of the tibetan people and work with them to bring an end to chinas occupation of tibet

5894205 analysis of the radio tracking data from the pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft at distances between 20 70 au from the sun has consistently indicated the presence of a small but anomalous doppler frequency drift the drift can be interpreted as due to a constant acceleration of 8 74 1 33 10 10 m s2 directed towards the sun although it is suspected that there is a systematic origin to the effect none has been found as a result there is growing interest in the nature of this anomaly
5894206 instruments on the pioneer 11 probe studied the interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields solar wind properties cosmic rays the transition region of the heliosphere neutral hydrogen abundance distribution size mass flux and velocity of dust particles jovian aurorae jovian radio waves the atmospheres of planets and satellites and higher layers of the atmospheres of jupiter and saturn and the surfaces of some of their satellites the instruments carried for these experiments were a magnetometer a plasma analyzer for solar wind a charged particle detector an ion detector non imaging telescopes with overlapping fields of view to detect sunlight reflected from passing meteoroids sealed pressurized cells of argon and nitrogen gas for measuring penetration of meteoroids an ultraviolet photometer an infrared radiometer and an imaging photopolarimeter which produced photographs and measured their polarization further scientific information was obtained from celestial mechanics and occultation phenomena
5894207 now jet propulsion laboratory astronomer john anderson and his colleagues who originally helped uncover the pioneer anomaly have discovered that four spacecraft each raced either a tiny bit faster or slower than expected when they flew past the earth en route to other parts of the solar system

5894220 and those whose faith has made them good in gods sight must live by faith trusting him in everything
5894221 but he must ask in faith without any doubting for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea driven and tossed by the wind for that man ought not to expect that he will receive anything from the lord being a double minded man unstable in all his ways
5894222 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god

5894232 the fact that john mccains top adviser says that a terrorist attack on american soil would be a big advantage for their political campaign is a complete disgrace and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change barack obama will turn the page on these failed policies and this cynical and divisive brand of politics so that we can unite this nation around a common purpose to finish the fight against al qaida

5894320 finally brothers whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things
5894321 you have heard that it was said do not commit adultery but i tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart
5894322 i will sing of the mercies of the lord for ever with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations
5894323 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game
5894324 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected
5894325 to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards out of men
5894326 the world is the devils hunting ground and children are his choicest game
5894327 the marvel of marvels is not that god in his infinite love has not elected
5894328 to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards out of men
5894329 possibile che non abbino mai visto un nano da queste parti
5894330 che io sappia non si visto un nano in tutta la contea a memoria duomo
5894331 sar la sua et ma se devo unaltra volta pagare i danni che combina lo metto a lavorare lo metto
5894332 si ed uno che ho pure dovuto curare in pi di unoccasione anche un paio di cui sua madre non al corrente
5894333 e non lunico da queste parti mi pare di capire
5894334 ehm no in effetti mastro connery mi ha insegnato a curare ed ho usato tali capacit per chi n aveva bisogno
5894335 ti ho portato anche le ordinazioni di mastro connery ma lui passer dopo
5894336 lo so ma alcune di quelle erbe mi servono proprio nelle mie scorte
5894337 che tipo mio padre un buon capo per voi giusto
5894338 fa tutto quello che ritiene necessario per rendere grande la contea questo senza ombra di dubbio
5894339 ti prometto che la cosa rimarr tra noi ma ti prego io devo sapere
5894340 no mia signora suo padre non un uomo giusto un uomo ambizioso per cui la grandezza della contea corrisponde alla propria e basta
5894341 intelligente certamente e c un certo benessere per la gente di cui ma questo finche non si va contro un suo volere anche il pi banale la giustizia qualcosa che piega secondo le sue necessit
5894342 io non credo di essere la persona adatta ad esprimere un giudizio su suo padre
5894343 sono altre le persona a cui dovrebbe rivolgersi per domande del genere
5894344 si gi messo nei guai con il poco che ti ha detto probabilmente
5894345 a chaque tentative de record sur un parcours naturel dans chaque classe il doit y avoir une profondeur minimum de leau d finie comme suit

5894350 with enough people and enough lawsuits like this the city will see a need to change policy
5894351 although defendants believe that they would ultimately have prevailed at a trial the costs of going forward weighed in favor of settlement at this time
5894352 a radical and pervasive change in society and the social structure
5894353 but among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity because these are improper for gods holy people
5894354 how young is too young to be in a romantic relationship
5894355 or dont you know that your body is the temple of the holy spirit who lives in you and was given to you by god you do not belong to yourself for god bought you with a high price so you must honor god with your body
5894356 how can we glorify and honor god in our relationship by maintaining godly standards of purity and integrity
5894357 dont let anyone think less of you because you are young be an example to all believers in what you teach in the way you live in your love your faith and your purity
5894358 what does the bible say about sex before marriage premarital sex
5894359 is it wrong for a couple to live together before marriage
5894360 what does the bible say about sex before marriage premarital sex
5894361 i dont care what identity groups could claim him he died an honorable american warrior
5894362 let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready
5894363 blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb these are the true words of god
5894364 do not do that i am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy

5894371 so that they may rest from their labors for their deeds follow with them
5894372 come up here and i will show you what must take place after these things
5894373 salvation to our god who sits on the throne and to the lamb
5894374 these who are clothed in the white robes who are they and where have they come from
5894375 these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb for this reason they are before the throne of god and they serve him day and night in his temple and he who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them they will hunger no longer nor thirst anymore nor will the sun beat down on them nor any heat for the lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd and will guide them to springs of the water of life and god will wipe every tear from their eyes
5894376 who is like the beast and who is able to wage war with him
5894377 when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour
5894378 these things i have spoken to you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full
5894379 the hope which is laid up for me in heaven
5894380 not that i am sufficient in myself but my sufficiency is of god
5894381 i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him until the day when he returns
5894382 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
5894383 rain on i will not drown for i am standing on higher ground
5894384 you saw me before i was born every day of my life was recorded in your book every moment was laid out before a single day had passed
5894385 maybe there is maybe there isnt and i dont care either way
5894386 radiohead rolled into town this past wednesday night for a show in
5894387 here in my code is a variable that will contain an instance of an object at runtime
5894388 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5894389 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5894390 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5894391 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5894392 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5894393 ps please note that i said hotmail plus users and not msn premium users we are working to offer everyone pop access eventually but for now hotmail plus users are the only ones that can do so
5894394 i wanted to do something really big a way to say thanks to our troops
5894395 i keep hearing and reading that there could be a big deployment of troops in october
5894396 i felt there was an urgency to do this now
5894397 use your own partys mailing lists rather than the registration rolls the party lists are more accurate
5894398 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5894399 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5894400 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5894401 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5894402 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5894403 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5894404 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5894405 obviously these companies want doctors to prescribe the medicines theyre marketing
5894406 we want doctors to make their decisions based solely on their best medical judgment rather than the best interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers
5894407 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5894408 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5894409 in 2006 abu saif was on our list of high value targets to capture or kill
5894410 now i was shaking his hand breaking bread with him and working to expel a common enemy
5894411 but it actually liberates local citizens by giving them an opportunity to prevent al qaida from using their homes and neighborhoods some families have actually run after soldiers asking to participate if their house has been missed by mistake
5894412 every other day we had a doctors appointment he had these seizures and sometimes hed cry for hours
5894413 we had no money i had talked to the landlord and said you know im not gonna be able to pay the rent
5894414 needless to say eventually we ended up getting an eviction notice
5894415 i was homeless for two years nobody will rent to me because of the eviction
5894416 anything that has ostensibly objectionable content becomes a huge challenge for a marketer
5894417 if you want to monetize that audience you have to create a big enough audience
5894418 weve found that a lot of our pieces have gotten a second life on youtube
5894419 hey world today i threw up like fifteen times and now im craving charcoal with tomato ketchup
5894420 the best way to destroy your enemy is to make him your friend
5894421 man is a religious animal man is the only religious animal he is the only animal that has the true religion several of them he is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isnt straight he has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brothers path to happiness and heaven the higher animals have no religion and we are told that they are going to be left out in the hereafter i wonder why it seems questionable taste
5894422 there was no place in the land where the seeker could not find some small budding sign of pity for the slave no place in all the land but one the pulpit it yielded last it always does it fought a strong and stubborn fight and then did what it always does joined the procession at the tail end slavery fell the slavery texts in the bible remained the practice changed that was all
5894423 i dont want to sound callous i mean even if i have nothing to offer that doesnt matter because that still doesnt mean that what anybody else has to offer therefore has to be true
5894424 like computer viruses successful mind viruses will tend to be hard for their victims to detect if you are the victim of one the chances are that you wont know it and may even vigorously deny it
5894425 this time we will perform in los angeles in venues dedicated to underground metal it is the correct setting and the correct circumstances for us and we are greatly anticipating these shows
5894426 era de esperarse la decisi n de la fiscal a dijo palacio lo m s importante es tener el espacio para contrainterrogar a yidis medina y a otras personas era un espacio que estaba buscando hace rato
5894427 how can we get into the studio to do this
5894428 i think it would be a bad idea wow could you imagine a high school party when most of the seniors can legally buy and consume alcohol that would be very scary
5894429 i think that the colleges want it because it takes the responsibility of enforcing the laws away from them i even asked my 18 year old son what he thought and he looked at me as if i was crazy he said that it would be a really bad idea because there are enough drunken 18 year olds with the law in place without there being more
5894430 i dont think that they have enough facts to support this decision on changing the age but on the other hand i see it as at age 18 youre old enough to die for your country to you should be old enough to have a beer
5894431 when youre told you cant drink well then it seems that much more appealing and youll do whatever it takes to be able to whether the age is 21 or 18 there will still be kids getting alcohol theyll still drink and drive and there will still be binge drinking
5894432 underage drinking isn t the problem it is a symptom you have kids going from over protected childhoods straight to under protected under supported adult living situations in the matter of a car ride you want to see a reduction in reckless behavior then someone needs to figure out how to make that transition into adulthood more productive
5894433 i think the drinking age should stand firm at 21 i agree with anna just because people are legally considered adults doesnt mean that they are responsible enough to handle adult situations like drinking
5894434 far better to have 18 year olds drinking in public where they can learn to drink responsibly than to have them drinking in private where they learn to binge
5894435 this is an individual state issue but yes if our young people can sign contracts marry be drafted to fight in war and vote they also should have the right to drink alcohol
5894436 this is one subject i think europeans are right about drinking shouldnt be something we make into this huge taboo
5894437 lets lower the drinking age and give them cell phones to use while driving the 1 group of people that have accidents are teenagers why in the world cant a law just be applied and enforced without making a set of new laws
5894438 i believe if a soldier is willing to fight for his country he should be able to have a beer when hes done
5894439 the drinking age is 19 here 18 in quebec and i think we have all the same issues as everywhere else i also think by having it at 21 more kids are sneaking off binging etc plus 21 is old you can drive vote get married go to war and do all the adult things why not have a drink
5894440 what about teaching kids the philosophy the pleasures and the dangers of alcohol drinking when they are in their teens and before they go away from home what about teaching them moderation before they binge
5894441 y en el transcurso de los d as cuando esto se conozca ese n mero aumentar
5894442 porque se cre a que las v ctimas hab an entendido que ten an plazo solo hasta el 15 de agosto
5894443 ya hay 250 mil familias esperando ese subsidio para el cual el ministerio de ambiente y vivienda dispuso de 100 mil millones de pesos

5894445 i got it back pretty quickly but from sunup to sundown i worked pretty hard at it
5894446 to shoot 65 to do it makes it that much better i feel really good about the way ive been playing
5894447 i had some moments of greatness mixed in with some pretty awful shots
5894448 that was the hard part im not saying that match play is easy but i just feel more comfortable knowing i can take a deep breath and validate my game
5894449 on defense we set the tone and the tempo we are really getting some good chemistry we have a tough game ahead but this was an a plus performance all around
5894450 we can just keep putting people on the floor and have no let up at all
5894451 from eureka to ekalaka from sanders county to sydney from shelby down to red lodge montana communities are struggling to house their people
5894452 keeping the systems up to snuff is an expensive proposition
5894453 if you have a community these days thats spread out all over the place youre looking at huge energy costs
5894454 when we lose those mobile home courts were losing affordable housing that cant easily be replaced
5894455 unnecessary costs and be contrary to the growth policy goals and objectives to accommodate community growth
5894456 losing density upsizing homes providing additional open space common area and common area maintenance etc add to the cost of the project the increased costs are forward shifted to the homebuyer
5894457 por lo acotado del plantel si se avanza en la copa habr que optar entre ese certamen y el local
5894458 por lo acotado del plantel si se avanza en la copa sudamericana habr que optar entre ese torneo y el apertura
5894459 tendremos que elegir uno de los dos torneos esta es la realidad
5894460 los dirigentes ya saben lo que pienso todav a no tengo nuevas noticias se est trabajando es dif cil pero conf o mucho en este grupo por eso estoy tranquilo

5894467 i want to go to a nice atmosphere and where i feel at home
5894468 id like a program with a good winning tradition too
5894469 i love the atmosphere at south carolina especially during game day
5894470 they just said that i need to improve my grades
5894471 they told me id have to get something like a 960 and get my gpa up
5894472 i had a 1 8 last year and have been improving i know what i need to get and i think ill make it
5894473 i love their tradition and its a very prestigious program
5894474 i actually dont really know too much about them yet
5894475 id like to visit them and see what they are like
5894476 they send a lot of mail they just sent me a letter asking me to call them i plan to do that this week they just started recruiting me a few weeks ago
5894477 i like to jam the wide receiver and get really physical im aggressive and play smart im always watching the quarterbacks eyes
5894478 obwohl wir gro e fortschritte machen entspricht der dienst noch nicht unseren standards
5894479 wut im bauch wer ist schuld an der globalen hungerkrise
5894480 we are excited about the opportunity to play 18 games in front of the home crowd and look forward to the start of the season
5894481 all of the year end awards whether its the american academy the baftas as in britain the awards in france the golden globes all of those awards begin with the films that are going to be lining up for those best picture categories and the best acting categories at toronto
5894482 the wrestler with mickey rourke which i think is going to be on everybodys list by the end of this year
5894483 the duchess of devonshire with keira knightley which is a beautiful film and she gives a really mature performance
5894484 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5894485 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5894486 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5894487 creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned

5894491 fuck if i know i might just get tired of this shit and walk into the barbershop one day
5894492 people need stories more than bread itself they tell us how to live and why
5894493 the power is in the balance we are our injuries as much as we are our successes
5894494 yeah we need you to come in tomorrow itll count as overtime

5894499 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5894500 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
5894501 its very important to reveal the mystery of the pyramid science in archaeology is very important people all over the world are waiting to solve this mystery
5894502 i believe that these doors are hiding something it could be and this is a theory that maybe khufus cheops chamber is still hidden in the pyramid
5894503 we will almost certainly learn why those two lower shafts were specially constructed to be totally invisible and we will finally gain the long sought key we require to unlock the overall mystery of the cheops pyramid
5894504 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
5894505 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
5894506 the page cannot be found coz has been owned by someone get out
5894507 theres a lot of personality infused in just the design alone
5894508 you always do a great job i love reading all your stuff
5894509 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5894510 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5894511 the facts are well known that franchised public transport has delivered good value for money and will continue to do so
5894512 we had good tempo on both sides of the ball today
5894513 we were businesslike in our approach and really looked like a football team out there
5894514 no i cant do that you wouldnt kill me would you
5894515 dont cry i cant cry i cant feel im just lifeless please just kill me
5894516 where is he where is the mop at where is he

5894525 i just want to get you out of the fridge and set you in a safer environment can you let me do that
5894526 once upon a time there was a man named jack he was in a box just fine people would turn the box and wind it up and jack would pop out all smiles scaring them wowing them pushing and pulling them then one day jack heard a sound outside this beautiful song he came out now and again but really he never could hear it much with all the ruckess of popping in and out never staying long then one day jack was sitting alone in the dark and decided to get out of the box he sat down in a lotus and turned the handle he heard the most beautiful sound the box started glowing and it never opened up again this thing called snow started falling he felt calm and cool and he saw all this space and he smiled there was nothing but beautiful glittering white light the box never stopped turning he wasnt trapped anymore he was free suddenly he saw a girl come out of the snow she wasnt like the other people that came and went she just sang and floated around drifting by settling by her name was leela she didnt really want to change him or push him or keep him or get anything out of him she just liked that he was there and he didnt feel like he needed to push or pull her he just liked that she was there when she was there and jack and leela lived in a hypnagogic mirage of what could only be called nyma the moon and the sun the bird and the serpent just passing by and being kind to each other just being good neighbors to one another
5894527 now sleep and say goodbye to spectra give her a kiss goodbye
5894528 goodnight sweet prince may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
5894529 the baby gets what the baby wants until shes two
5894530 heres a democratic promise john key could make that if prime minister he will promote a fixed term for parliament republican helen clark has clung to the vestige of monarchical power that allows her in effect to set the election date
5894531 any less proportional alternative to mmp certainly the supplementary member system he favours would advantage the two big old parties in this election it would have smoothed nationals bid for power
5894532 first the electorate has been steadily whittling down the wasted vote for parties which get party votes but not seats from 7 5 per cent in 1996 to 6 per cent in 1999 4 9 per cent in 2002 and 1 3 per cent in 2005
5894533 this is a tragedy anytime somebody dies anytime somebodys killed thats a tragedy but one has a right to act in self defense
5894534 he was traumatized and upset about what had happened and had been up all night long and he had several drinks
5894535 leeds community school got just short of a quarter of a million pounds from leeds city council and other sources
5894536 we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago
5894537 they just beat us up because of the color of our skin
5894538 thats when they came running towards us and said you f n
5894539 its like they had no regard for us as human beings
5894540 he said i need you to come to the hospital
5894541 there was a real good witness an independent witness who watched the whole thing
5894542 i think some hate might have come out during the attack but i dont know what sparked the whole thing
5894543 i know my son and hes not anything like that
5894544 hab a un gran n cleo convictivo con nubes verticales de gran desarrollo que se producen generalmente encima de monta as de gran altitud y a muy bajas presiones las llamamos nubes de tormenta
5894545 no fue igual que la acontecida a principios del mes de hecho cesaron las precipitaciones ya antes del mediod a del martes
5894546 students cant learn and teachers cant teach in classrooms where kids are disruptive some teachers are afraid to restore order when needed because they fear legal harassment its unacceptable that a teacher would have that hesitation
5894547 ultimately we need parents to recognize that firm school discipline is in every childs interest and support teachers in doing whatever is necessary to maintain it but for now we need action to see that no students education is damaged by the bad behavior of anyone around him
5894548 no such absolute right to home school exists parents possess a constitutional liberty interest in directing the education of their children but the right must yield to state interests in certain circumstances
5894549 nosotros no hemos tenido ninguna comunicaci n oficial desde la embajada nicarag ense con respecto a este tema y por tanto no conocemos el origen la fuente de la informaci n
5894550 ella busc protecci n en la embajada de nicaragua en ecuador y por razones estrictamente humanitarias pues nosotros le hemos dado esa acogida
5894551 no sabemos si eso se debe a que se omiti esta comunicaci n o simple y llanamente en que hay alguna imprecisi n en la informaci n internacional y la se ora arrib a nicaragua por otras v as

5894603 to form an equitable judgment about the subjects moral responsibility and to guide pastoral action one must take into account the affective immaturity force of acquired habit conditions of anxiety or other psychological or social factors that lessen if not even reduce to a minimum moral culpability
5894604 the true religion is the universal religion which is why catholicism has adopted the only name which indicates the truth furthermore this religion maintains orthodoxy in doctrine the hierarchy of the powers the efficacy of worship and the genuine magic of ceremonies in other words it is typical and normal religion the mother religion to which the mosaic traditions and the ancient oracles of hermes rightly belong
5894605 we have stated elsewhere that the ancient rites have lost their efficacy since the advent of christianity catholic christianity is in fact the legitimate daughter of jesus whom the magi adored catholic worship is nothing other than high magic referred to the laws of the hierarchy which are indispensable to ensure that it is both reasonable and efficacious an ordinary scapular worn by a true christian is a more invincible talisman than the ring and the pentacle of solomon jesus christ son of god and son of man so humble said of himself the queen of sheba came from the distant east to see and listen to solomon and a greater than solomon is here the mass is the most prodigious of evocations necromancers evoke the dead sorcerers evoke the devil and tremble but the catholic priest does not tremble to evoke the living god what are all the talismans of ancient science in comparison with the consecrated wafer let solomons skeleton sleep on in its tomb of rock together with the ring he may have on his bony finger jesus christ has risen from the dead he lives take one of those silver rings as sold at the church porch stamped with the image of the crucified and with ten rosary beads if you are worthy to wear it it will be more effective in your hands than the genuine ring of solomon would be
5894606 we have stated elsewhere that the ancient rites have lost their efficacy since the advent of christianity
5894607 the great arcanum the inexpressible arcanum the dangerous arcanum the incomprehensible arcanum may be definitively formulated thus
5894608 what a blasphemy it would be to israel to say that god is a man and what folly it would be to you christians what an abominable paradox it would be to say that man can make himself god crucify the profaner of the arcanum burn the initiators christianos ad leonem christians to the lions the christians made use of the lions and the entire world conquered by the martyr to the darkness of the great arcanum found itself groping like oedipus before the solution of the final problem that of the man god the man god is a truth the cry went up but he must be as unique on earth as he is in heaven the man god infallible almighty is the pope and at the bottom of this proclamation which has been written and repeated under all forms one can read such names as alexander borgia the man god is liberated man the reformation said next and that cry which people hoped they could stuff down the protestants throats ended up as the roar of the revolution the terrible word of the enigma was pronounced but it became more enigmatic than before what is truth asked pilate in condemning jesus christ what is liberty ask our modern pilates as they wash their hands in the blood of the nations ask the revolutionaries from mirabeau to garibaldi what liberty is and they will never reach agreement for robespierre and marat it is a chopper adjusted at a certain level for garibaldi it is a red shirt and a sabre for ideologists it is a declaration of the rights of man but what man are we talking about is the convict suppressed because society chains him up has a man rights because he is a man or only when he behaves himself for the profane masses liberty is the absolute assertion of their rights rights which always seem to involve restrictions and servitude if liberty is simply the right to do good it is being confused with duty and can hardly be distinguished from virtue everything which the world has seen and tried up to now has failed to solve the problem posed by magic and by the gospel the great arcanum of the man god the man god has neither rights nor duties he has knowledge will and power he is more than free he is a master he does not issue orders he causes to be done he does not obey for none can command him that which others call duty he terms his good pleasure he does good because he wishes to do it and could do no other he freely co operates with everything that is just and for him sacrifice is the luxury of a moral life and magnificence of soul he is implacable towards evil because he is without hatred for the wicked he looks on corrective punishment as a benefit and does not understand the meaning of vengeance such is the man who has succeeded in reaching the central point of balance and one can without blasphemy or folly call him the man god because his soul is identified with the eternal principle of truth and justice the liberty of the perfect man is the divine law itself it soars above all human laws and all the conventional obligations of the religious systems the law is made for man said christ and not man for the law the son of man is lord of the sabbath that is to say the requirement to keep the sabbath imposed by moses under pain of death only binds man in so far as it is useful to him for in the final analysis man is the sovereign master all is permissible for me said saint paul but not everything is expedient by which he meant that we have the right to do anything which harms neither ourselves nor others and that our freedom is only restricted by the warnings of our conscience and our reason the wise man never has any scruples he behaves with common sense and only does what he wants to do so in his own sphere he can do everything and is blameless qui natus est ex deo non peccat he who is born of god does not sin says saint paul because his errors being involuntary cannot be imputed to him it is towards this sovereign independence that the human soul must advance through the difficulties of progress this is veritably the great arcanum of occultism because it is thus that the mysterious promise of the serpent is realized you will be as gods knowing good and evil this is how the serpent of eden is transfigured and becomes the serpent of brass to heal all the wounds of humanity jesus christ himself has been compared to this serpent by the church fathers because said they he has taken the form of sin to change the abundance of iniquity into the superabundance of justice we have spoken plainly here and have revealed the truth without veils and yet we are not afraid that anyone can rightly accuse us of being someone who makes rash disclosures those who ought not to understand these pages will not understand them for to a sight which is too weak truth when shown in all its nakedness appears veiled in its own light and concealed beneath its own brilliant splendour
5894609 a useful including myth america is not a truly free and open society

5894616 woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the lord
5894617 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
5894618 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not
5894619 well it was hard and you tried so here is a medal for effort
5894620 you did just as well as she did but well give her second place

5894633 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5894634 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5894635 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5894636 working closely to resolve the issue which may be the cause of a slightly frosty relationship between the two

5894640 getting us at the pump was the right thing to do after that heart attack that was doubled illegally by the nurse
5894641 after his testes were attacked illegally by the nurse we attacked the testes of usa why is that unfair
5894642 his dumbass routines are so good that he should marry the one woman from kaila yu
5894643 bill gates deserves nspa treatment from trevor because he never confronted him about the emails he never wrote
5894644 im all in on this every email idea if he wrote all or none of the email thats fine if he wrote some and not others then there are 85 acts in federal land with civil commitment in stanford land
5894645 think about it he should be married to kaila hes a dumbass hes rich dependently hes an author
5894646 hes a genius for going after mckennas reputation because rob was supposed to be the us attorney general a long time ago and we self slipped him because of how young he was
5894647 hes a lince patient and his best online friend is a washington dc self published fantasy author that speaks spanish do you know how much power is in those 3 or 4 people

5894651 if youre telling me they want to work ill give them a go
5894652 why not ill employ anyone so long as they are willing to work
5894653 the kind of money which employers are putting up to bring them in and repatriate them would be much better invested in getting local aboriginal people a start in the local economy
5894654 the fact that weve got a substantial pool of unemployed people who are our immediate ongoing responsibility makes this an exercise in folly because obviously if any of these pacific islanders are working nearby high unemployment aboriginal towns the local people are going to feel cheated
5894655 my frustration in all this stuff is the inept failure of government to actually engage
5894656 to hear that the government are proposing to bring in more overseas workers when aboriginal people are disadvantaged in the workforce is shameful
5894657 i cant understand them importing people from other places when youve got really high unemployment in your town be it aboriginal white or what
5894658 every season we get aboriginal people here picking fruit for us
5894659 any person who comes in looking for work gets put on
5894660 in a place like robinvale thriving industry not enough workers they should be supplied from within australia
5894661 if weve got a work shortage in places like cape york and theyve got a worker shortage down here we should provide the workers
5894662 if youre going to fly people from the pacific islands whats wrong with flying people from cape york for instance or karratha or melbourne or sydney or brisbane or nhulunbuy
5894663 sick to death of watching their fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick
5894664 a very large number of people around 100 converged on the hospital i believe they may have been friends and family of the deceased man she said
5894665 i am very pleased with this game i think we played especially in the first half very well when we had the ball
5894666 you see in the second half the rhythm was a little bit broken we were not as good as in the first half but thats normal if you change two or three players and then two more
5894667 overall i can only be very pleased with the performance the mentality and attitude of the players and i can only look forward to the training camp in september in the netherlands

5894724 people in basra and nasariyah in the south or mosul in the north always ask us to provide them with products its a good sign for us that people still want high quality
5894725 we faced a hard situation when the insurgents and militias took over the neighborhoods here
5894726 we faced a lot of problems especially with the power
5894727 we discovered this was something they were lacking and not only would it bring revenue and jobs but it would also help the whole country as well
5894728 we were able to save them quite a bit so were hoping with that money they will be able to get the parts they need
5894729 theyve been running at a loss pretty much since 2003 because of low productivity but theyve been able to come through i think a lot of that money is coming from their other businesses they run or personal money

5894738 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5894739 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5894740 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5894741 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5894742 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
5894743 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
5894744 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community

5894762 equiparnos adecuadamente porque sabemos que esta es una guerra y dentro de esta guerra requerimos ser inteligentes requerimos contar con equipamiento adecuado requerimos dotar a los cuerpos de seguridad del armamento de los veh culos pero insisto mucho de los sistemas de informaci n estrat gicos para ser certeros tanto para la prevenci n como para la reacci n

5894764 hay que reconocer que la fuerza policial est en los municipios y por tanto hay municipios un poco marginados un poco descuidados y requerimos fortalecer estas corporaciones municipales para poder dar buenas respuestas
5894765 requerimos un cambio dr stico en las corporaciones pero en conjunto mantener la informaci n en cada uno de los estados de manera exacta y oportuna porque hay estados que no cuentan con su padr n vehicular actualizado y esto es fundamental hay estados en donde cuentan con muchos veh culos chocolates sin registro y veh culos sin placas que la autoridad municipal no hace lo propio tenemos que hacer todos compromisos reales y aut nticos jalar este alambre parejo y dar buenos resultados

5894786 this issue is across the country its ubiquitous we all have the same problems where because of the current drinking age many of our students as we understand it now go behind closed doors
5894787 across the country the number of alcohol related incidents that end up in emergency rooms across the country have increased because of this phenomenon of behind closed doors binge drinking
5894788 we really feel that students are pretty good peer educators and we know peer culture is part of the problem so we want to make it part of the solution
5894789 i think many schools to include the suny schools are considering what position to take or how to review the initiative
5894790 we think that college presidents are shirking their responsibilities if theyve signed on to this theyre waving the white flag on underage drinking versus enforcing working on alcohol policy and trying to change an environment that needs a little help

5894797 we havent finalized it it wont be as high as 50 but itll be in the mid to high 30s is my best guess
5894798 the technology was a marvel at the time but consumers were very uneasy about the fact that they could only get 50 to 100 miles of range it taught us we had to come up with some options that gave us the advantage of battery power but also provided a backup

5894935 employees are struggling to keep on top of to do lists and think the answer is to work harder eating a sandwich at their desk as opposed to taking a full lunch break and also not having sufficient breaks during the rest of the day
5894936 but these breaks are essential for staff to perform at their best and cope with the daily pressures of work managers should be encouraging staff to take lunch breaks their performance and ultimately the business may suffer otherwise
5894937 the vast majority of people are having lunch at their desk while working thats the average person now very rarely do they get out of the office
5894938 if senior management create a culture that lunch is for wimps its counterproductive we all need breaks
5894939 people feel they have to get to work early stay late and not take lunch breaks and i think its going to get worse because of job insecurity people will want to show more commitment and that means working through their lunch and staying late
5894940 although there are times when people have to work through they should try to get out two or three times a week for a good hour particularly in summer be brave because in the end you will be judged by your output not by your presenteeism
5894941 i definitely feel refreshed and mentally sharper when i come back if i dont get out at lunchtime the day just feels like one constant grind all the way through and i really like the way it breaks up the day

5894972 well no but you have to ask yourself what it means
5894973 president elect mccain will be making a very big mistake by appointing joe leiberman as his vp
5894974 you ever notice how anyone who stands between them and power is an evil idiot bent on the destruction of the world funny how that works
5894975 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
5894976 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5894977 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5894978 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5894979 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5894980 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5894981 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5894982 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5894983 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5894984 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5894985 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5894986 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5894987 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5894988 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones
5894989 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
5894990 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour

5895004 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide
5895005 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5895006 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5895007 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5895008 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5895009 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5895010 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5895011 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5895012 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5895013 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
5895014 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
5895015 not only are we waging two illegal and immoral wars in afghanistan and iraq but theyre planning on attacking another country iran and we will not let them do that
5895016 hey buddy why dont you use the other side of the street for now
5895017 ne dam usor seama de preocuprea constanta a dirijorului pentru muzica contemporana
5895018 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5895019 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5895020 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5895021 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5895022 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania
5895023 i have one more point to make maybe two wait where are you going
5895024 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11
5895025 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5895026 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5895027 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5895028 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5895029 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5895030 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5895031 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5895032 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5895033 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5895034 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5895035 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5895036 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5895037 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5895038 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5895039 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5895040 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5895041 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5895042 they told me there are going to be resources here
5895043 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5895044 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5895045 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5895046 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5895047 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5895048 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5895049 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5895050 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5895051 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5895052 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5895053 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5895054 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5895055 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5895056 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5895057 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5895058 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5895059 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5895060 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5895061 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5895062 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5895063 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5895064 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5895065 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5895066 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5895067 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5895068 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5895069 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5895070 as for governor kaine of virginia his big problem is well barack has had to overcome and it will continue to be his biggest obstacle is that too many of the voters simply dont know him well enough to vote for him
5895071 the story of stuff is a 20 minute fast paced fact filled look at the underside of our production and consumption patterns the story of stuff exposes the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world itll teach you something itll make you laugh and it just may change the way you look at all the stuff in your life forever

5895086 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5895087 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5895088 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5895089 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5895090 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5895091 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5895092 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5895093 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5895094 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5895095 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid

5895099 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5895100 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5895101 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5895102 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5895103 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5895104 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
5895105 we never figured on a rising sea level when building the height of the dikes
5895106 there will be a time that the tide will be so high it will overtop the dikes and nova scotia will become an island for a couple of hours
5895107 it would completely flood the only rail link to nova scotia and the main highway to nova scotia
5895108 wed have some really serious communications problems plus land loss and a tremendous loss of property
5895109 the railway is on top of the dike and it will be a major effort to lift that dike to a higher level because youd first have to build another rail line

5895130 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5895131 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5895132 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5895133 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5895134 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5895135 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5895136 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one

5895140 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together

5895143 we are always thinking about different ways to stop littering and this idea is great and fun

5895145 the idea is to make a thing that is considered lifeless alive
5895146 we hope it will encourage people to put rubbish in the bin to see if that can is the one that talks
5895147 property continues to grow from something of a niche topic to one which has become an integral part of the new zealand news media and given the events in the property market and in the wider economy in the last 12 months we look forward to some particularly interesting entries
5895148 property is such a vital part of new zealands infrastructure and key sectors such as tourism and retailing which are reliant on a vibrant property market to ensure their vital infrastructure continues to develop
5895149 property journalism plays an important role in both good times and bad and the changing economic environment for both residential and commercial property development and investment in the last year has seen journalists having to extend themselves to cover the growing complexity of the market
5895150 our members play a huge role in the economy and it is essential that their activities and objectives are well understood and conveyed often through the media to the wider public
5895151 do we want a new direction rooted in historical american values or one that might be described as aberrational that is unusual in which we attack countries that havent attacked us in which we lay plans for long term occupation of a land where america and the west are deeply resented
5895152 its time for a change and that change needs to come quickly

5895177 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5895178 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5895179 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5895180 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5895181 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

5895240 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5895241 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5895242 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5895243 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5895244 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5895245 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5895246 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5895247 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5895248 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5895249 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5895250 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5895251 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5895252 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5895253 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5895254 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5895255 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5895256 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5895257 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5895258 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5895259 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5895260 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5895261 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5895262 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5895263 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5895264 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5895265 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5895266 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5895267 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5895268 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5895269 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5895270 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5895271 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5895272 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5895273 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5895274 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5895275 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5895276 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5895277 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5895278 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5895279 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5895280 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5895281 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5895282 many asian brands were grown from copy cat economics using western benchmarks and paradigms most asian brands were driven by a 3 fold strategy copy that make them cheaply and make alot of it eventhough this may be fundamentally sustainable in the coming 20 to 30 years asian brands must transition from being centres of imitation to centres of creation to succeed otherwise there will be little economic sustainability in the long run
5895283 that means having the courage to step outside ones comfort zone and go against the grain
5895284 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5895285 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5895286 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5895287 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5895288 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5895289 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5895290 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5895291 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5895292 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5895293 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5895294 i talked to my doctor and he said i tore some ligaments or something
5895295 its something where he still has to wear a cast because of a bruise
5895296 we think by the time we get to the season opener that it will be a non issue
5895297 the problem is hes got to wear that cast throughout all these practices and probably will still have to have it on this week
5895298 its hard to tackle its hard to be a corner with a cast on but its the situation that it is and well make the best of it
5895299 theres nothing telling us that theres going to be surgery
5895300 everything tells us that hes going to be ok for the opener we think that it will be over by then
5895301 you needed to meet him were grooming him to be secretary of the treasury one day if he doesnt mess up
5895302 oh my i dont want to go to prison like ken lay did i had best get out of all my short positions and just sit on the sidelines or do what cramer says
5895303 the only one of its kind at the bargain price of 425 000 i loved those ads and the realtors that used to promote them in their slutwear then hell yes let me go into default so my neighbors can bail me out
5895304 among the many developments in the story last week was the solidifying consensus that the nation is in really serious trouble and the noticeable slippage of legitimacy among those pretending to run financial affairs
5895305 lluitar aix s el primer pas per construir alguna cosa
5895306 em deleixo per pujar al cotxe i fer la primera volta
5895307 s que c rrer en aquest tra at ser una cosa especial
5895308 el que ha fet val ncia marcar un abans i un despr s a la f 1 ja que s una obra impressionant s m s estic molt orgull s dhaver treballat des del primer dia en aquesta idea
5895309 val ncia no nom s tindr un dels millors circuits urbans del m n sin un dels millors tra ats del m n segur tant la generalitat com lajuntament de val ncia han estat molt valents molt a lafrontar aquesta obra
5895310 em penso que el nom encertat per a aquesta carrera no s el de gran premi deuropa sin que shauria de dir gran premi del m n
5895311 ser una cosa realment molt innovadora molt i tots estem ansiosos per fer les primeres voltes
5895312 no tinc ni idea de com s el circuit tot i que s cert que he vist repetides vegades un v deo que un amic meu que fa poc temps va prendre part en una carrera de turismes en la inauguraci del circuit valenci em va gravar amb una c mera que va col locar al morro del cotxe mha semblat realment molt salvatge sassembla molt a aquelles pistes urbanes on es corre als estats units
5895313 a la recta poden arribar a m s de 300 quil metres per hora val ncia pot ser un circuit verdaderament molt complicat i sequivocar el pilot que pretengui superar els l mits
5895314 s bonic r pid i els revolts s n molt velo os de forma i manera que es podr avan ar m s que no pas a montecarlo

5895317 per ser una pista urbana la veig rapid ssima mai hem passat per sobre de laigua amb un f 1 i en aquest sentit ser impressionant
5895318 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5895319 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5895320 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5895321 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5895322 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5895323 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5895324 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5895325 why are we hearing about this it isnt our weather
5895326 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5895327 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5895328 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5895329 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5895330 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5895331 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5895332 i am glad that we are taking matters in our hands climate change is not science fiction it is real and needs our attention
5895333 boys to feel that they have a very loving family
5895334 we have a compost bin and my boys know how to use it and they do compost all the food regularly from where it goes into the garden
5895335 de acuerdo con las estimaciones que se hicieron seg n las cotizaciones de sus acciones en la bolsa de valores de caracas el total no llegar a a 400 millones de d lares
5895336 i too am obsessed with the george washington bridge and have been ever since as stoned youths me and my friends cavorted in the park on the new jersey side that is directly below the place where the roadway meets the land
5895337 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
5895338 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
5895339 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
5895340 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
5895341 she was a stray but she worked her way up
5895342 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
5895343 one of the leading consumer electronics companies in the world
5895344 commitment to contributing to society by offering the kind of original useful products that only casio can
5895345 delivers sharper photos and higher quality videos using less energy than ever before and at faster speeds thanks to an improved signal processor
5895346 lets open the diaphragm and boost the iso to keep the shutter speed high
5895347 shooting with anti shake can cause an image to appear somewhat coarser than normal and can cause slight deterioration of image resolution
5895348 not sure if this was a gift of creativity or completely unoriginal but otherwise still hilarious
5895349 an officemate of mine had the nerve to actually take a day off his reward a completley cardboarded office space complete with tape dispenser handset new cardboard stapler in original packaging
5895350 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
5895351 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside sen barack obamas inner inner circle knows
5895352 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
5895353 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5895354 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5895355 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5895356 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5895357 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5895358 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5895359 get it off the air and i really mean it
5895360 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5895361 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5895362 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5895363 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5895364 i am married to the next president of the united states
5895365 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5895366 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5895367 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5895368 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5895369 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5895370 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5895371 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5895372 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5895373 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5895374 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5895375 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5895376 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5895377 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5895378 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5895379 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5895380 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5895381 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5895382 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5895383 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5895384 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5895385 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5895386 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5895387 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5895388 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5895389 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5895390 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5895391 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5895392 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5895393 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5895394 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5895395 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5895396 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5895397 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5895398 intento pintar un retrat just i aut ntic daquest home

5895403 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5895404 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5895405 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5895406 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5895407 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5895408 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5895409 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5895410 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5895411 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5895412 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5895413 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5895414 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5895415 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5895416 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5895417 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5895418 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5895419 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5895420 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5895421 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5895422 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5895423 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5895424 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5895425 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5895426 oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in state or federal revenue
5895427 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5895428 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5895429 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5895430 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5895431 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5895432 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
5895433 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
5895434 how to add new media to your existing media and communications department

5895437 pot ser la millor interpretaci de lany o la pitjor
5895438 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5895439 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
5895440 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
5895441 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
5895442 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
5895443 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it
5895444 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5895445 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5895446 running a hedge fund is harder than it looks on tv
5895447 petite leggy women with big busts are the most sexually attractive study reveals

5895449 a man being suspended in the air by six metal hooks clamped to his skin during an act at a tattoo convention fell and broke a leg
5895450 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5895451 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5895452 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5895453 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5895454 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5895455 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5895456 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5895457 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5895458 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5895459 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5895460 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5895461 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5895462 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
5895463 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5895464 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5895465 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5895466 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5895467 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5895468 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5895469 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5895470 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5895471 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5895472 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5895473 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5895474 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5895475 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5895476 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5895477 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5895478 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5895479 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5895480 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5895481 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5895482 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5895483 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5895484 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5895485 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5895486 lluitar aix s el primer pas per construir alguna cosa

5895492 mudgee is currently the fastest growing coal producing region in nsw
5895493 if planned expansion of the three mines ulan wilpinjong and moolarben goes ahead there will be between forty and fifty million tonnes of coal produced per year from this area
5895494 there is two and a half tonnes of co2 produced from every tonne of coal which means the mudgee region could be responsible for the release of 150 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere
5895495 it creates severe subsidence and interferes with the ground water system
5895496 subsidence can also initiate tremors which can be the equivalent of small earthquakes
5895497 we want to extend the goulburn river national park to include the drip gorge and land currently held in lease by the moolarben mine
5895498 when you see the enormous devastation caused to a pristine environment by coal mining companies its outrageous enough
5895499 but when you convert the practice into greenhouse gas emissions its terrifying and australia is one of the biggest emitters in the world
5895500 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5895501 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5895502 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5895503 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5895504 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
5895505 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5895506 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5895507 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
5895508 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5895509 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5895510 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5895511 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5895512 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5895513 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5895514 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5895515 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5895516 we welcomed back a veteran team to the gym a week ago and weve been in the gym practicing hard
5895517 i stood here last year and said we were going to be a special team and im going to say it again we certainly had a special season last year and we will have another one this year i have no doubt
5895518 she worked very hard played for the usa a 2 national team this summer and had a great experience and kyna washington has been the gun for us shes been the go to player and she will be that again she has really matured with our offense and has become a great all around player i look for her to have some great stats this year and certainly lead the way for our team and our success
5895519 well go back to nebraska to play the university of nebraska the premier spot in the country to play volleyball they are going to sell out their arena theyre expecting 13 000 people at our match friday night in that tournament against nebraska in a home football weekend and were the premier match
5895520 we welcomed back a veteran team to the gym a week ago and weve been in the gym practicing and currently still in the gym at this moment we have a talented group i stood here last year and said we were going to be a special team and im going to say it again we certainly had a special season last year and we will have another one this year i have no doubt
5895521 we have a transfer from the university of louisville sam dabbs samantha dabbs was an all american in high school and played for the university of louisville for the last 2 years she comes in as a junior and is a highly touted setter she was a fab 50 setter out of high school and certainly adds a great deal of depth and leadership at our setting position lauren waclawczyk is a libero defense specialist that joined us and she is going to be the heir apparent to elena martinez shes probably not going to beat e martinez out this fall for the libero spot but has put a lot of pressure on her and thats made elena better michele williams is the other newcomer she actually graduated early in december of last year from high school and played with us all spring and trained and lifted and had an opportunity to adjust to the collegiate game so shes in this fall not missing a beat and shes ready to go
5895522 two surprises and great additions in terms of their progress from last year to this was brittney johnson who did a tremendous job for us last year but really didnt understand everything we needed her to understand running an offense she worked tremendously hard in the weight room and in the gym this past summer and shes a very welcome surprise in the level shes brought to the gym if we named a starting setter today she would be our starting setter we still have two more weeks of preseason and i dont know that it will stay that way but as of today shes done a great job and prepared and earned the opportunity the other great addition from last year is tania schatow we moved her to the right side from middle blocker she was the third middle blocker for us last year and really and truly was the hero in the ncaa match against new mexico state she came in after lauren degirolamo injured her foot tania has really matured into a great right side and i think she may be one of the best in the conference as well
5895523 our offense is fast furious and its fun we are very athletic and very fast our defense is very solid the question this year is going to be can we control the ball better than any team in the country we want to be the best serving and passing team in the country for the past week thats pretty much all weve done
5895524 were going for our fourth sec west championship thats not good enough for this team this team doesnt want to just be west champions they want to be sec champions at the end of the year they have the talent and the ability we have to put the attitude and the ball control together with that and i think we can accomplish that its a pretty big task but certainly theres an attitude in the gym that were going to be successful
5895525 we start at creighton with a very tough tournament minnesota texas a amp m and creighton
5895526 when elena and kyna came in i said that was the most heralded class we had in my tenure here and they have proven that to be true because of the level the program has elevated along with their play i think the fact that weve been able to recruit kids at a higher level and were in the recruiting pool with high level programs makes the difference coaches are only as good as the players on the court and weve been able to elevate our recruiting with higher level recruits and better athletes
5895527 intimidating a witness before a pending trial is very serious
5895528 the system can not work effectively without having our witnesses freely and voluntarily come forward to testify
5895529 they have been successful for the most part in some of their cases because witnesses who want to come forward are scared for their lives

5895535 ive learned a lot about people ive learned a lot about myself really and ive learned that we should extend each other a little bit more grace before we judge people and the biggest thing that ive learned is just that god has a plan and even though its not what i planned his play will always prevail

5895543 he has made some bad choices in the company he keeps
5895544 new york city miami we have a large vote here in favor of israel and no politician wants to run against it
5895545 sen obamas longstanding commitment to israel is clear to anyone who has reviewed his voting record read his speeches or looked at his policy papers
5895546 neither sen clinton nor sen obama agrees with every position their advisers take and in this case sen obama disagrees with general mcpeaks comments
5895547 the last time i spoke to obama was in the winter of 2004 at a gathering in chicagos hyde park neighborhood
5895548 as he came in and took off his coat i went up to greet him
5895549 he is merely doing what is necessary to get elected and he will continue doing it as long as it keeps him in power
5895550 the idea that supporters of israel have somehow distorted u s foreign policy or that they are responsible for the debacle in iraq is just wrong
5895551 he has made some bad choices in the company he keeps
5895552 if this is how we are to judge a candidate then sen obama still has a lot of explaining to do
5895553 ni mho he plantejat potser t algun inconvenient per t atractius com la complicitat de les dones del lloc

5895558 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5895559 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5895560 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat

5895564 i had a big big weekend i got married to portia de rossi sorry john stamos this ones taken
5895565 we use the word bias in certain areas of our study but we also talk about blind spots
5895566 people are operating on assumptions of what old is and what elderly patients need
5895567 we were surprised that this was a recurrence of something we saw in the late 1990s this is something we have to revisit periodically
5895568 and we want to share it with other states and ems systems because if its happening in maryland its likely happening everywhere
5895569 trauma is often seen as a disease of the young
5895570 but thats changing you have a fairly active aging population that is playing sports being active and getting injured
5895571 no one ever admits they have a bias they say they know someone who does something biased
5895572 basically its difficult to get a handle on what bias is so instead of defining bias we wanted to show that people behaved differently and find a way to fix the problem
5895573 sometimes the younger doctors see a person being evaluated and it turns out to be negative and the patient is sent home

5895617 unfortunately the economy continues to worsen and we must reduce expenses further
5895618 we are starting to see a trend investors are picking up the homes and turning them into the rental market right away we have not seen the foreclosures drive up rents anywhere right now
5895619 the foreclosed homes are being bought and rented out and not being sold for owner occupancy
5895620 our code enforcement officers have had a significant increase in the number of cases they are handling this ordinance will help us quickly determine who the property owner or manager is and work with them to resolve problems and concerns before they deteriorate

5895623 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
5895624 the geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what youre effectively doing is pumping water below ground where its heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station
5895625 if you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the coast could be comparable to coal
5895626 if on the other hand youre talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central australia and then building large transmission lines to adelaide and sydney the costs are going to be too expensive
5895627 in theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and theyve got to move onto another field
5895628 then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field
5895629 because it was devoted to the actual tactics as the cia people were demanding a golden shield that would protect them from later prosecutions and only a memo approving specific tactics could do that
5895630 he read and was horrified by torture memos after he was put in charge of the olc and long before he wrote the transfer memo he is convicted out of his own mouth
5895631 his goldsmiths admission that he read the second still secret memo that detailed specific interrogation techniques being used by the cia makes it flatly impossible that he did not know or suspect what was going on when he wrote the transfer memo
5895632 was used to facilitate the ghost detainee program in which various prisoners were hidden from the international red cross so that nobody would learn that they were prisoners
5895633 and contrary to the geneva conventions i gather their status health and whereabouts were not disclosed to their families
5895634 by not formally accusing them in any judicial way we could according to goldsmith transfer them out of iraq because formally they were not yet accused persons although in fact our government had already accused and convicted them every way but sideways this is true dissembling this is true reliance on minimal form over gigantic substance and this is exactly what jack goldsmith did in his memo of march 19 2004
5895635 until the time came to garner publicity in september 2007 for his new book
5895636 goldsmith was an enabler of evil including evil and crime justified by the tortured rationalizations of lawyers who set out to provide legal cover for torture for cruelly inhuman conduct and other horrors
5895637 whether lawyers in order to justify and provide a basis for supporting vicious and illegal actions of the government are free to assert the most outlandish arguments in favor of these actions are free to invent astonishing even evil arguments in favor of the positions are free to facilitate the governments evil actions and not to counsel against the positions even though the positions and actions are in violation of domestic criminal laws in violation of international law contrary to the american constitutional system and taken without consideration of the traditions and values of this country
5895638 gravely illegal conduct in this way would be subject to disbarment subject to criminal prosecution and disqualified from being on any respectable law school faculty

5895643 a large fraction of americans know that we need a jeffersonian political revolution to fix our corrupt system they were not fooled by the obama rhetoric about change not from someone that has been a product of and servant for the two party plutocracy yes all the votes for me and the other third party presidential candidates spelled the difference between obama winning and losing our voters correctly protested against the corrupt two party system they did not elect mccain only those who voted for mccain elected him and that is something they must live with as they watch a mccain administration continue dismantling american democracy and budget busting global warmongering
5895644 it is time to stop saying god bless america and begin repeating god save america the good news is that we will build even greater public support for a true political revolution during the mccain presidency all too often things must get much worse before they can get better they will get worse

5895663 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5895664 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5895665 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5895666 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5895667 one cannot avoid the inevitable this adage came to mind when i read the pronouncement by irans islamic revolutionary guards corps commander mohammad ali jafari who said my country is easily capable of closing the straits of hormuz the main passageway for oil freighters if the country is attacked due to its nuclear program
5895668 in my estimation confronting this country which is trying to gain the time necessary to acquire nuclear weapons is unavoidable
5895669 history has taught us that ideological countries only pay heed to victory over their ideology they never accept any halfway situation even when they find themselves on the brink of disaster
5895670 the absolute priority must be our strategic security in the gulf
5895671 confrontation is the solution and there is no solution but confrontation
5895672 perhaps it is a strange coincidence that this time around our strategic interests coincide with those of iran is our enemy and at the same time it is an enemy not just of
5895673 in politics nothing prevents you from allying with the devil for the sake of your interests this is what confronting the iranian danger which is close demands of us this issue in my estimation cannot suffer delay or hesitation every passing day benefits

5895680 i lean to nintendos side since the patents are registered to some dude in carson city nevada but anascape is registered in texas famous for their friendly attitude toward patent trolls i think its a case of jury shopping
5895681 or its a case of choosing a venue where the judge knows a patent from a potato where the magistrates are experienced with patent matters for expedited pretrial proceedings and where the docket that isnt clogged with federal criminal cases that prevent timely resolution of civil matters
5895682 actually e d tex is so popular with patent infringement plaintiffs because it hands down victory after victory for plaintiffs on questionable procedural rulings and blatant plaintiff favoritism why sit down its story time

5895712 the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it communion to him
5895713 if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives
5895714 a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5895715 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5895716 not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5895717 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5895718 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion

5895739 childrens eyes are particularly vulnerable to exposure and subsequent damage from blue light as they are born with relatively clear lenses the amount of blue light reaching the retina at the back of the eye is greater in infants and young children than in adults
5895740 it protects the retina and reduces the chances of macular degeneration therefore providing the eyes with a window of protection
5895741 i would advise mothers to feed their babies exclusively with breast milk for the first six months that will give them the protection they need of course the mother also needs to eat more fruits and vegetables which is another source of lutein to increase the level of lutein in her breast milk

5895781 whether you actually had to ask gatherer for the tribute
5895782 youre inquisitive no i didnt have to ask for the tribute it was obvious thats what i was there for they hadnt paid taxes in four years not eight and in his presentation speech gatherer spoke eloquently and with feeling of scummy bandits who have prevented any tribute caravans from reaching our illustrious capital city during that time

5895880 but make no mistake robert mckee is a tyrant a story tyrant here to spread his gospel of storytelling to reclaim the age old craft that of finding truth through words from its universal decline like all tutorials mckees resonates theres no getting around its message if you dont work at the craft of writing if you dont educate yourself about it if you dont suffer over every word youll never execute a story worthy of an audience a weekend being blasted by the force of nature that is robert mckee is a weekend spent in a whirlwind one that ultimately deposits a writer on her doorstep feeling charged with new conviction because story indeed is art and truth
5895881 at the heart of mckees writing philosophy is humanity thats refreshing in a world of video game movies and paint by numbers spectacle mckees lectures combine dramaturgy philosophy an emphasis on classical roots and writing advice about constructing a script from the inside out advice thats rigorous and helpful but what made it fresh what made it inspiring was the way it was woven together a robert mckee theory of story
5895882 i took the robert mckee course it was insightful concise im a huge believer
5895883 mckees story seminar is incredibly helpful i won the pulitzer prize for feature writing and found that what i learned in mckees course was a huge help in structuring the story the course shaped the way i approached writing and played a huge part in my career

5895895 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
5895896 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
5895897 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team

5895902 that would have been a tough thing to go through i kind of went through that i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
5895903 i think the last three or four months have been very humbling for chris
5895904 the week since the charges were dropped and his phone didnt ring i think that was also humbling
5895905 once off suspension well have an opportunity to see whether or not hed be a positive addition to the football team and go from there
5895906 i think time wise were going to be ok with that
5895907 im not sure how im going to make all that work once we get those guys back come september its a challenge to get everyone work but well do the best we can

5895914 this federal indictment one of the first in the country to target a manufacturer of spyware computer software is particularly important because of the damage done to peoples privacy by these insidious programs
5895915 programs such as loverspy exist solely to latch onto computer equipment for the purpose of stealing personal and financial information law enforcement must continue to take action against the manufacturers of these programs to protect unsuspecting victims and seek punishment for those responsible for wreaking havoc online
5895916 what the promoters of loverspy didnt know was that while they were watching their victims law enforcement was watching them
5895917 the internet must remain a safe place for all to enjoy without fear of identity theft and or loss of privacy and therefore the fbi will continue to aggressively pursue those who compromise the privacy of innocent victims through the utilization of spyware

5895931 an individual who did no more than cut the hair of female inmates before they were executed cannot be found to have assisted in the persecution of civilians on the other hand there can be no question that a guard who was issued a uniform and armed with a rifle and a pistol who was paid a stipend and was regularly allowed to leave the concentration camp to visit a nearby village and who admitted to shooting at escaping inmates on orders from the commandant of the camp fits within the statutory language about persons who assisted in the persecution of civilians

5895946 and allah has set forth an example for those who believe the wife of firawn when she said
5895947 firawn was the most tyrannical and disbelieving person on earth and by allah his disbelief did not affect his wife when she decided to obey her lord
5895948 firawns wife was tortured in the heat of the sun when her torturers would take a break and walk away the angels would shade her with their wings and she would see her home in paradise
5895949 firawns wife asked who won and it was said to her

5895961 this happened three years ago to another transgender woman whats to say it wont start happening again once all of the attention goes away
5895962 he will probably do this again but at least this is making it known in the gay community i dont think a lot of people really knew he was like this before its also making moore aware that the city is watching him
5895963 dont bother coming to this club this club discriminates against transgenders they hate he shes they will kick you out for stupid shit like being a female in a mans body
5895964 this bar used to be good it still looks the same as it did back in the late 80s amp early 90s but dont be fooled this bar barely has any crowd except maybe a few ugly regulars like the guy said before me the owner is rude and an ass and that front bartender is also rude and a nelly pretentious queen i guess they pull in all their business on tuesday nite because it never has a full house the parking sucks the miracle of it all is how this club has managed to stay open maybe the straight strippers have to pay a percentage of their take i live in dallas and i always skip this bar
5895965 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states
5895966 it is not an act of the united states or the european union or anyone else to isolate russia it is what russia is doing
5895967 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave under the six principle agreement signed by president saakashvili and president medvedev
5895968 i would say with respect to the russian disposition that we dont see much change in the forces that were there
5895969 there can be no business as usual with russia while this kind of activity goes on
5895970 this document is a very clear statement that this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe between those who were fortunate enough to make it into the transatlantic structures and those who still aspire to those transatlantic structures

5895977 what is the natural reaction when someone slaps you you feel like slapping him back right but the supernatural reaction is both counterintuitive and counterreactive jesus taught us to turn the other cheek this of it as spiritual aikido we absorb the sinful energy of others and convert it into a righteous response so persecution becomes a catalyst for prayer hatred inspires love and we convert curses into blessings

5895979 youre talking less than a point of being in the final which makes it even more difficult to take
5895980 i was nervous which is kind of typical at least for me
5895981 at the beginning of the match i was kind of tight i was probably being more careful than what i normally am i was a little bit leery of trying to shade
5895982 i wanted to shoot in a condition but it was just coming and going the condition wouldnt stay there
5895983 it wasnt until about halfway through the match that i loosened up a little bit and started to shade more often
5895984 if i had done that in the beginning i might have fared a little better but shading is kind of risky theres no science to it or formula that you can figure out its just an instinct type kind of shooting
5895985 that hurt thats just tough to take ive been training hard i think i performed pretty decently today maybe i was a little too tentative and a little too careful and i probably shouldve been shading from the very start
5895986 ill never forget the experience in 04 but this has been a great experience too
5895987 what more can you ask for than another chance to represent the united states and the u s army you cant ask for anything more than that
5895988 i love representing the united states and representing the u s
5895989 we did all the tourist stuff then the great wall the silk market and all the shopping
5895990 this time ive been trying to stay focused we have our apartment where were all staying in the olympic village and between there the dining facility and the range thats where ive been this whole shooting complex is just a beautiful facility they really did a great job of putting it together
5895991 theres so much emotion going on right now that its a tough decision to make but this will probably be my last olympics ive been doing this for a long time now its time to do something else maybe something still within the sport of shooting a coaching job or something like that
5895992 i dont even want to say because i hate to be one of those who comes out of retirement
5895993 its tough to do especially in this sport where you can do it as long as you have the desire to compete and i still have the desire to compete i just dont know to put four years of your life into an hour and 15 minutes thats hard to do
5895994 we do a lot of family stuff but maybe its time to start focusing on them more and what they want to do in life
5895995 the youngest one loves to shoot and i want to be able to give him the time that my dad was able to give me which you have to start at a young age i think its time to give back a little not only to my own kids but to other shooters
5895996 if there is a coaching job available at the u s army marksmanship unit i will definitely apply for that position
5895997 with my military background i think it would be a good fit and there are probably a couple other opportunities that will be available when i retire
5895998 ive been with the amu off and on my whole career
5895999 ive done tours in korea for 14 months and four years in fort hood texas i also went to airborne school ranger school and all the other army officer schools
5896000 the world class athlete program is just a superb program
5896001 its just an amazing opportunity that the army provides and a lot of people dont know that opportunity exists it just exemplifies what the military is all about it wants soldiers to be successful and thats one of the ways it provides an opportunity for a soldier to be successful in something that he loves to do

5896008 i think the world is too large too huge and the problems too great for someone to come in on the job training i think because of her years in the white house in the senate have given her the opportunity to explore and to see what is needed for this country
5896009 we cannot base our decision on our shared ethnicity but the experience we have and while sen obama is very qualified theres the experience that comes with senator clinton shes the one thats going to put our country back on track raised by a woman i think a woman can do it
5896010 at a certain point we needed to make a decision on whether to continue to compete in states that werent likely to pay off and drain money from states that could
5896011 mr obama definitely has to deal with the issues of the inner city he definitely has to come up with an urban agenda that will address the problems of poverty and inner city schools and education otherwise he may not energize black voters to the extent that they need to be energized

5896133 semenjak anakku meninggal dunia loohoe sebenarnya tak ingin menggunakan senjata lagi
5896134 akan tetapi kalau aku tetap melayani dengan tangan kosong aku berlaku kurang hormat terhadap para pendekar boe tong
5896135 si tua telah merobohkan sorang tokoh hwa san pay dan tiga jago siauw lim
5896136 dia juga sudah bertempur melawan sio ko dan aku adalah lawannya yang kelima jika aku tidak memperoleh kemenangan di mana aku harus menaruh muka boe tong pay

5896142 hari ini kita menunda permusuhan antara boe tong dan pek bie kauw sekarang ini adalah saat yang memutuskan dalam pergulatan antara enam partai dan beng kauw maka itu kami dari boe tong pay menantang pihak beng kauw

5896146 antara boe tong pay dan peh bie kauw terdapat permusuhan yang dalam bagaikan lautan tapi kami tidak ingin menggunakan kesempatan pada waktu musuh sedang menghadapi bahaya maka itu persoalan ini dapat ditunda dan diperhitungkan di kemudian hari tujuan dari enam partai adalah untuk menyerang beng kauw peh bie kauw sudah memisahkan diri dari beng kauw dan kenyataan ini sudah diketahui oleh semua orang perlu apa in loocianpwee turut menceburkan diri kuharap loocianpwee suka mengajak semua anggota peh bie kauw dan turun dari gunung ini

5896153 mengapa harimau itu tak mau terbang menubruk musuhnya apabila si harimau akan berbuat begitu bukankah dia akan mendapat kemenangan
5896154 ilmu silat locianpwee tinggi luar biasa dan boanpwee merasa takluk
5896155 sekarang loohoe mengakui bahwa semenjak dahulu ciang hoat ilmu pukulan dengan tangan kosong dari boe tong pay tiada tandingannya di dalam dunia

5896162 dia telah mematahkan kaki tangan tong sam tee aku akan mematahkan juga kaki tangannya ini yang dinamakan pembayaran tunai
5896163 sebelum berangkat ke see heek enam partai telah membuat perserikatan dengan sumpah yang berat mengapa kau sekarang ingin melindungi si tua bangka dari mo kauw itu
5896164 sesudah kembali di tiong goan aku akan minta pengajaran dari cit siang koen mu
5896165 di dalam dunia orang tidak boleh melampui kepantasan biarpun boe tong pay lebih kuat daripada sekarang ia tidak boleh berbuat sewenang wenang

5896168 membakar ragaku api nan suci hidup apa senangnya mati apa susahnya
5896169 pendiri beng kauw seorang mulia hanya sayang pengikut pengikut nya yang belakangan menyeleweng dari jalan yang benar
5896170 kau ingin membunuh seorang yang sudah terluka berat apa kau tidak takut ditertawai
5896171 orang she cong apa jempolnya cit siang koen dari khong tong pay aku bersedia untuk menerima tiga serangmu

5896177 in loocianpwee mengatakan bahwa kedudukanmu belum cukup tinggi untuk bertanding dengannya kalau kau bisa menangkan aku barulah ia akan melayani kau
5896178 bocah kau sungguh tak menggenal mampus apa kau mau berkenalan dengan kelihaian cit siang koe dari khong tong pay
5896179 untuk mendamaikan kedua belah pihak jalan satu satunya ialah membuka rahasia kebusukan goan tin
5896180 kalau menggunakan kekerasan mana dapat aku melawan jago jago dari enam partai apapula para pamanku juga berada di sini mana bisa aku berhadapan dengan mereka sebagai musuh
5896181 kelihaian cit siang koang dari khong tong pay sudah diketahui olehku lama sekali bukankah pendeta suci siauw lim pay kong kian tay soe juga binasa karena pukulan itu
5896182 kong kian taysoe telah dibunuh oleh bangsat cia soen dan kenyataan ini diketahui di seluruh kalangan kang ouw
5896183 apakah kau menyaksikan dengan mata sendiri pada waktu cia cianpwee membinasakan kong kian seng ceng
5896184 waktu kong tian seng ceng meninggal dunia lok yang khong thong ngo loo berada di inlam sebagai tamu lioe tayhiap dari tiam cong pay
5896185 kalau benar waktu itu kau berada di in lam cara bagaimana kau bisa mengatakan dengan pasti bahwa kong kian seng ceng dibunuh cia cianpwee adalah sebuat kenyataan yang tidak bisa dibantah lagi bahwa kong kian taysu binasa karena pukulan cit siang koen cia cianpwee bukan orang khong tong pay mana boleh kau menuduh orang secara serampangan
5896186 sesudah membunuh kong kian taysoe di atas tembok binatang cia soen menulis huruf huruf seperti berikut seng koen membinasakan kong kian taysoe huruf huruf itu ditulis dengan darah sesudah diketahui umum bahwa dengan menggunakan nama gurunya cia soen sudah melakukan pembunuhan di berbagai tempat

5896188 kong tie taysoe bukankah soohengmu binasa karena pukulan cit siang koen apakah tidak benar jika aku mengatakan bahwa cit siang koen serupa ilmu yang tidak pernah diturunkan oleh orang partai kong tong pay
5896189 bocah suruhan siapa kau apakah manusia serendah kau mau coba mengadu lidah dengan guruku
5896190 tugasmu di hari ini adalah mendamaikan permusuhan di antara enam partai dan beng kauw kau tak boleh merusak segala apa karena kepentingan pribadi sakit hati terhadap siauw lim pay dapat dibereskan di hari kemudian
5896191 bocah jika kau kaki tangan mo kauw panjangkan lehermu untuk menerima kebinasaan tapi kalau kau tiada sangkut pautnya dengan agama siluman itu menyingkirlah dari gunung ini secepat mungkin sebagai orang pertapaan kami takkan mencelakai kau
5896192 dalam partaimu terdapat seorang yang dikenal sebagai goan tin taysoe cobalah minta keluar aku ingin ajukan beberapa pertanyaan
5896193 jika kau ingin bicara lekaslah kami tak punya banyak waktu untuk mendengari segala obrolanmu siapakah gurumu
5896194 aku bukan mengikuti beng kauw dan juga bukan murid dari sesuatu partai di daerah tiong goan
5896195 akan tetapi aku mempunyai sangkut paut dengan beng kauw boe tong siauw lim go bie koen loen dan hwa san pay untuk bicara terus terang gerakan enam partai untuk membalas beng kauw adalah karena perbuatan seorang jahat di dalam itu terselip suatu salah mengerti yang sangat hebat biarpun masih berusia muda aku tahu seluk beluk persoalannya maka itu dengan memberanikan hati aku minta kedua belah pihak menghentikan pertempuran menyelidiki soal ini sampai ke dasar dasarnya supaya siapa yang salah siapa yang benar menjadi terang dan kemudian membereskan permusuhan ini seadil adilnya
5896196 ha ha ha he he he he hi hi hi
5896197 otaknya miring dia rupanya mengganggap dirinya seperti thio cinjin dari boe tong pay atau kong beon seng ceng dari siauw lim pay
5896198 dia mimpi memperoleh to ling to dan menjadi yang termulia dalam rimba persilatan
5896199 ha ha ha dia anggap kita seperti anak kecil aduh aku tertawa sampai perutku sakit

5896201 kau tahu bahwa goan tin soeheng tidak berada di sini dan kau sengaja menyeretnya mengapa kau tidak mengambil thio coei san dari boetong untuk dijadikan pesakitan
5896202 thio coei san cari penyakit sendiri dan dibikin mabuk oleh perempuan siluman
5896203 begitu lekas aku bunuh salah seorang dari rombongan enam partai itu aku bermusuhan dengan mereka semua dan aku tak dapa memainkan peranan sebagai pendamai lagi
5896204 jika aku gagal permusuhan hebat ini tidak akan bisa dibereskan lagi
5896205 if in the land which the lord your god gives you to possess any one is found slain lying in the open country and it is not known who killed him then your elders and your judges shall come forth and they shall measure the distance to the cities that are around him that is slain and the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer which has never been worked and which has not pulled in the yoke

5896207 youre not supposed to take the bible literally its a divinely inspired metaphor a history of an evolving understanding of god over the ages not all christians are fundamentalists and its unfair to critique all christianity based on a literal interpretation that many of us dont adhere to
5896208 if youre going to cherrypick your sacred text how do you decide which parts are divinely inspired and which parts are human error and if youre deciding just by using your own instinct and judgment rooted in the morals of your society then how is your sacred text any different from any other book of philosophy or history or guidance where you take what you need and leave the rest
5896209 ingrid keeps saying that i have to be fair that i have to remember the time and place this was written and not judge people with a bronze age view of the world from my own modern perspective
5896210 this is what our holiest book of laws requires no more no less
5896211 if you do something bad you have to sacrifice something
5896212 so some time before now this man was killed with some kind of stone implement and no one saw them do it the perfect crime
5896213 if in the land which the lord your god gives you to possess any one is found slain lying in the open country and it is not known who killed him then your elders and your judges shall come forth and they shall measure the distance to the cities that are around him that is slain and the elders of the city which is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer which has never been worked and which has not pulled in the yoke
5896214 so just when we thought things couldnt get any worse
5896215 weve had to say goodbye to our drummer jon for various reason i guess if your close to the band youll find out why if not then i cant really be bothered to explain
5896216 so 51wc will be on hiatus while we work all this shit out and try to start again
5896217 we have a great laugh ourselves just doing it it is kids doing adult comedy so its a bit different in that respect from other shows but i think the most important thing is for everyone to have a good time
5896218 last year was amazing we were just getting so many people in and to do it again is a real dream come true
5896219 i was very lucky to get involved really ms lawson was running an after school club where people could get together and just try improvisational routines shed worked as a comedian before and just gave us scripts to read and try out ideas with we got the chance to perform the act at school and its just all developed from there
5896220 all the material starts really with the improv games we played with ms lawson we got to explore each character we created and try out different settings and situations to build workable scenes its a real group collaboration
5896221 we spend every day with each other really and its still always a lot of fun its good to share this weird experience because were still only really children at this adult festival
5896222 there is a worry we might just be seen as a novelty we definitely dont want to be just some kids doing adult comedy were all really proud of what weve created and hope people come with an open mind
5896223 the idea of our work being on tv is amazing it would be incredible to do more but youve got to have that ultimate goal
5896224 coping with school work as well isnt really a problem nobodys forcing us to do anything this is something we choose to do were all committed and we love it
5896225 un triunfo impecable de argentina para tomarse revancha para gozar al cl sico rival para disfrutar
5896226 keep the sand in the sand table dont pour that sand out stop that immediately were going inside if you dont stop that right now
5896227 whom have i in heaven but you i desire you more than anything on earth my health may fail and my spirit may grow weak but god remains the strength of my heart he is mine forever those who desert him will perish for you destroy those who abandon you but as for me how good it is to be near god love that i have made the sovereign lord my shelter and i will tell everyone about the wonderful things you do
5896228 therefore since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith let us strip off every weight that slows us down especially the sin that so easily trips us up and let us run with endurance the race god has set before us
5896229 following my arrest i was taken back to the parisian crime department for questioning
5896230 throughout my apartment bone fragments and human teeth were scattered about like loose change vertebras and leg bones hung from the ceiling like morbid mobiles and hundreds of videocassettes mostly slasher and hardcore s amp m flicks filled my shelves one can only imagine what went through the minds of the investigators as they looked around my living quarters on one wall hung a bullet riddled target while across the room sat a tv set with jars of human ashes resting on top of it several bondage magazines were piled in a far corner and nearby my backpack was found which contained handcuffs surgical instruments and duct tape in addition to my tastes and choice of d cor investigators also discovered several stolen blood bags inside of my refrigerator

5896258 research published today in the journal of the american medical association has linked the ancient poison to type 2 diabetes a disease that has reached pandemic proportions and now accounts for 1 in every 10 american dollars spent on healthcare and trace amounts of naturally occurring arsenic seem to be contributing to the problem and endangering some americans without their knowledge experts say
5896259 theres a take home message for many americans while utility companies are required by law to keep arsenic levels in drinking water below 10 parts per billion fewer safeguards exist for the approximately 15 percent of americans who quench their thirst with water from private wells so many people may have high levels of arsenic in their water and not realize it says ana navas acien a physician and epidemiologist at johns hopkins university who is the studys lead author
5896260 the good news a cheap lab test typically only 20 to 35 can determine whether a households well is contaminated if it is water filters or other water quality improvement strategies can remedy the problem
5896261 either candidate would be progressive on the issue of climate change
5896262 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
5896263 clintons think mccain would be a better president than o they said that
5896264 b i ll doesnt give a fck about jmacs energy plan he doesnt even believe his own statement he just wants jmc to win so that h can try again in 2012 so he drops hints and inuendo and insult i will never ever vote for h after this blatant display of treachery and disloyalty
5896265 i wonder whether bill clinton remembers the time he won with 43 votes in 1992 could he have won if a democrat ex president had praised his republican opponent instead of working for bills win when voters had doubt of an unknown governor from arkansas if bill doesnt love himself so much he would have worked for obama to help him win this time as bill had gone through the same doubt but instead bill is working to undermine obama whenever possible its clear bill doesnt want anyone to make history just like himself poor soul
5896266 bill continues to get vilified imagine if he had said the following at any point
5896267 i would have to think about it i e supporting clinton if she is the nominee
5896268 its been 23 years since i first came here but i still love doing it i dont think i could ever miss it now
5896269 this years been really relaxing so far actually especially being here with my family
5896270 im usually up at 5 30am now for the baby which used to be the time id get in when i was here a few years ago i can almost see the ghost of my past self as i go out the door
5896271 the show is really for a tv series thats been four years in the pipeline theres old and new material in there it might seem a bit bitty but the audiences are responding well
5896272 im back on bbc2 now its ratings are down 50
5896273 im even getting on with the executives this time im so old now they leave me alone to do what i want really like a real grown up
5896274 and just as good actors as it turns out it all started as a joke really to cast simon as elizabeth but he does actually play it really well its almost scary
5896275 there are two bad things with this years festival the first is the failure of the website all the organisers had to do was create a website that worked distribute the program and sell tickets and they couldnt do any of that and thats discouraged the lovely little people with their flasks and sandwiches who come up and fill shows and allow interesting acts to be discovered
5896276 the edinburgh comedy festival has also effectively introduced a two tier system this year its a nice sane thing to have everyone together on the same footing but this separates the big acts from the smaller ones and is destroying much of whats good about the festival for awful marketing reasons
5896277 i did it with real talent who have been great and im really pleased with the way its turned out its sold more in the first week than my first dvd ever did
5896278 of course with the internet now you can cut out the middleman who can often be an obstruction or a filter with my what would judas do show radio 4 were interested in recording and selling a version of it but with all their conditions it just wasnt worth it with go faster i was able to make more money and have complete control over the recording
5896279 i mean you can get now 4 dvds with peter kay doing the same material in four different venues but youre not able to find something by simon munnery anywhere musics always being recorded and sold or downloaded no matter who or how old it is
5896280 its just good to have your stuff archived its certainly helpful to have 90 minutes of material out there that will always be around it keeps you motivated from 1997 to 2001 i was doing pretty much the same show as there was no real incentive to move on
5896281 its like being upset at a dog shitting in the gutter
5896282 i see people like jerry sadowitz who does material that even almost even shocks me a little but he does it all in such a way where he just seems to take such little joy or pleasure in what hes saying and its brilliant its important to have the right tone when it comes to controversy
5896283 they should just do what they want but sometimes its only really the comedian who can or will challenge topics that need to be challenged if you look to america the only real music star saying something significant against the government is neil young whos now in his 70s its taking younger comedians to stand up and say something
5896284 w e have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment
5896285 w e have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment
5896286 it sounds like that were not better off is what youre saying
5896287 i think we are better off overall if you look at the entire eight year period when you look at the millions of jobs that have been created the improvement in the economy et cetera
5896288 what im trying to emphasize anderson that we are in a very serious challenge right now with a lot of americans very uncertain about their future and weve got to give them some comfort
5896289 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
5896290 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
5896291 remarks by john mccain on his jobs for america economic plan
5896292 because thats a whole different part of the game building things and seeing how they perform and taking part in challenges
5896293 with you is out for those of you who have already purchased it on itunes and have started to spread the word thank you
5896294 these are perfect for juggling the right size and weight
5896295 mccain has been there all these years and weve seen diddly squat
5896296 dont you roll those eyes at me young lady or young man
5896297 his shoulders rippled upwards under the tight fabric of his coat and then relaxed back down again
5896298 his blond brows snapped together over a large nose that slanted just a bit downstage left
5896299 he actually laughed at that his stony expression melting abruptly into a smile that sent the heat from her face tingling all over her body

5896311 health plans should not be allowed to apply unfair treatment limitations or financial requirements on mental health benefits
5896312 this is not a simple question but the current answer is also not an effective solution to the problem
5896313 these higher education leaders have signed their names to a public statement that the 21 year old drinking age is not working and specifically that it has created a culture of dangerous binge drinking on their campuses
5896314 this is not only a bad idea this is a horrendous idea lowering the drinking age makes the underage drinking problem even worse
5896315 when the drinking age went up to 21 there were fewer alcohol related health problems and fewer fatal car crashes

5896326 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of god
5896327 blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
5896328 blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account rejoice and be glad for your reward is great in heaven for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you

5896338 attempting to rebut a legal ruling with non legal arguments is insulting to the readers of the providence journal brashly it underestimates the ability of the residents of ri to discern points of law from other realities of life the high court in ri said the lead paint public nuisance litigation had no merit that is a point of law yes the realities of life tend to be that justice is not always kind in addition large corporations tend to have more resources to invest in litigation than does a government entity like the ri attorney generals office thats exactly why the authors of this op ed motley rice attorneys were brought in on a contingency basis to assist with the litigation had the state prevailed motley rice would have earned 16 percent of abatement funds since the plaintiffs abatement proposal was in the billions motley rice had plenty to earn also no newsflash low income children tend to live in older residential units i was one of the children in a downtown jersey city new jersey tenement my grandmother and mother intervened they had the property owner paint over the blue flaking paint i was chewing that took care of that last friday at the ri superior court hearing before judge michael silverstein on reimbursement of certain costs to the defendants assistand attorney general neil kelly also decried the ri sc decision in an interview on that hearing with ap reporter eric tucker so did jack mcconnell odd that those with law licenses would argue legal points by introducing everything but points of law all attorneys not just government and plaintiff ones might feel a sense of shame that members of the bar are behaving in what i perceive to be an unprofessional manner

5896375 siapa yang menjalankan qiyam ramadhan karena beriman dan mengharapkan pahala dari allah maka dosa dosanya yang telah lalu akan diampuni
5896376 rasulullah saw tidak pernah menambahi baik pada bulan ramadhan maupun selain bulan ramadhan dari sebelas rakaat
5896377 saya bertanya wahai rasulullah apakah anda tidur sebelum sholat witir
5896378 wahai aisyah sesungguhnya kedua mataku tidur tapi hatiku tidak tidur
5896379 nabi saw sholat malam dan saya tidur terlentang diatas tempat tidurnya apabila beliau hendak sholat witir beliau membangungkan saya kemudian saya sholat witir
5896380 islam itu didirikan atas lima sendi mengakui bahwa tidak ada tuhan selain allah dan bahwa muhammad adalah rasul allah mendirikan sholat mengeluarkan zakat berpuasa ramadhan dan mengunjungi baitullah
5896381 sesungguhnya seorang lelaki bertanya kepada nabi dia berkata ya rasulullah terangkanlah kepadaku tentang puasa yang diwajibkan allah atas diriku nabi menjawabnya bulan ramadhan orang itu bertanya pula apakah ada puasa yang lain lagi yang diwajibkan kepadaku nabi menjawab tidak terkecuali engkau mengerjakan puasa sunat

5896385 telah berfirman allah azza wajalla tiap tiap amal bani adam adalah untuknya sendiri selain daripada puasa puasa itu untuk ku dan aku sendiri yang akan mengganjarinya puasa itu perisai karena itu apabila seseorang kamu sedang berpuasa janganlah ia menurutkan perkataan yang buruk yang keji dan yang membangkitkan syahwat dan janganlah pula ia membuat keributan atau keonaran apabila ia dimaki atau ditantang oleh seseorang hendaklah ia berkata saya sedang berpuasa
5896386 puasa itu perisai selama tidak dinodainya dengan dusta atau dengan makian
5896387 bukanlah puasa itu hanya dari makan dan minum semata namun puasa itu berlepas diri dari perkataan perkataan kotor dan makian
5896388 barang siapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan zur yakni dusta mengumpat memfitnah seluruh perkataan yang mendatangkan kemarahan allah dan bersengketa membuat kerusakan keonaran dan tidak pula meninggalkan pekerjaan pekerjaan itu maka allah tidak akan menerima puasa orang itu
5896389 barang siapa berpuasa karena dari rasa kepercayaannya dan kewajibannya kepada tuhannya maka tuhan akan mengampuni segala macam dosa yang telah diperbuatnya
5896390 beberapa banyak orang yang berpuasa namun tidak ada baginya melainkan hanya lapar dan haus semata
5896391 barang siapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan keji dan melakukan kejahatan allah tidak akan menerima puasanya sekalipun ia telah meninggalkan makan dan minum
5896392 telah datang kepadamu bulan ramadhan bulan yang diberkati allah memerintahkan kamu berpuasa didalamnya didalam bulan ramadhan dibukakan semua pintu syorga dikuncikan semua pintu neraka dan dibelenggukan semua syaithan

5896418 i am so happy that ian got an olympic medal at last
5896419 congratulations to the canadian team for a job well done and a medal thats well deserved
5896420 i was live streaming this event at work and i started crying when ian went clear
5896421 existing organization blogs and websites only provide a little information at best making it difficult to gain a complete view of what you need to get the job done
5896422 closetsguru com is meant to be a one stop shop offering a comprehensive database of knowledge for individuals who want to organize anything from a messy bedroom closet to a cluttered garage
5896423 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5896424 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
5896425 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5896426 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5896427 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5896428 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5896429 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5896430 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5896431 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5896432 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5896433 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5896434 the liberal dark decade is over the conservative government is getting tough on drug crime so that hard working canadians and their families dont have to pay the price for this despicable trade
5896435 i broke every law on the planet to get more dope
5896436 what got me clean was a hammer over my head
5896437 these children have a very serious infection that is causing tissue necrosis the death of the tissue
5896438 its not like it is in older children and adults where its generally an invasive group a strep but indeed it is a necrotizing tissue destroying infection that theyve got
5896439 the review has not in any way turned up anything that would cause concern for mothers to be and the lethbridge region
5896440 if we had any concerns that there was something related to the hospital its dr mustos responsibility to shut the hospital down
5896441 in this particular incidence weve not been able to uncover the source of the infection
5896442 because its such an unusual event that there is two of these children that have such a significant infection we thought it wise to ask for another review of this and this is normal practice
5896443 because of the privacy act we need a formally signed consent form from the parents to release any information about the condition of the children
5896444 we dont have that and i dont think were going to be getting it
5896445 the concern is basically for a loss of effect for drugs and particularly those used in serious medical conditions
5896446 these are three serious medical conditions for which the drugs simply have to work properly
5896447 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5896448 and we have only a very rudimentary understanding of what these pumps do and what drugs they affect and what other drugs or foods might modulate these pumps
5896449 theres a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the implications are for the average person
5896450 the best thing to do in general to get the most consistent effect of your drug is to take it with a glass of water on an empty stomach
5896451 god will not lead us to anything that he can not lead us thru
5896452 the medias images of brangelina that are smelly and vile

5896454 we can stay in our cage end up with everything and realize it amounts to nothing or we can come out of our cage and chase the wild goose
5896455 blessed is the man who trusts in the lord whose confidence is in him he will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream it does not fear when heat comes its leaves are always green it has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit
5896456 maybe it isnt too late to fulfill my olympic dream
5896457 one generation and out we have no problems with the extinction of domestic animals they are creations of selective breeding
5896458 everyone should never buy a puppy from a pet store or via the internet nor from a breeder no matter how caring they appear to be we must take crucial steps to spay neuter all companion animals
5896459 the leading provider of information and assistance concerning animal welfare
5896460 happiness is not a destination its a journey and life is a journey as well
5896461 i think sexuality is a fluid thing and its becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that youre that way
5896462 that definitely motivates me to be more open about it especially because its something that im much more certain of now ive never been ashamed of it so if i can maybe influence other girls or guys who are going through the same thing to not be ashamed of it and to embrace their differences and at the same time to know that theyre not alone its a really beautiful thing and a beautiful opportunity that ive been given im much more at ease with it these days

5896524 oh jen lives in philadelphia where harriet tubman went to be free
5896525 i think as far as an offense this was our best scrimmage by far
5896526 we executed we didnt have a turnover tonight pass protection was there im not sure if we gave up any sacks no dropped balls i think we had one penalty this was a great way to finish off camp as far as an offense
5896527 i felt i had to play well because in the previous scrimmages i didnt do as well as i should of
5896528 so today i just had to come out and show i can play the performance i figure it help with the coaches and my confidence too
5896529 hes not a slim guy hes kind of heavy set he runs great routes but you dont expect him to jump on the horse but he did tonight we kind of busted some coverages and once the offense got the momentum going they just did well
5896530 i think we have a lot of speedy freshman big strong guys like laron byrd
5896531 theyre coming in making it tough for us theyre rotating every play so they got fresh bodies its making us tough on our dbs all of them have great talent if they keep rotating theyre going to be real good
5896532 right now just like it was for my first two years hes doing a phenomenal job making all the right checks thats his spot right now you just got to give it to who is performing the best right now
5896533 with xavier hes playing a new position he played tackle over there so hes picked it up hes quick he hasnt missed a beat hes graded out well in scrimmages
5896534 aj trump hes a guy if hes not starting hell be the sixth man hell play a lot he had a block that sprung a touchdown on the last play hes a guy thats been working real hard and shined
5896535 same old name keeps popping up marcus forston hes a hard worker hes playing real well for a freshman hes making a lot of plays
5896536 if i would have broken my c 4 the doctor told me i would have been paralyzed thats what i was told happened to kevin everett
5896537 i was kind of like laron byrd tearing it up each day out there
5896538 i really thought i was going to help this team big time
5896539 the fans really made me feel so much better they kept saying dont worry youll be back out there soon i know people say dont play for the fans play for yourself your teammates your school but ill always be a fan of canes fans for that day ill always play for them
5896540 for whatever reason he has progressed and when the lights are on and its a scrimmage like situation hes been able to pass the test and still he has a long way to go hes by no means a finished product hes still a freshman but at the same time hes been able to show up and make some plays clearly from the scrimmages hes been the most consistent guy

5896605 i dont think his loyalty would extend to violating the law or to blatantly misrepresenting something to a candidate or to the person who is employing him but i do think he would do whatever it took within those limits to protect someone he was loyal to

5896610 in terms of the social geography of the nineteenth century city the little streets and the alleys and lanes which developed off them became associated with a social pathology of deviant behaviour
5896611 a more sinister association was made between those committing nuisances in back lanes and a dark human underworld in which night pitch black rights of way and blind alleys drunken sailors prostitutes and larrikins lurking burglars and footpads and stinking piles of unidentifiable or unmentionable matter were all bound up in a fearful urban pathology

5896645 relato ficticio en el que figuran como elementos principales animales o cosas inanimadas personificadas cuyo fin es comunicar alguna moraleja en la biblia tenemos dos ejemplos 1 la de los rboles que escogen rey propuesta por jotam a los hombres de siquem jue 9 8 15 2 la del cedro del l bano y el cardo que jo s envi como respuesta al desaf o de amas as 2 r 14 9 las f bulas aludidas por los autores del nuevo testamento 1 ti 1 4 4 7 tit 1 14 2 p 1 16 que falsos maestros quer an introducir como verdades cristianas no parecen tener el car cter de f bula propiamente dicho sino de conceptos doctrinales inventados o ficticios
5896646 las f bulas son aquellas historias literarias en las que los personajes son siempre animales plantas u otros objetos inanimados que presentan caracter sticas humanas como por ejemplo en
5896647 16 porque no os hemos dado a conocer el poder y la venida de nuestro se or jesucristo siguiendo f bulas artificiosas sino como habiendo visto con nuestros propios ojos su majestad

5896654 pero el hombre natural no percibe las cosas que son del esp ritu de dios porque para l son locura y no las puede entender porque se han de discernir espiritualmente
5896655 teniendo el entendimiento entenebrecido por la dureza de su coraz n
5896656 que con mansedumbre corrija a los que se oponen por si quiz dios les conceda que se arrepientan para conocer la verdad y escapen del lazo del diablo en que est n cautivos a voluntad de l

5896672 la potenza delle fede non sta nella quantit le molte preghiere e le molte pratiche dei giudei non erano la vera fede fede attendere da dio e non da noi o dalle nostre opere la fede gratuit ed per questo che si esprime nella preghiera fede attendere da dio quello che egli vuole darci non dobbiamo ostinarci a voler essere noi la misura del progetto di dio dio la misura del dono non noi fede renderci disponibili perch dio ci apra alluniversalit delle genti la negazione della fede il ripiegamento su di s la gelosa conservazione del proprio privilegio
5896673 le parole pi meravigliose che il nuovo testamento ci abbia tramandato
5896674 di tanto esemplare nel bambino da spingere ges a collegarvi la condizione determinante per la salvezza
5896675 con tranquilla naturalezza respinge le prerogative divine considerandole una presunzione se in ges vi qualcosa di divino proprio questa sua umanit con la quale la sua persona viene determinata da dio e si fa portare da lui proprio questa limpida genuinit che non getta ombra tra la luce di dio e la vista degli esseri umani pi di ogni altra forma di vita da dio quella che rinuncia ad ogni pretesa di potere affinch diventi efficace il pi naturalmente possibile il potere che spetta a dio nel cuore di una persona veramente grandi sono soltanto le persone utili agli altri ma esse non vogliono regnare e rifiutano il potere in realt a desiderare il potere non sono che le quelle di meno valore ed regolarmente un danno per tutti quando ci si sottomette loro

5896686 education system is in crisis and failing the youth of today
5896687 the rest of the emerging world recognises this is the key to staying competitive
5896688 its time our political leaders acknowledged that and declare there is a crisis and do something about it

5896690 if you look at eastern europe china russia india latin america there is an increasing focus on education government leaders see that their competitiveness and the future of their country depends on the quality of their workforce and the education of their young people
5896691 we in the us have to recognise that and its not just the us japan the uk and western europe have the same challenges going forward
5896692 personal computers arent magic they are just a tool what you need to make the educational process work is a good teacher who is knowledgeable in the subject and can get kids excited

5896694 it works great as an educational tool and i know some schools have a class project to make pens and now they have around 30 electronic systems where this is used
5896695 so far we have affected 600 000 peoples lives and its allowing people to start a water sanitation business working mothers to start a seamstress business and people to start rice farms
5896696 my teachers were great educators with great after school programmes and pushing us to go beyond what we were doing

5896715 like most first time marathoners i sailed through 18 miles of my first marathon feeling like a million bucks by 21 miles i wasnt worth five cents i faded badly over those final six miles my second marathon was even worse
5896716 zijn hardlooppogingen heeft hij allang opgegeven zijn marathondromen leiden een vegeterend bestaan ik zwaai naar hem en keer mijn hoofd om zodat ik langzaam de concentratie kan opbouwen die nu nog week is en makkelijk kan loslaten maar hard en ondoordringbaar moet worden zodat ze me aan het einde van de marathon kan beschermen tegen de pijn die ik zal voelen
5896717 niemand begrijpt waarom ik hardloop en eerlijk gezegd zelf begrijp ik het ook nauwelijks of in ieder geval maar bij vlagen zon plotseling inzicht verschilt bovendien altijd weer van het vorige splijtende inzicht over de fundamentele redenen waarom ik ren maar ik hoef het ook niet te begrijpen en dat ik het niet hoef te begrijpen houdt me gaande
5896718 het gaat me in mijn hoofd makkelijk af maar onderweg voel ik dat mijn lichaam ook niet echt begrijpt waarom ik zoveel vrije tijd in dat stomme voortsjokken steek

5896729 ive been up that way a few times over the years
5896730 its an area perfect for this kind of research people have disappeared up there and never been found again so it makes sense these mysterious creatures could have gone unnoticed

5896732 im realistic even if i got a picture of a relic hominid on film i wouldnt publish it unless it was a1 clear but weve got a good team who know how to be quiet and sit down and wait for something to walk past so to speak

5896749 clearly they have to encourage first for people to be registered i would like to see and be involved in a major voter registration campaign i know senator obama is doing one but lets do one on top of his if you miss the deadline you cannot go in november and vote
5896750 what i think the hip hop community can do is record how many people they registered to vote and how many people they had that put obama and other elected officials over the top they can be a power horse in this election
5896751 the votes make a difference in peoples lives voters who stayed home in 2000 and 2004 might have put a different us attorney in gena louisiana that might have prevented mychal bell from going to jail the vote might not be seen today but it will be seen when you need it with civil rights laws better judges and people who have an understanding of the judiciary system

5896764 richard has some kind words for get on the bus in the course of arguing that education coverage needs traditional media sources because free standing education blogs could not provide the depth of coverage necessary for quality commentary on the issues without relying on traditional journalism
5896765 could bloggers take up the slack as papers cut education reporters not unless the bloggers are education reporters themselves
5896766 but more mainstream readers like the ones we write for want to know about the local schools and the states policy directives and these reports dont just materialize out of thin air thats what we as education reporters provide and blog about

5896802 this was something that we were only going to do one time we arent going to tour this record the entire band is a bunch of norwegians and they are all very busy they are all session guys and they do a lot of film work with everybodys schedule it was a really hard thing to pull off it is not something we will ever tour it wasnt a band per say it was more like a studio project the fact that we even accomplished playing a show live we thought it would be a good idea to film it it turned out good i was like we should put this out as a dvd so we did
5896803 pledger happened to be at one of the london shows he said you dont have to pay me i am going to do this whether you want the footage or not i was like okay no harm no foul then he sent us the footage it is fucking stunning he added a bunch of visual effects to it it is more than just a concert film there is some amazing animation in it it is really well done
5896804 here at the end of the millennium and extraordinary thing is happening in sports there is a new kind of athlete participating in a new kind of sport this new athlete competes not for fame or money or career but simply for adventure and for the experience of living if only for the span of the event at the very brink of human strength and endurance for this the athlete will travel literally to the ends of the earth to places so desolate and so devoid of the comforts of modern life they might be from a distant time or another planet what are these athletes looking for they are trying to discover what they are capable of doing as men and women without the assistance of the modern world they want to know extremity because there is life in risk and nobility in the breach they want to know nature not the tame woods of the park but nature raw where exposure is not an accident and where predators run free they are looking for all this and more everything within their skills and fitness as a sport and as a portal into this very beautiful and alien garden and they want to share it with teammates and friends who embrace their vision of a life lived fully

5896806 i was just doing what any of my colleagues would have done
5896807 i was the first one there and went in to make sure everyone was safe
5896808 the house was just destroyed the back left hand side of the building had completely gone it was just a pile of debris
5896809 i got the two guys who could get out out through the window
5896810 it was very dark and all i could see of the third man was his right arm sticking out of the rubble and the back of his head
5896811 there were massive chunks of concrete and debris everywhere i couldnt make out what had been a room or a wall
5896812 i just held his hand and talked to him he was covered in rubble and wood i couldnt move anything myself it was just too heavy and i didnt want to move it in case it caused the house to collapse more
5896813 there was debris still falling down and as far as we knew there was danger of further collapse and pc snell was brave to go in hes a hero
5896814 the back of the house was demolished and the front end had large cracks which were getting bigger as we were there
5896815 it was a miracle that third man could walk out with no serious injuries

5896823 to prevent the weaker numbers of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest commissioned to keep them down but as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock then any of the minor harpies it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws
5896824 whatever can be proved to be good must be so by being shown to be a means to something admitted to be good without proof the medical art is proved to be good by its conducing to health but how is it possible to prove that health is good the art of music is good for the reason among others that it produces pleasure but what proof is it possible to give that pleasure is good if then it is asserted that there is a comprehensive formula including all things which are in themselves good and that what ever else is good is not so as an end but as a mean the formula may be accepted or rejected but is not a subject of what is commonly understood by proof
5896825 es scheint mir aber nichts anders m glich als dass die zunahme der geistigen f higkeiten der bildung und der liebe zur unabh ngigkeit bei den arbeitenden klassen von einem entsprechenden wachstum des gesunden sinnes begleitet sein muss
5896826 sie sozialisten vergessen dass berall wo es keine konkurrenz gibt ein monopol besteht und dass ein monopol in allen formen eine steuer auf die erwerbst tigkeit zugunsten der unt tigkeit oder gar der raubgier ist sie vergessen ferner dass mit ausnahme der konkurrenz unter den arbeitern insofern dienlich ist als sie ihre verbrauchsgegenst nde verbilligt dass konkurrenz selbst auf dem arbeitsmarkt nicht die ursache eines niedrigen sondern eines hohen arbeitslohnes berall dort ist wo der wettbewerb in der nachfrage nach arbeit den wettbewerb im angebot der arbeit bersteigt wie in amerika in den kolonien und in gewerben mit gelernten arbeitskr ften sie vergessen ferner dass sie niemals einen grund niedrigen lohnes abgeben kann es sei denn durch berf llung des arbeitsmarktes infolge einer zu gro en zahl von arbeiterfamilien umgekehrt kann wenn das angebot an arbeitskr ften zu stark ist auch der sozialismus eine niedrige entlohnung nicht verhindern im brigen wird wenn das genossenschaftswesen sich allgemeiner ausbreitet kein wettbewerb unter arbeitern bestehen und die konkurrenz zwischen den genossenschaften w rde zugunsten der verbraucher d h zugunsten der genossenschaften und der erwerbst tigen klassen berhaupt wirken
5896827 der schutz gegen konkurrenz ist ein schutz der faulheit und der geistigen tr gheit
5896828 die arbeitenden klassen werden noch weniger als heute gewillt sein sich nur von dem ansehen und dem u eren schein der vornehmeren klassen auf den von ihnen einzuschlagenden wegen leiten und f hren zu lassen wenn sie schon jetzt keine ehrerbietige scheu und religi sen gehorsam besitzen die sie in geistiger h rigkeit gegen ber einer ber ihnen stehenden klasse festhalten k nnten so werden sie sie in zukunft weniger haben die schutz und abh ngigkeitstheorie wird ihnen mehr und mehr unertr glich sein und sie werden fordern dass ihr verhalten und ihre lebensbedingungen im wesentlichen von ihnen selbst bestimmt werden es ist gleichzeitig wohl m glich dass sie in manchen f llen die einmischung der gesetzgebung in ihre angelegenheiten und die gesetzliche regelung verschiedener sie betreffender verh ltnisse fordern wobei sie dann oft ihr selbstinteresse falsch verstehen werden
5896829 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5896830 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5896831 its not like we would ever who would you get thats better i mean with chucky so much of it and david and i talk about this a lot that because hes a puppet theres an aspect of him that feels like hes an animated character so his voice is such an immense part of it as well as what he looks like its almost like recasting homer simpson or something if you could recast it you would want the actor to sound kind of like it but it would feel weird to just be completely different i think

5896870 in april it was reported that the fbi had been focusing on as many as four suspects
5896871 confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
5896872 i was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described the tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years this is not spin this is not true
5896873 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
5896874 scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to congress and the media
5896875 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
5896876 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators

5896881 we make it difficult by expecting too much of ourselves no matter how good we are we expect to be better
5896882 they are not shifting the hips into the hitting position and they dont extend the clubhead through the line of direction to the target this is the fault of 90 percent of golfers
5896883 they all swung well but they could never get the club head hear the ball

5896915 one great thing about hockey is that youre able to display aggressive behavior in an acceptable manner you dont have to go to prison or whatnot for striking someone with an elbow it makes a good setting to look at aggression
5896916 we were astounded to see that this relatively simple measurement in the face predicted how aggressive men were in a lab based computer game and then equally astounded to see that the same measure could predict aggressive behavior in a real world setting that of sports
5896917 competitors may have used this cue likely on a subconscious level to decide whether or not to take an opponent on
5896918 for example if people were asked to rate how aggressive men were was on the basis of photographs would their ratings be accurate
5896919 these are the types of follow up research questions that we are now investigating
5896920 perhaps what the authors have documented is not an effect of masculine facial qualities and effects of testosterone but rather behavioral compensation for the social effects of babyfaceness
5896921 surprisingly i have found that their behavior is opposite to these expectations something that could be attributed to a self defeating prophecy effect whereby babyfaced men overcompensate for social expectations that are unpleasant for young men
5896922 despite widespread acknowledgement that obesity is endangering the health of millions of americans the country is still failing to respond clearly or comprehensively
5896923 we must work together governments schools and communities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity for all ages we must ensure that strong policies are implemented and enforced in every state not only to help reverse existing obesity rates but to prevent obesity among our nations children and generations to come
5896924 americas future depends on the health of our country the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs our analysis shows that we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the urgency it deserves
5896925 even though communities have started taking action considering the scope of the problem the countrys response has been severely limited for significant change to happen combating obesity must become a national priority
5896926 we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers
5896927 we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features
5896928 but to genuine social experience as strategies from british born chinese are rather western like
5896929 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms
5896930 caution should be taken when generalizing findings to the entire human population
5896931 into why non verbal interpersonal communication between people from different cultures is sometimes problematic as gaze in direct face to face interactions might land in disjointed locations

5896958 batman he does justice sometimes against insurmountable odds and he doesnt make his good works known to a lot of people so a lot of people think hes just a rich playboy

5896973 as member of the judiciary committee we are writing laws that affect the hip hop community i want to extend the hands of friendship on behalf of the united states congress and the congressional black caucus
5896974 clearly they have to encourage first for people to be registered i would like to see and be involved in a major voter registration campaign i know senator obama is doing one but lets do one on top of his if you miss the deadline you cannot go in november and vote
5896975 what i think the hip hop community can do is record how many people they registered to vote and how many people they had that put obama and other elected officials over the top they can be a power horse in this election
5896976 the votes make a difference in peoples lives voters who stayed home in 2000 and 2004 might have put a different us attorney in gena louisiana that might have prevented mychal bell from going to jail the vote might not be seen today but it will be seen when you need it with civil rights laws better judges and people who have an understanding of the judiciary system
5896977 we are not provoking native communities but safeguarding areas that are of strategic importance for the country
5896978 the government has declared open war on indigenous people and the demonstrators will stay there until the problem is solved they prefer to die there they arent afraid
5896979 they are being stage managed by a group of lawyers who are deliberately misinforming them
5896980 we want to provide a solution to the fair demands of these communities because the government continues to act arrogantly without any ability to dialogue
5896981 the underlying problem is that the government is attempting to portray indigenous people as just another group of poor people without admitting that they have a different way of life a different cultural viewpoint
5896982 the authorities think they can calm the demands of indigenous people by building schools or medical clinics but the pending debt to the indigenous population is much more complex than that
5896983 they should not be seen as inferior because of their attempt to block the influx of private investment into their territories
5896984 the problem is that peru has a hard time seeing cultural differences as something positive as part of the countrys wealth peruvian society sees them instead as an obstacle
5896985 some non governmental organisations that are active in these issues are inciting people to do these kinds of things which in the end are subversive activities because they are undermining the foundations of democracy
5896986 how have they achieved the miracle of being able to bring together in one place at the same time communities so widely dispersed as the jungle peoples that will have to be investigated
5896987 peru which in past decades in the 1970s was in the vanguard with respect to indigenous issues is now in last place on the list
5896988 these protests might end in dialogue but the problem will continue because there are no government policies that value and respect indigenous people
5896989 such testimony and mancusos explosive political revelations were aborted near midnight on may 12 when without warning mr uribe had the auc commander and 13 high level colleagues plucked from detention on the outskirts of medellin and extradited to the us
5896990 the initiative to amend the constitution was flawed by criminal acts
5896991 summing up the aims of the new regime villarroel uttered his most memorable refrain we are not enemies of the rich but we are better friends of the poor this impossible pledge to favor the poor without estranging the rich couched in a language of intimate ties encapsulates the military populists ambitious but doomed reformism
5896992 triumph of the democratic and cultural revolution of the bolivian people we dedicate this to all the revolutionaries of latin america and the world
5896993 what the bolivian people expressed today with their vote is their support for this process of change therefore i want to say to the bolivian people with much respect that we are here to continue advancing the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization and the recovery of our state enterprises
5896994 but i also want to say brothers and sisters we are convinced that it is important to unite bolivians and the participation of the bolivian people works to unite the different sectors of the countryside and the city the east and the west and that unity will be brought together in the new political constitution of the bolivian state with the autonomous statutes
5896995 the groups that dominated bolivia for decades and that still maintain the major part of economic and media power are the same groups that subjugate to poverty underdevelopment and racial discrimination the vast majority of the population
5896996 three million bolivians have felt obliged to search for the minimal conditions for their survival in other countries this tendency will only be reversed when the economic structure of the nation can recuperate from the injustice inequality and exclusion it has suffered until now
5896997 to support the revolutionary and democratic process that the bolivian people and the government of evo morales are pushing forward
5896998 to the subversive separatists a halo of legality they did not possess earlier
5896999 this insensible totalitarian masista incapable government has neglected the development of the people and only seeks to concentrate power and transform us into beggars before it
5897000 the counterrevolution has conquered liberated zones in which the central government cant enter
5897001 the present political conjuncture in bolivia is indeed contradictory in principle regional self determination and the peoples right to immediately recall their elected officials are pillars of democracy but in todays bolivia regional autonomy means handing over the countrys wealth lock stock and barrel to the most reactionary sectors of the bolivian ruling class and to continued exploitation by the transnational corporations
5897002 public investment has increased significantly over the past two years rising from 629 million in 2005 to 1 103 million in 2007 most of the new funds have been spent on roads and other infrastructure totaling close to 60 percent of total investments in 2007 social investment has decreased over this period to less than 30 percent of total investments in 2007
5897003 in the conventional or historical sense via expropriation or changes in property regimes
5897004 the bolivian workers central loyal to its glorious history of revolutionary struggle will never be a political instrument of the oligarchy and imperialism our iron commitment is with the defense of the democratic political process opened up in the heroic days of october 2004 sic 2003 and may june 2005 with the blood of the bolivian people and workers we are convinced that the revolutionary patriotic and popular forces have to unite in a single front to crush the oligarchy and imperialism but not at the cost of giving up our social rights that have been curtailed by neoliberalism much less of getting caught up in the political games pongueaje politico of this or any other government

5897044 how many iep meetings does it take to change a light bulb
5897045 the light bulb is not the only thing thats burnt out
5897046 no one said i was going to have to teach changing light bulbs
5897047 if you hadnt wanted so many hours of service in that room maybe the light bulb wouldnt have burned out
5897048 we dont need a light bulb its not like theyre reading or writing
5897049 well have to just keep changing his placement until we find a room that has a light bulb
5897050 the side benefit is that well have to bring them up from the basement
5897051 we dont really need a new light bulb theres enough light coming off the television
5897052 is there supposed to be a light in the time out room
5897053 first we have to determine that the light bulbs really burnt out and then we can trial a flashlight
5897054 i dont know how many it will take to change the light bulb but all the special ed children will have to go home until we do
5897055 o k then how many minutes of light are we allotting in the iep
5897056 we are willing to provide nightlights and maybe open the door a crack we feel this is more than educationally appropriate and all rowley requires
5897057 i dont understand why youre being so difficult its not like were asking for a chandelier

5897074 which person is going to show up to the office today
5897075 waitrose is investing over 10 million in product development each year we do not outsource our product development to suppliers like other supermarkets rather we employ top master chefs to create new waitrose branded product lines because of our business model our produce buyers are more tenured and experienced so they understand the product categories better this has allowed us to shift from organic to new segments such as locally grown fresh produce which grew 170 last year faster than our competitors weve also invested in online supermarket ocado acquiring a 25 stake in the company thats helping waitrose expand coverage into new geographic regions and gain a 16 share in online food retailing in the uk
5897076 at a time when the state of new jersey needs to support economic development projects around the state the response from trenton has been to pass a law that hobbles new projects with an affordable housing tax
5897077 thanks to the coah legislation the state is adding 5 million to the price tag of a stadium that media reports indicate will cost over 200 million
5897078 whether its the new jersey motorsports park in millville or the building of this long awaited soccer stadium desperately needed regional economic development projects that create jobs need a helping hand from the legislature not a kick in the shins
5897079 piling new taxes on the red bull park project only serves to undermine the 39 4 million in taxpayer financed bonds that have already been invested to acquire the stadium site these bonds are secured by future in lieu of tax payments from the stadium and the larger harrison metrocentre public private development project instead of talking about urban redevelopment and smart growth projects maybe the politicians in trenton should stop taxing them

5897240 it is perhaps inevitable that we are inclined to always be judging others but let me share this observation i am not superior to the people on my show and you are not superior to the people you will represent that is not an insult it is merely an understanding derived from a life spent on the front lines of human interaction we are all alike some of us just dress better or have more money or perhaps we were born into better circumstances of parental upbringing health brains and luck

5897275 it reflects on michaels relationship with his colleagues in the community
5897276 i remember mike walking to work or home from work and seeing me in one of my fire department shirts and asking me how to join the fire department
5897277 he was so outgoing we all loved being part of the fire department and helping people
5897278 we prayed for him we went to see him at the hospital
5897279 around the firehouse hed cook for us and hed help with anything
5897280 he was so well versed on anything from history to science fiction he wasnt big into dress blues or flowers which is why his wife chose to send him off in civilian attire but just the manpower that showed up today hed appreciate
5897281 i think hed appreciate the love and respect that was shown today
5897282 the back was fully involved and flames were shooting out the front when we got here
5897283 using a 3 000 degree acetylene torch in a wood frame building is like using matches in a barn full of hay wood and flames do not mix

5897285 my eyes werent lying to me when i saw how fast that erupted how fast that spread
5897286 i saw the lack of retardant without the firewalls and it doesnt take a lot of brains to realize there could have been something done better or differently

5897294 losing parties pay the costs of the winner which can include travel costs depositions telephone calls and copies but not the attorneys fees of the side unless there is a statue requiring that fee shifting occur
5897295 there are a number of such statues but few require a losing plaintiff to pay the winning defendants fees only a losing defendant fee shifting statues typically exist in areas in which a state legislature or the u s congress has tried to encourage plaintiffs to file meritorious lawsuits an example would be employment discrimination litigation

5897298 let me be very clear that the government has made absolutely no statement indicating that vaccines are a cause of autism
5897299 that is a complete mischaracterization of the findings of the case and a complete mischaracterization of any of the science that we have at our disposal today
5897300 the internal revenue service today issued its 2008 list of the 12 most egregious tax schemes and scams highlighted by internet phishing scams and several frivolous tax arguments
5897301 lord evermore thy face we seek tempted we are and poor and weak keep us with lowly hearts and meek let us not fall let us not fall
5897302 there is nothing in the world so much like prayer as music is
5897303 the study supports the decision by the world health organization to continue to permit thimerosal to remain in vaccines for the worlds children
5897304 a television show that perpetuates the myth that vaccines cause autism is the height of reckless irresponsibility on the part of abc and its parent company the walt disney co
5897305 if parents watch this program and choose to deny their children immunizations abc will share in the responsibility for the suffering and deaths that occur as a result the consequences of a decline in immunization rates could be devastating to the health of our nations children
5897306 current open source projects are a step in the right direction but do not address fully the total rethinking of library management systems needed by academic libraries
5897307 im certainly a strong supporter of him i have endorsed him im a democrat im going up to spend two days in ohio campaigning for him
5897308 i think as a lot of his friends think im certainly not the only one saying that hes got some connecting to do across this gap that exists and i hope he will step up to that and do it
5897309 being from the other side of the mason dixon line i certainly have found over the years that ive started out facing a lot of people like in rural tennessee across kind of a chasm
5897310 libertarians hate the government and love a good fight they are absolutely the best friends you can have
5897311 you have to understand the anatomy of whats going on in the game
5897312 cc has thrown an average of 13 7 pitches per inning which is the seventh lowest in baseball where guys get in trouble is the 20 25 and 30 pitch innings cc has none of those we set up the rotation for cc and benny to have those types of night
5897313 you give them the opportunity when the situation allows it its a certain mental pride knowing they can go out in a major league game and finish what they start
5897314 i felt like he deserved the opportunity no matter what the score was last night for him to accomplish it and it was something that he wanted to accomplish
5897315 the last inning if we made a play for him it would have been under 10 pitches
5897316 never once did he labor where he labored was the chicago game july 28 when he threw 6 2 3 innings and had 124 pitches thats grinding through those are the starts that wear on you not the starts like yesterday
5897317 i respect him as a player i respect him as a person and hes got a family i know how this business works and he has to provide for his family and i would never do anything to take away from that ability i just couldnt live with myself thats just not the type of person i am
5897318 will be sending 12 000 to 15 000 additional u s troops to afghanistan possibly as soon as the end of this year with planning underway for a further force buildup in 2009
5897319 some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
5897320 report 69 percent of foreign policy experts favor redeployment from iraq
5897321 im told its better than when he first got here
5897322 weve talked to aaron and that wasnt a good idea
5897323 if hes able to pitch well the last month it would give him some success to build on if he shut it down itd leave a bad taste in his mouth all winter
5897324 if you look at the mechanics of his swing and ive looked at it hes in the zone so long
5897325 obviously i dont know what exactly his height and weight are but he definitely has a lot of power he has a fundamentally sound swing and thats why you see him do well hes an aggressive hitter and he attacks the zone
5897326 you see guys on top of the plate like that and all of a sudden people think they can get by him his bat speed is one of the best ive seen in a little while and thats how he creates so much power
5897327 every time we put him in the second spot he doesnt do well
5897328 down there we need some help if the big boys dont do it we have him to back them up and do some damage and lately hes done that thats why we dont think about moving him up at all
5897329 this kid you see in spring training in tucson how good he is because the ball is flying all over the place
5897330 but we go back and see him take batting practice and we know hes got some pop
5897331 i was kind of worried about how hes going to make adjustments in the united states but he doesnt know the pitchers or who is throwing and doesnt care i think that helps him
5897332 most of the time when you say oh god we face josh beckett in two weeks i guarantee you a lot of people dont sleep you got me
5897333 ramirez doesnt care how hard he throws he just goes out there and swings the bat
5897334 fifty thousand is great five years of season tickets is amazing
5897335 they actually asked me to see my ticket again and my buddy bought my ticket so i was like i dont know whats wrong with this ticket but its an amazing feeling
5897336 one guy was talking about how much youd get after taxes my other buddy ben i was about to switch spots with him in line so i was completely kidding around until they put that big fat check right here
5897337 i called my mom talked to her for a few minutes she was pretty excited didnt believe me i had to tell her about seven times
5897338 ive always dreamed of having season tickets theyd be great to have but obviously im not in the financial spot to have it up until today apparently so thats great
5897339 obviously baseball has been a very big part of this city and this community for a long time its withstood the test of time that in itself is an accomplishment that speaks for itself
5897340 every day its somebody different henry blanco reed johnson jim edmonds derrek lee or aramis ramirez weve been getting clutch hitting from everybody
5897341 it seems like pitching starters and the bullpen guys have been coming up from the minor leagues and doing well weve been blessed with a lot of hard working guys and were all looking in the same direction
5897342 just to be mentioned like that is really flattering im honored
5897343 there are a lot of guys with big numbers and big names out there just the thought that they even think of me it makes me think ive won it already but i dont really pay a lot of attention to that right now win games and see where were at at the end of september
5897344 thats how you win you win with good athletes and guys that can play
5897345 it really comes down to 25 guys and a few guys up and down from the minor leagues to help you out you cant win without that
5897346 as much as i want to see it i have a responsibility to my team and the guys on the field ill see what i can
5897347 im going to cry regardless of what happens this has been a long four years
5897348 i know how much misty has put into this mission of what shes got going right now regardless of what happens there is kind of that relief feeling when its over
5897349 its a reminder to her that shes not out there by herself
5897350 ive done just about everything now during a rain delay
5897351 she has some obligations that shes going to have to meet but thats definitely in the plans to have children and raise some kids
5897352 it will be nice to see my wife again and hopefully spend some time with her before the season is over
5897353 we played together a bit ive watched a few of the baseball games hes a smart player hes been around for a long time he was in the cardinals organization and hes had some big league time
5897354 especially in the middle of a pennant race every run matters every out matters so i want to apologize for it its just something that cant happen
5897355 youve got a guy who in my opinion is going to be different
5897356 im going to put my butt on the line by saying that im going to do everything possible and i think everybody in here is going to do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands anymore its not in anybody elses hands but ours as players
5897357 i dont think people should be quick to judge b j
5897358 so what theres been a couple of incidents that obviously shouldnt have happened
5897359 he knows it i know it and like i said yesterday no one feels worse than him when things like that happen
5897360 and its how these things should be handled i really want to move beyond all this the focus needs to be on how well we are playing and the accomplishments of these guys in mondays game
5897361 the last thing i want to become is a distraction to this team
5897362 weve got something way too good going on right now to have to deal with this i think we just want to win ballgames and right now i think im becoming a distraction so i just cant let it happen for my sake and for the teams sake so we can move on and get to where we need to be
5897363 i feel like i go out and play hard every day i want to win as much as anybody in this room once again things like that cant happen it just so happens theyre magnified a little bit more now than they have been in the past so its something ive got to deal with and not let it happen again

5897370 i like to have fun as long as they know they wont get hurt i just let them do what they do as long as they respect each other and as long as they dont get mad when it happens then its a different thing

5897375 they are together but theres enough separation there that i think you have to do whats best for adam and our club right now and then get carp back as soon as we can then well see where we are
5897376 as a starter you have a workout routine that you do on certain days
5897377 not knowing whether youre a reliever or a starter you dont know how to work out or to run
5897378 i feel like my identity is as a starter but im not throwing out the other option
5897379 hell face the lefty manny parra tomorrow and he has thursday off to get refreshed
5897380 this lets me use all my left handers and then give him rest
5897381 thats ok he wants to play and thats good im just looking out for him
5897382 i was just going out there and having fun and enjoying the game of baseball
5897383 it was just one of those things where i just got hot and ive stayed with it
5897384 just being in the situation the first couple of months up and down that was a different situation for me
5897385 that was the first time i had ever been experience anything i just had to get back to what i know and that was just having fun and not worrying about what was going to happen up here
5897386 we would use him in an emergency if we had to its a deep bruise delmon is not moving around very well today its more of a jam theres not a lot of swelling well probably refrain from using him unless there was an emergency also
5897387 i expected it to be an infielder i knew it wasnt going to be an outfielder or a pitcher or a catcher it had to be an infielder that would get hit in the hand
5897388 everett is probably going to miss tuesday and wednesday available as he told me in a pinch if we need him
5897389 i dont know about delmon he is limping around pretty good on his foot but he says he can play which is good
5897390 everything is the same i feel good with my arm
5897391 the last two or three weeks like that im throwing bad
5897392 i like to pitch a lot but right now for me its like bad luck
5897393 he expects a lot out of himself sometimes you go through those periods where you try to do more than youre capable of
5897394 we know thats the nature of baseball you go through periods like that every pitcher goes through it its a matter of bouncing back were at a point where we need to use all of our bullpen we cant just ride a few guys for the rest of the year when were in a situation where weve got to rest somebody somebody else has got to step up
5897395 if we were to look at this month compared with the rest of the season im probably on pace for another 30 strikeout month
5897396 definitely not any more comfortable than i have been in the past
5897397 this whole season has been a learning experience for me ive been really good and ive been really bad ive got to narrow the gaps between the really good and really bad
5897398 its making the pitches at the right time i might be around the plate too much theres a fine line between being aggressive and making smart pitches ive got to find that
5897399 but i swear everyone is going to get better for it were going out there and busting our butts every day
5897400 the talk he had with us was to enjoy baseball and to enjoy life dont get upset about slumps dont get upset about winning or losing and to just remember how lucky we are
5897401 john had every reason to complain about his situation but he chose not to
5897402 what he did do was show unfathomable courage and great wisdom for someone so young johns body could not win the battle with cancer but johns tremendous spirit will live on amongst all those he and his story impacted across the country
5897403 i knew that the chances werent real good that he would be around for it but i was hoping he would make it
5897404 it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be you sit back and you look at a guy like that who knows his days are numbered and never got to play in the big leagues and got one high school at bat and was still loving life he was special to me
5897405 what he brought the team for the day he was with us the courage that he showed the message that he had just the message that he sent and the number of lives that he touched was phenomenal
5897406 i think if he was here today he would say dont fret he was a great inspiration to everyone
5897407 im still kind of dealing with the fact that this is an issue again you think its over and done with when you get surgery to fix something especially when everything felt so great for more than a year from the time i got it fixed
5897408 but for now im just hoping the as athletic trainers are right and its just a little inflammation that we can shoot up and work through
5897409 last year it built slowly it was there then it would kind of die down then it was there and back and forth like that until it got really bad and we had to shut it down
5897410 this time it was just there one day in my last start aug 13 and i pitched through it but then it just got so bad monday that i just couldnt pitch anymore this time it all happened a lot faster
5897411 i want to prove i can pitch a whole season

5897414 i cant predict whats going to happen in four weeks
5897415 i dont need to see him i know who he is and what he is and how hes thrown what kind of guy he is and what kind of stuff hes got this is a tremendous credit to chris ray and what hes done and how hard hes worked to get himself where hes at he doesnt have to prove anything to me
5897416 the decision on what direction that will go will be determined on how he progresses in this program
5897417 thatll be something that president of baseball operations andy macphail chris ray and our medical staff will come to grips with
5897418 hes going to play catch hell hit off a tee hes off the crutches and he was on the bike yesterday
5897419 i think hell get cleared by dr campbell the foot specialist and when he does well increase his baseball activity i wouldnt be surprised if by the end of the week hes out there with first base coach john shelby taking fly balls and ground balls and maybe in the batting practice group

5897449 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5897450 el stitch y bitch will meet once again this wednesday aug
5897451 clearly its heavy on someone elses mind via silly blogs notes status messages that people have filled me in on daily
5897452 this is so beneath me that i have chosen to let this person go
5897453 i am about to cover i think all listed below pretty much covers my response to a rather silly blog posted of course only after i was deleted from friends lists once again how old are we lmao this is too funny
5897454 personally i feel a woman is someone who can respect herself carry herself with respect keeps her private business private doesnt go broadcasting her behind closed doors life around like a 15 year old high school student looking for attention she knows that all woman may do their thing but a grown woman is gonna keep her business behind closed doors
5897455 a woman can walk away from an unhealthy relationship without making it some sort of dramatic spectacle whether it be romantic business or just a friendship whatever happened happened between herself and who she has let go of and nobody else she doesnt feel the need to carry on or even entertain discussions because she is grown and already made her decision a woman knows when its time to let go and doesnt look back despite that persons desperate attempts at getting some type of response
5897456 she values real friendships and doesnt entertain anything less just for attention sake when someone tries to cross her friends she holds them down because they would do the same and when they dont shes adult enough to realize they are not true friends she doesnt use people for her personal gain talk trash about them then act like their best friend when she needs something especially not her own family
5897457 a woman knows when shes f ed up and she owns up to it she doesnt try and flip the script with manipulative rhetoric she also doesnt make abrupt decisions so trust that if she makes a bold or unexpected move one day she has been onto you for sometime now to come to that decision
5897458 a woman knows who her enemies are and is smart enough to keep them in her back pocket until their actions have spoken so loudly that they have played themselves out
5897459 a woman knows that anyone who truly respects her will respect her mind over her body and accept one with the other
5897460 a woman has heart enough to give friends the benefit of the doubt even when everyone she knows secretly tells her that person may not be worth it or is a bad look she comes to her own conclusions and if those others were right she is grown enough to soak it all up and let it go a woman doesnt go back and forth over her decisions doesnt have time or tolerance for bullshit excuses and tactics she is a boss and just like in any job shes kept a watchful eye on you and when she finally lets you go she lets you go dont try and debate it but then again a grown adult would bow out gracefully
5897461 a woman knows that those who matter wont make her feel bad for having a life and priorities
5897462 ive always found that how much some1 cares about u is directly proportionate to how much u can piss them off as it were
5897463 im so clueless i dont know what i did wrong
5897464 there was a man on our roof with a gun
5897465 i would like to do or have this but i cant because
5897466 people are always blaming circumstance for what they are i do not believe in circumstance the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstance they want and if they cant find them they make them
5897467 isnt liked at high school and doesnt do well in that environment
5897468 doug why dont you check over your work to see if its correct
5897469 why teacher i know its right isnt that your job i mean you have the book with all the answers right there
5897470 i looked into those eyes and what i saw there in that long ago moment i can never forget it was as if we had known each other for a lifetime knew all and understood all we were complete there was nothing more to do or say without hesitation i surrendered to the truth of that indescribable moment i have never been the same since
5897471 i dont think the world will be ready for this album
5897472 it is in gods plan thats the way it happens that kind of stuff happens when you play hard so i cant sit here and dwell on that
5897473 you know ill be giving my teammates support same deal as last year
5897474 im here to support my guys have fun and see where we go
5897475 there may be some ground rules this time as to where he can go and cant go in the dugout
5897476 its always nice to have him around i think he gives us more than a guy on the disabled list would whether its moral support and keeping it loose and so forth or the little extra incentive and drive to go out there and try to win because of a guy like that going down knowing that everybody has to pick it up a little bit and knowing what he means to this team
5897477 we conserve the environment we are not ignorant we are prepared we know that foreigners want to buy our amazon lands because they know they are the worlds lungs we will not allow this we will die fighting for our rights
5897478 microsoft flight simulator 2004 cant run under a remote desktop session and will now quit

5897480 having people who are close to the leadership of campaigns can give important insights to where the country might be in three to five years
5897481 thats positive however when the board meets they ensure that strategies are in place to create value i have never personally witnessed a substantive political discussion
5897482 ive seen republican board members push environmental education and medical issues ive seen democrats on boards who will pursue whats best for the company from a tax standpoint
5897483 they had a lot of respect for romney and some contributed to his campaign when he ran for president

5897492 it was fantastic to meet up with the two men on junk
5897493 we are like minded on the subject of pollution of the oceans and we had lots to talk about
5897494 i was desperately needing to meet up with somebody who could give me a re supply of water and no other vessel had been near enough
5897495 it was so good to have the water the weather is so hot and humid now that they might quite literally have saved my life
5897496 it was extremely exciting to see another human being in the middle of the ocean
5897497 we were missing seeing another face so that was wonderful
5897498 she needed water and we needed food it was a feeling of reciprocal altruism that is very basic to human nature this experience was one of the highlights of my life
5897499 the most ubiquitous trash out here is plastic and the most common i would say are fragments of plastic bags and water bottles

5897509 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down li said
5897510 it shows the dream of chinese sportsmen for generations and also the common aspirations of 1 3 billion chinese people
5897511 otaku the nickname given to the chinese couch potatoes glued to olympic tv coverage
5897512 more and more young people are participating in olympic sports said dr
5897513 and were seeing people crowd around big screen tvs to watch the events theyre more interested in sports than in cultural programs
5897514 this is the culmination of a 100 year dream to have an olympic games in china the olympics have had a feel good effect on chinese society which they probably will elect to keep up
5897515 with the sports infrastructure the facilities the coaches who are being developed here and the young people who will be inspired by these games we think this will be a formidable system that well have to contend with for a very very long time said jim scherr head of the u
5897516 in shooting we call it the home venue curse said wang yifu coach of chinas shooting team

5897518 there is so much psychological pressure on them that i thought more athletes might collapse she said
5897519 i have a responsibility to fight for my country i was fighting for chinas glory
5897520 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system

5897525 the worst is yet to come in the u s
5897526 the degree and depth of whats happening in the financial industry is beyond anything weve seen in decades and it takes time to get your arms around the severity of whats happening and what the long term and short term ramifications are
5897527 the united states so called war on drugs brings to mind the old saying that if you find yourself trapped in a deep hole stop digging yet last week the senate approved an aid package to combat drug trafficking in mexico and central america with a record 400 million going to mexico and 65 million to central america the united states has been spending 69 billion a year worldwide for the last 40 years for a total of 2 5 trillion on drug prohibition with little to show for it is anyone actually benefiting from this war six groups come to mind
5897528 for almost forty years america has been engaged in a war which has cost us trillions of dollars and ruined the lives of millions of our citizens we have been fighting against drugs in a street war across the country the definition enemy combatant has changed through the course of this conflict first encompassing only the smugglers and distributors then growing to include users and now reaching beyond our borders to the farmers in the developing world who produce the source crops today we are told that all these parties are contributing to the forces of terror and that the whole chain of enemy forces is complicit in a conspiracy against us if this were true though wouldnt we disarm our enemies by taking control of the economic forces that are the source of their power
5897529 just yesterday this is not anything that hasnt happened before but it just continued to happen just yesterday we learned that owners of land will not be able to develop it in montana because of a grouse a grouse population the ultimate aim is to get the grouse put on the endangered species list so the owners of that property cant do diddly squat with it theres oil underneath that land and theres an opportunity for developers to make residential areas out of it or what have you so there are people active in this country doing everything they can to destroy the countrys ability to grow to remain prosperous and to remain a superpower

5897541 it is rumored that i come in at night and engrave my initials on every nail head of my projects but its not true i am up thumbing through out of print architecture books or reading about our legendary women of style elsie de wolfe slim keith babe paley i draw inspiration from the armchairs they are reclining on in their country homes my eye travels to the crystal girandoles on the mantel they are leaning against or the moss covered garden statuary their horse is riding past
5897542 i like to create libraries where men with names like howard bing and spencer sat in cashmere sweaters and contemplated the 13th hole on the bel air golf course i am drawn to a simple but elegant time when the women were so legendary that surnames werent necessary slim babe coco

5897547 as neither kittery nor wells ogunquit is in an approved configuration i believe there is an opportunity for the two school systems to explore combining central offices sharing resources and administering functions such as special education transportation facilities and maintenance from a single office through an rsu regional school unit or an aos alternative organizational structure
5897548 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together
5897549 i have a real issue with this because the commissioner is forcing this on us and it wont save any money
5897550 i cant see spending anymore time on this its not helping education its hurting it
5897551 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
5897552 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
5897553 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
5897554 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has
5897555 if the focus is on the money side it should have been kept on the money side
5897556 wells size allows them to be their own rsu or to be exempt from the consolidation requirement
5897557 im concerned that two weeks after the wells ogunquit combination falls through well get this same letter with another districts name in it
5897558 i didnt have any empirical evidence of the quality of the restaurants other than my own impressions
5897559 i wanted to see what the standards of the awards of excellence were the results speak for themselves
5897560 i hope you dont have too much indigestion after eating your words
5897561 to come to grips with the fact that he was simply a person with a video camera who happened to record some public events
5897562 but it feels like its much harder for them to make their point now that its how i earn my paycheck
5897563 but i think its understood youre trying to get the facts of the story a reader can easily understand and no story is free of minute details that are also important
5897564 first block of embarcadero six windows were reported broken at 10 59 a
5897565 we didnt see journalist in that description and that made us wonder were we getting behind a guy who was not there to gather news but who was involved in the protests
5897566 i cant speak for josh but there was this thinking going around at the time oh man down with the mainstream media yet it was the mainstream who was right there to help josh out
5897567 there are very few easy poster children for good causes of journalism
5897568 its less important for people to debate who is a journalist and more important for people to consider is it journalism
5897569 if his only journalistic quality is that he runs around with a camera and films stuff then a whole lot of teenagers can be considered journalists

5897571 the kamikaze could be practically anybody american nationalists american communists american fundamentalist christians american anarchists anybody who rejects the twin gods of the dollar and the m 16 who hates the stock market and interventions overseas who dreams of america for americans who does not want to support the drive for world domination they could be native americans returning to manhattan or afro americans who still have not received compensation for slavery they could be foreigners of practically any extraction as wall street and the pentagon ruined many lives of people all over the globe germans can remember the fiery holocaust of dresden with its hundreds of thousands of peaceful refugees incinerated by the us air force the japanese will not forget the nuclear holocaust of hiroshima the arab world still feels the creeping holocaust of iraq and palestine russians and east europeans feel the shame of belgrade latin americans think of american invasions of panama and granada of destroyed nicaragua and defoliated colombia asians count their dead of vietnam war cambodia bombings laos cia operations in millions even a pro american russian tv broadcaster could not refrain from saying now americans begin to understand the feelings of baghdad and belgrade the riders could be anybody who lost his house to the bank who was squeezed from his work and made permanently unemployed who was declared an untermench by the new herrenvolk they could be russians malaysians mexicans indonesians pakistanis congolese brazilians vietnamese as their economy was destroyed by wall street and the pentagon they could be anybody and they are everybody their identity is quite irrelevant as their message is more important than their personalities and their message is read loud and clear in the choice of targets
5897572 i cant accept the mossad and or the jews as the perpetrators of the 9 11 not because it is an antisemitic claim
5897573 if it was done and it did not flop its got to be jews
5897574 if it did not flop it cant be the mossad
5897575 i have waited 30 years i can wait 30 more to leave with my dignity

5897577 this is a fundamental question as to where al jazeera stands does it stand with the extremists or is it a professional media organisation

5897582 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organization with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
5897583 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organization including having ties with israel
5897584 we see this as another trumped up charge against the bahais in order for the government to go through the motions of setting them up on charges and convicting them on charges
5897585 they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organisation including having ties with israel
5897586 suggestions of collusion with the state of israel are categorically false and misleading the iranian authorities are playing on the fact that the bahai world administrative centre is located in northern israel
5897587 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organization with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
5897588 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organization including having ties with israel
5897589 seven detained bahai believers have confessed to setting up an illegal organization in iran that took orders from israel
5897590 over the next thirty five years the nation would remain obsessed with the kennedy assassination hundreds of books would be written full of feverish speculation about oswald and ruby and their possible links to organized crime or soviet intelligence in five years of reporting for this book i found nothing that would change the instinctive conclusions of julius draznin or the much more detailed findings of the warren commission oswald and ruby acted alone
5897591 owed its success not just to the failings of the cia but to the weakness of the fbi and the bureaus chronic inability to synthesize intelligence reports draw conclusions and work with other agencies
5897592 the cia of 2001 was not up to the job since the breakup of the soviet union a decade earlier the cia had become increasingly bureaucratic and unwilling to take risks and had promoted officers who shared such values it had steadily reduced its reliance on overseas human intelligence and cut the number of case officers abroad

5897600 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
5897601 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
5897602 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

5897604 modern political history indicates a clear connection between being jewish and being radical both as individual theorists and activists of the stature of marx luxemburg trotsky and emma goldman and as organized mass labour movements in for example revolutionary russia and early 20th century britain and the usa jews have made a disproportionate contribution to the left
5897605 there the great world progressive features of jewish culture stand clearly revealed its internationalism its identification with the advanced movements of the epoch the percentage of jews in the democratic and proletarian movements is everywhere higher than the percentage of jews among the population
5897606 in many countries in russia and rumania for instance but above all in hungary and in poland the leadership of the working class parties the russian social revolutionary party excepted is almost exclusively in the hands or jews as is plainly apparent from an extermination of the personality of the delegates to the international congresses

5897612 in 1945 many poles felt and not without reason that jews ran the office of state security the chief of the office was jacob berman a jew and all or almost all the department heads were jews
5897613 a disproportionate number of communists were jews in 1930 at its peak 35 of the members of the party were jewish in communist youth organizations jewish membership was even higher while communists of jewish origin occupied most of the seats on the central committee communism appealed to some jews because it opposed anti semitism more vigorously than any other polish party jewish communists reached their apogee in the years immediately after world war two when the party leadership was totally in the hands of the prewar communist leadership that abhorred anti semitism
5897614 the average pole could not but notice in the stalinist era that the two most powerful men in the country berman and minc were both jewish as was the dreaded security official rozanski
5897615 considered by historians of soviet terror operations to have been the most fearsome soviet spy of all time

5897619 when i grew up i tried to ask but there werent really answers
5897620 during my theological studies at university it became clear that i couldnt be a minister in the church
5897621 i concluded that christianity was paganism one of its most important dogmas is that god became man and if god becomes man then man also can become god
5897622 well you see he is a father of course but ideologically there was no connection i was so involved in my conviction that i had found the right path all the other items no longer had any importance
5897623 for him that was the end of the world my son is leaving germany to study in a jewish rabbinical seminary he told me i was crazy and renounced me as a son
5897624 people there dont get married and if they do they have one child
5897625 but the turks and the other foreigners have many children so it is a question of time that germany will no longer be german
5897626 germany will leave the stage of history no doubt about it
5897627 all the great cultures have left the stage of history
5897628 the romans the greeks the egyptians the babylonians but this little people who gave so much to the world do not
5897629 the motive of the converts is to join the community of the victims if you become part of the victim community you get rid of the burden of being part of the perpetrator community
5897630 shear yashuv represents a person who ran away from the past
5897631 there were no jews in these stories and no nazis in these stories
5897632 no no there were no nazis we are not nazis we didnt know any jews we didnt know anything
5897633 people said now we have closed the circle now everything is fine
5897634 it was like nothing had happened but there were 11 000 jews in munich before the holocaust where are they now
5897635 because i was annoyed by how the narrative was fixed
5897636 there is something not right when you do it to get rid of your german burden
5897637 that is not honest in my eyes do you stop being the daughter of a wehrmacht soldier if you are jewish no that is no solution you dont get rid of it
5897638 to live here to work here to be this bridge between two worlds
5897639 that is another way of saying what i have already told you
5897640 they want to join the community of the victim they may have their own way of rationalizing it
5897641 i was always looking for my place i hated catholicism i have hated it since i was 14
5897642 what counts is the deed in christianity it is enough just to believe
5897643 i didnt think of my family of being like the germans
5897644 you went in the classroom twice a week they told you you fell asleep
5897645 she was 13 she says she remembered there were jewish shops that got burned down and it was a big loss because she said you could always go to the jews and buy something and if you didnt have the money you could bring it in next time
5897646 i feel myself turning into a block of ice every time when i go back i have to force myself to melt down again
5897647 but it is not the way to work through the role of the parents in the war i think it is running away from it in order to be able to really work through the past you have to try to understand how could it be that your father was a mass murderer you have to think of the possibilities that had you lived at this time you might also have been able to do such things
5897648 being in israel is to keep away as far as possible from it
5897649 i am not sure to what extent they have really been accepted into israeli society i think they are struggling i dont envy them
5897650 you are not here to speak to me you are here to speak to my girlfriend
5897651 i met some who surprised me some of them were shockingly unintelligent i even wondered why they would have the intellectual independence to make this choice especially the people who chose to be ultra orthodox who chose to throw away their freedom
5897652 i was worried i would get hurt by information i didnt want to know
5897653 sometimes i feel that a lot of israelis live that way it is better not to ask questions and not be hurt and so you dont have to look at yourself or your family or your nation and you can live with the illusion of who is good and who is bad
5897654 i heard a boy next door call another boy a stupid jew
5897655 i asked my mother what is a jew and is it something bad
5897656 i was physically disgusted and i was totally disgusted by even my own germanness
5897657 and because this entered my mind so early it became as natural as brushing my teeth
5897658 i felt that i was being told that to be a good jew you had to hate arabs
5897659 it causes a lot of tension to come here and say the things that i say
5897660 because it would be very inconsistent to have had so much criticism of germans who were terrible cowards when it was still possible to say something and then to come here and not speak up for justice
5897661 dont think i havent thought about it in those terms myself
5897662 i had wanted to connect myself to a history i did not perceive as shameful now i am wondering if i will stay i am more or less sure that i wont sometimes i feel i am not built for it that i am not strong enough for this country
5897663 sometimes i feel that just by existing i am always wrong here but i cannot live with personal attacks now i cannot bear it
5897664 on the condition that you do not print my name
5897665 hans married my grandmother erna after she divorced my grandfather
5897666 i have neither any blood nor dna from adolf and his family
5897667 but i always appreciated that she told me the truth about it we spoke frankly i never heard that normal german lie you hear so often from that generation
5897668 she became one of those german ladies who cleared up after all the bombing
5897669 that is all that my mother brought home from the war i keep them to honor her
5897670 i saw my father very seldom and the times i saw him i was so proud to have a father that it was not the time to ask what he did in the war he died when i was 19 so i never asked him what he did
5897671 it was not a sudden light from heaven that came down
5897672 how could people be so stupid as to elect a person who was writing things like this its awful
5897673 i dont think you can really understand how awful it is if you dont read it in german i put it away but i keep it here
5897674 you raise up an army if you think you have to use it
5897675 i felt at home i was no longer living in a conflict i didnt have to reject the older generation and i thought i had met for the first time a nationality that at that point in history today it is more problematic still had good reasons to be proud of itself
5897676 the sharp distinction between the generations that committed the crimes and the generation born after wouldnt exist
5897677 when i hear my own son speak as i did last weekend i sat like this
5897678 two of my sons are chauvinists and one of them is even partially racist i cant listen to fascistic discourse i dont suffer that
5897679 each time i hear it is another time too much if the holocaust and the third reich have really somehow shaped me i am a sworn democrat i believe that democracy has to prove itself by keeping the rights of its minorities
5897680 i see that soldier trampling that child and in the end killing it and i remember that kind of aggression i remember the feeling of the child too i remember both i could see my father or my grandfather really standing there
5897681 is that since i came to israel that feeling isnt there any more
5897682 it has sometimes been used in an enlarged sense as comprehending all the explanations maxims and ceremonies which have been traditionally handed down to the jews but in that more limited acceptation in which it is intimately connected with the symbolic science of freemasonry the cabala may be defined to be a system of philosophy which embraces certain mystical interpretations of scripture and metaphysical and spiritual beings
5897683 a secret science which treats in a mystical and enigmatical manner of things divine angelical theological celestial and metaphysical the subjects being enveloped in striking symbols and secret modes of teaching much use is made of it in the advanced degrees and entire rites have been constructed on its principles hence it demands a place in any general work on freemasonry
5897684 that one key ritual in freemasonry involves drinking from human skulls
5897685 freemasonry is the instrument created to carry out this return to paganism
5897686 all the masonic associations owe to it their secrets and their symbols
5897687 there is the branch of the scottish rite and the branch of the shriners scottish freemasonry is the christian branch while the shriners are actually the islamic branch
5897688 we are connected via our souls to the source of creation and we can transform the flow of creation
5897689 cabalists teaches at the moon is the mystical vessel in which souls are gathered before they are released to the world
5897690 the cabalists teach that everything we do stirs up a corresponding energy in other realms of reality actions words or thoughts set up reverberations in the universe
5897691 in physical reality every move we make is dependent upon electromagnetic energy in the metaphysical realm rather than call this energy electromagnetic we could call it angelic demonic every move they make is supported by an angel or demon moreover everything we do creates new angels and demons the metaphysical magnets associated with the god realms are called angels and those with the satanic realms are called demons
5897692 from noon until midnight the sun appears to be declining which means that the power of loving kindness is waning when the sun reaches its lowest ebb the time in which the energy of darkness is strongest accusing angels have their greatest power the kabbalist says that this point is the darkest of the night the moment when restriction and judgment are at their full power if we were abandoned in the mystical midnight of creation we would disappear
5897693 angelic and demonic energies are not independent and self sufficient but are parts of the system of the universal ebb and flow
5897694 cooper david a god is a verb new york new york riverhead brooks 1997 p 143
5897695 when we call upon angels to be with us we and two on infinite resource of goodwill it is as if we plugged into the magnetic core of the earth to keep ourselves centered archangels represent the god center of the universe they draw nourishment from its infinite supply
5897696 the lower earthly human being and the upper mystical human being in which the godhead is manifested as shape belong together and are unthinkable without one another
5897697 this manual of kabbalah will prepare one to hear the words of g d see authentic visions smell the supernal beauty touch his her grace and taste the delights of eden
5897698 as rabbi levi yitzhak of berdicheve said at every instant all universes received existence and sustenance from god it is human beings however who motivate this sustenance and transmit it to all worlds when a person nullifies the sense of self completely and thereby attaches thought to nothingness then a new sustenance flows to all universes
5897699 our day to day actions words and thoughts continuously affect our sense of harmony with the universe
5897700 the teachings of reincarnation are of value when we have nowhere else to turn in the tragedy of the death
5897701 the zohar discusses the universe as a whole in far broader terms than merely the physical universe indeed the physical universe as vast as it may be is dwarfed in comparison with the mystical universe that embraces angelic and demonic realms whereas the physical universe is measured in time and distance the mystical universe is measured in terms of levels of awareness these levels should not be viewed as separate boundaries for awareness is a continuum
5897702 the zohar says to create the world it ein sof infinite nothingness emanated a secret spark awareness from which emerged and radiated all light the upper world was constituted of this light then a different dimension of light a light without brightness lower consciousness was fashioned into the lower world as it is composed of unilluminated light the lower world is attracted to the upper world
5897703 this end of heaven is called who there is another below called what what distinguishes the two the first concealed one called who can be questioned once a human being questions and searches contemplating and knowing rung after rung to the very last rung once one reaches there what what do you know what have you contemplated or what have you searched all this concealed as before
5897704 when concealed of all concealed emerged on being revealed it produced at first a single point which ascended to become thought within it drew all drawings grave to all and ravings carving within the conceal the holy lamp a graving of one hidden design only of holies a deep structure emerging from fat called mi who origin of structure existent and nonexistent deep and hidden called by no name but who seekng to be revealed to be named it garbed itself in a splendid radiant garment and created elleh these elleh attained the name these letters joined with those culimnating in the name elohim
5897705 when the wildest fictions are so much less improbable than the facts
5897706 my dear tommy you and i have long cherished an affection for that elementary type of tale which americans call the dime novel and which we know as the shocker the romance where the incidents defy the probabilities and march just inside the borders of the possible during an illness last winter i exhausted my store of those aids to cheerfulness and was driven to write one for myself this little volume is the result and i should like to put your name on it in memory of our long friendship in the days when the wildest fictions are so much less improbable than the facts

5897711 all his yarns about the balkans and the jew anarchists and the foreign office conference were eye wash and so was greek pm karolides and yet not quite as you shall hear i had staked everything on my belief in his story and had been let down here was his book telling me a different tale and instead of being once bit twice shy i believed it absolutely why i dont know it rang desperately true and the first yarn if you understand me had been in a queer way true also in spirit

5897790 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5897791 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5897792 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves
5897793 the witnesses may be mistaken but we have to treat any of these reports with the utmost seriousness
5897794 well continue to try and seek some assistance from the community and also conduct patrols in order to identify these kids or just get a little bit more information to ensure that no one is at risk down there
5897795 at this stage until we can confirm either way the contractors have been contacted by police and weve got to try and secure a bit more information again before they start their activities as usual business
5897796 the prime importance is to identify if there is an issue down there and to get the kids some help if there is
5897797 these kids were also asked if they owned any of the bedding and if they were sleeping in the bin and they all said no
5897798 its not the end of the investigation we want to identify these kids so we can contact their parents and explain to them what a dangerous practice it is to play in a skip bin because if someone does fall asleep and the bin gets emptied the ramifications can be horrendous
5897799 the department of community services is working with the police to try and find these children
5897800 until these children are found thats when the department of community services will come into action to work with the children and the family but most importantly we need to find who these children are

5897820 turning childrens series into inappropriate text because of psychological problems
5897821 lets use this as a carrot and try to get some film production out of this
5897822 the studio could come in and say well do some of this demolition for you and save you the cost of doing it
5897823 the notion that someone out there might be looking for a stadium to blow up and we just happened to have one is actually good news
5897824 britains six gold three silver and two bronze medals in track and road cycling have come on the back of tactics and technology of australian coaches
5897825 we demand from the government not to target people randomly
5897826 they should target only terrorists or those who make trouble what wrongs have our children women and cattle committed
5897827 the emergency situation in bajaur has displaced between 250 000 and 300 000 people we consider people who challenge the governments writ and create conditions for military operations as being responsible for their displacement and ordeal
5897828 the entire valley of bajaur from one side to the other has been completely evacuated
5897829 some families have left one or two people behind to look after their houses but even they have to live on the mountains because of bombing fears the people here are very kind they have moved their families to their relatives to allow our women and children to live in their houses
5897830 whatever help we have given you so far was on an emergency basis and might not be sufficient kunar is like your own home and you can live here as long as you want
5897831 you can go back whenever you think the security situation back home is stable
5897832 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual we call on moscow to demonstrate both in word and deed its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
5897833 it seems to me that nato is trying to make an aggressor out of a victim to whitewash a criminal regime to rescue a chaotic regime and is on the road towards rearming the current georgian leadership
5897834 future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president dmitry medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak he signed together with the president of georgia
5897835 one can presume this issue will have to be taken into view
5897836 we dont see much change in the russian forces that were there
5897837 we are in fact carrying out this procedure and ive even given you the division number and this process is mandatory for us
5897838 as far as the rear technical and other units are concerned they will remain here longer for carrying out tasks of a humanitarian nature
5897839 five russian prisoners including two pilots were exchanged for 15 georgians
5897840 i had a chance to talk to one of them corporal gocha chachanidze from the 2nd infantry brigade and he said that he spent one week in a hospital in vladikavkaz in north ossetia he said he was wounded and then taken prisoner and he said he was treated normally in vladikavkaz
5897841 if it rolled in after august 6 it needs to roll out that would be in keeping with the russians commitment on withdrawal
5897842 we are now waiting for georgian president mikheil saakashvilis reaction
5897843 this will be done after the format of their presence in the region has been approved
5897844 for new delhi musharraf was seen as being very keen on sustaining the peace process between the two countries to moving forward in terms of the talks to really agreeing in many ways with india over what it saw as the key issues for example of building confidence between the two countries
5897845 so musharrafs departure for new delhi actually does raise some hopes in terms of a new democratic pakistan
5897846 but it also raises concerns over whether the new leadership in pakistan that makes decisions on relations with india will really want to move forward in terms of the peace process that musharraf clearly did want to do
5897847 you have of course the prime minister and the foreign minister but you also have the leaders of the two major coalition partners in the government the ppp and the plm n you also have in terms of foreign relations the army and the isi secret service which has a critical role for neighborhood policy issues and you have in some cases the judiciary as well in terms of the legal challenges to the regime and the impact of those challenges on foreign policy
5897848 i dont think its up to gilani in islamabad because whatever dealing india has with a country like pakistan and also whatever dealings pakistan has with afghanistan are determined and underwritten in a sense by the military
5897849 the pakistani military is the arbiter of deciding and calibrating the level of talks with india and the level of relations with india
5897850 but the army itself in pakistan is in a bit of turmoil because the army is anxious to remain in the back seat and not be very overt like with musharraf so in a sense pakistan is in a complete state of flux and chaos india is fairly low down on their radar
5897851 but india on the other hand is very concerned that because of the growth of turmoil inside pakistan india may become a target as a diversionary tactic by the pakistani military and the intelligence services so india has more to fear from chaos in pakistan than pakistan has to fear from the lack of progress in peace talks
5897852 india is a little tentative about dealing with the civilian government in islamabad because over the last three or four months the peace process that began in 2004 under president musharraf has been crumbling partially because of a series of serious bombings in india in which india has accused pakistan of being guilty of interference with its intelligence service and particularly because of the indian embassy bombing in kabul which india claimed along with the cia had been supported by the isi the pakistani spy agency
5897853 it really remains to be seen how they can organize themselves and take the peace process forward because the indian government was somewhat content to meet with musharraf in fact over the last three or four years they had made some progress in peace talks
5897854 what we have seen in the last few months is really a deterioration of relations between musharraf and karzai personally
5897855 the relationship between these two countries is far greater than the personality of their leaders there are a number of factors that will continue regarding the current policies of pakistan toward afghanistan
5897856 we have clearly concerns over what is happening in the tribal areas in pakistan and the implications in afghanistan
5897857 the afghans of course have raised this they have also threatened a more proactive military stance so i dont think there will be much of a change in terms of the actual relationship other than the fact that the differing personalities of the two will not really be there that does provide some potential for improvement in presentation at least but it is unlikely to see much of an improvement in substance
5897858 pakistan under musharraf was looking at the issue of islamic extremism in the context of its regional interests
5897859 so there was not always harmony or a common approach to extremism in the area now the civilian government the elected government of pakistan is facing that challenge
5897860 if the elected government of pakistan can stay united and respond to these challenges in a unified way and also control the interference of the isi intelligence services they might be able to respond in an effective way
5897861 otherwise the disunity among different factions in pakistans elected government can create a vacuum that vacuum can be exploited by the extremist groups they will have a free hand and expand their crossborder attacks into afghanistan
5897862 from washingtons perspective the trend that we are looking at more assertive policy both in terms of rhetoric and at times in terms of substance will continue
5897863 washington is going toward an election date very soon later this year so there will be more pressure for washington to deal firmly with pakistan
5897864 is that washington will have to broaden its contacts in pakistan the range of officials at a very senior level that washington has been dealing with now is far broader earlier it was fairly safe to deal largely only with musharraf today that is not the case so there are more complexities and concerns
5897865 the current round of agitation in kashmir for the first time in almost two decades has nothing really to do with pakistan
5897866 it is purely a home grown problem which is very complicated over the transfer of land to hindus in the kashmir valley which is muslim dominated but the agitations that are going on in kashmir are definitely disturbing because they are pro pakistan indian planners believe that pakistan is in such turmoil that it cannot really take advantage of indias vulnerability in kashmir but it is only a matter of time before that situation changes and indias confrontation over kashmir with pakistan begins all over again
5897867 i am ready to discuss anything and everything but not under circumstances where russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia not under circumstances where russian forces are not withdrawing as the russian president promised
5897868 what is a promise worth made on paper and made in different contacts with allied leaders when that promise is not fulfilled
5897869 this alliance nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union in achieving a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe a line between those who were fortunate enough to make it into the trans atlantic structures and those who still aspire to those transatlantic structures
5897870 we are ready and president sarkozy has raised this prospect the prospect of convening a european council in the coming days if necessary to adopt a stronger and more determined attitude of the 27 members of the eu
5897871 we were lucky to get the cease fire let me tell you
5897872 the principles set out below are supported by the presidents of russia and france and the presidents of russia and france call on the parties to sign this document
5897873 we have signed the document that was countersigned by the presidents of russia georgia and france as a guarantor from the eu
5897874 that group has become much more active in the last two years
5897875 the number of attacks have increased although this is from quite a low base the attacks have become much more spectacular the attacks have become much more targeted against institutions of the algerian state
5897876 i think primarily the attacks should be seen through the lens of the civil war experience of the attack on the algerian state
5897877 firstly if the terrorists really wanted to attack the west then the way that they would do that is by attacking the oil and gas infrastructure
5897878 what you have is a situation where you have an already established terrorist network with with tentacles already within society already within algeria which has been able to replenish itself through smuggling and trafficking and organized crime networks through the sahara
5897879 it an alleged threat and it is not true the government of sudan is a serious government and it is totally committed to its obligations especially when it comes to agreement signed with other organizations and especially the united nations and the african union im not aware of any threat that has been towards to the united nations regarding their very existence in the sudan if the icc has and the judges have confirmed the indictment of the president
5897880 i would rather say that the government is totally committed to its obligations and we have never threatened the united nations peacekeeping force here in sudan whether in darfur or in the south
5897881 in fact they usually do that not only in sudan but everywhere just in case because it happens that when the icc announced its indictment of the president of sudan some of the un peacekeepers here have been relocated outside of the sudan in case anything might happen and this proves just a precautionary measure and because nothing happened and things are going normal in sudan and now those are taken away from sudan the peacekeepers have been flown back to sudan
5897882 although saakashvili signed the six principles peace plan we can see that this order is not being implemented
5897883 i wonder if the list of 80 captives had been prepared beforehand to get on our nerves
5897884 arrangements are currently underway to prepare material bases for peacekeeping outposts as an extra security measure under moscow agreements
5897885 we will keep the serviceable weapons and equipment and destroy the rest to prevent them from falling into the hands of those who started this bloody war
5897886 which is most importantly support for georgias democracy secondly a very strong message that the russian president ought to keep his word and third a very clear statement of principle from this alliance that a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a transatlantic future is unacceptable
5897887 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to honor the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5897888 it means that were sending immediately 20 political and military observers who are unarmed who are basically there to observe the cease fire and in that sense i would say that its a crucial step in us stabilizing the whole region
5897889 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5897890 to distort irans scientific achievements by portraying them as a military issue
5897891 enemies of the progress of the iranian nation have not spared any efforts to portray irans scientific technical and peaceful achievements as a military success
5897892 after testing the rocket tehran announced that it will take some time for iran to put a satellite into orbit with this rocket it means that iran still doesnt have the technology used by western countries
5897893 in the past similar words were said about irans nuclear capabilities therefore iran still at least with its latest rocket launch cannot enter a competition with countries like france or the eu in general the u s or even israel
5897894 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the u s from attacking its nuclear sites
5897895 the process went smoothly it was mediated by the french ambassador
5897896 we agreed on future exchanges if there are other prisoners
5897897 of course we will have to wait a few days to carry out this six point peace plan
5897898 must do what is necessary to neutralize all possibility of revenge by saakashvili who is the aggressor
5897899 were looking at a solution where we would be able to send 20 osce military monitors today with 80 to follow up in the next few days
5897900 we need to open the door to get military monitors in
5897901 weve had russian bear flights along the norwegian coast even along the borders with the united states which is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5897902 its about the size of my bathroom with three desks i just feel sorry for my staff
5897903 i just think its a completely immature and inappropriate way to demonstrate power and control
5897904 justice has finally been done that monster will finally be gone
5897905 it was the number of times he was accused of doing these things just too many times from too many people by girls who shouldnt have the detail that they had
5897906 based on the examination of reports of her erratic behaviour a senior medical officer of the all india institute of medical sciences opined presence of a psychiatric illness in her and advised psychiatric opinion to assess her condition
5897907 when the officer was informed about initiation of the inquiry on tuesday august 19 she indicated that she would not appear in any proceedings and warned that the department would face the consequences

5897909 we were looking for an under the radar sort of product
5897910 our eight distributors cover only about half the country and there has been very little penetration of international markets so far
5897911 the penetration of the potential market is only about 2 percent
5897912 so with a market so large and penetration so small we figure our main challenge is just to go out and sell
5897913 digital sabah is the first ever complete high resolution digital dataset of sabah
5897914 the digital sabah program involves a public private partnership that is a business model for future commercial and government partnerships digital sabah will help the state of sabah and lands and surveys department in managing the mount kinabalu world heritage site and sustaining environmentally conscious development programs like the sabah development corridor moving forward while protecting our coastal regions and virgin rain forests
5897915 having high quality elevation data in the early planning stage for major development programs is crucial for responsible decision making when developing one of the few remaining rain forests on this planet
5897916 we are proud to be able to supply such important data to a government agency that clearly recognizes the significance of planning to protect this valuable habitat for future generations
5897917 the ftc advises you keep the following in mind when considering a business opportunity if an ad includes an earnings claim but not the number and percentage of people who achieved it the seller is probably violating the law search the business opportunitys franchise disclosure document for a statement about previous purchasers if the document says there havent been any but the seller offers a list of references they probably are phony get the list of 10 previous purchasers and interview each in person preferably where their business operates
5897918 i have kept my distance at times because i am still in love with you

5897927 i am going to the store to get quarters for the washing machine

5897944 bahwa rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pernah menemui kami kemudian mengizinkan kami untuk melakukan nikah mutah
5897945 telah sah bahwa nikah mutah dulu pernah diperbolehkan pada awal awal islam kemudian datang hadits hadits yang shahih bahwa nikah tersebut tidak diperbolehkan lagi kesepakatan ulama telah menyatakan keharaman nikah tersebut
5897946 wahai manusia sesungguhnya aku dulu pernah mengizinkan kalian untuk melakukan nikah mutah namun sekarang allah azza wa jalla telah mengharamkan nikah tersebut sampai hari kiamat
5897947 sesungguhnya nikah mutah itu adalah agamaku dan agama pendahuluku barangsiapa mengamalkannya maka dia telah mengamalkan agama kami sedangkan barangsiapa mengingkarinya maka dia telah mengingkari agama kami dan meyakini selain agama kami
5897948 bila dia mengharapkan wajah allah ikhlas maka tidaklah dia membicarakan keutamaan nikah tersebut kecuali allah tulis baginya satu kebaikan apabila dia mulai mendekatinya maka allah ampuni dosanya apabila dia telah mandi dari berjima ketika nikah mutah pen maka allah ampuni dosanya sebanyak air yang mengalir pada rambutnya
5897949 barangsiapa melakukan nikah mutah satu kali maka derajatnya seperti al husain barangsiapa melakukannya dua kali maka derajatnya seperti al hasan barangsiapa melakukannya tiga kali maka derajatnya seperti ali radhiyallahu anhu dan barangsiapa melakukannya sebanyak empat kali maka derajatnya seperti aku
5897950 apa yang aku katakan kepada dia wanita yang akan dinikahi pen bila aku telah berduaan dengannya
5897951 engkau katakan aku menikahimu secara mutah berdasarkan kitabullah dan sunnah nabi nya namun engkau tidak mendapatkan warisan dariku dan tidak pula memberikan warisan apapun kepadaku selama sehari atau setahun dengan upah senilai dirham demikian dan demikian
5897952 tidak apa apa menikahi seorang wanita yang masih perawan bila dia ridha walaupun tanpa ijin kedua orang tuanya
5897953 sesungguhnya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah melarang nikah mutah dan daging keledai piaraan pada saat perang khaibar
5897954 what fucking countdown the countdown till its legal to have sex with her cos thats whats really stopping me isnt it the legalities of it all the laws are not an issue here pal
5897955 thats terrible how would you like it if i said something like that to you in fact lets just switch places you get behind the bar and ill come in as a customer
5897956 you know selling china in 2008 is like selling america in 1908 sure lets say the market goes down another 40 so what you look back over 100 years you look back from the beauty of 1928 or even 1938 in the depths of the and there is somebody who bought shares in 1908 he was still a lot better off having not sold in 1908
5897957 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5897958 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5897959 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5897960 if he mugabe goes further and appoints a cabinet it will be against the letter and spirit of the mou
5897961 we cannot forget the crimes he has committed against the nation
5897962 the rapid transfer of the green performance eco ceed concepts features into production eco versions of the ceed demonstrates kias vision for the way ahead to a greener future
5897963 our new eco range will also confirm kias commitment to creating environmentally friendly and fuel efficient production models without losing sight of customer expectations for cars with a sporty design and fun to drive performance
5897964 two consecutive elevated readings on core consumer prices combined with todays worrisome report on producer prices will be hard for the fed to overlook at its next meeting
5897965 that said recent and further evidence of significant economic weakness makes it unlikely for the fed to push up interest rates this year
5897966 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5897967 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5897968 the u s economy is growing and showing great flexibility but were in a period of slow growth
5897969 when the housing sector returns we expect broader economic activity to return as well
5897970 its not a secret that we are in serious settlement discussions with a large segment of the remainder of the cases
5897971 what were trying to do is factor age out of decision making
5897972 this is tougher for me as i have been through four rounds of the 100m and this is the first time ive had to do eight rounds in a championships
5897973 im feeling it but i feel like ive got one run left in me
5897974 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5897975 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5897976 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5897977 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5897978 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5897979 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5897980 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5897981 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5897982 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5897983 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5897984 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5897985 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5897986 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
5897987 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5897988 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
5897989 so spielberg went off and made indiana jones who i reckon to be a period james bond
5897990 poses a high risk to the preservation of native plants and several crops in the farming sectors of the islands
5897991 society has changed fundamentally and the measure of it is that the official fatwa religious edict of old no longer has the hold it had
5897992 a girl or young man who hears a fatwa doesnt just obey he goes to google and hears other opinions and discusses
5897993 do you know the city will be larger than washington
5897994 saudi arabia today doesnt offer the kind of services that are required
5897995 there is a lack of infrastructure and basic urban aesthetic beauty is also missing
5897996 we have 60 percent of our population under 30 and these people need places to live so we are going to create the educational opportunities for them to come study and work
5897997 they are white elephants and not economically sustainable without huge subsidies
5897998 its hard to find serious economists who arent in the pay of the saudis who think it is sustainable
5897999 the king goes to parliament to talk about the need for women to participate but its all nonsense
5898000 the king has good intentions but when it goes down to lower levels there is resistance
5898001 we are putting our faith in king abdullah because obviously hes a reformist
5898002 he represents optimism and tolerance and a progressive way of thinking
5898003 this is like the ultimate youve got striking youve got grappling youve got weapons anything goes
5898004 it gives you the idea of really finding out what martial arts are like not just doing pretty forms
5898005 when i face someone with a stick i get hit and i hit him everything else all the little things the bills the reports are gone
5898006 it makes me feel alive i have never felt better than when i am doing this
5898007 its about developing it in a healthy way before it discharges inappropriately
5898008 its like these extreme experiences where they drop a group of three or four guys without food and water into the middle of the wilderness and they have to survive for four or five days and they come out feeling like they are brothers
5898009 we are here to test ourselves and test each other but the default assumption is that we are going to care for each other
5898010 oddly enough what i feel is love honestly i wish i could find a church with the same spirit of support and love
5898011 youve put yourself through an experience that most people would go out of their way to avoid
5898012 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5898013 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5898014 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5898015 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5898016 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5898017 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5898018 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5898019 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5898020 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5898021 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5898022 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5898023 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5898024 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless

5898028 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the
5898029 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5898030 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5898031 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5898032 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems

5898090 we are asking the government and the milf to give primacy to the peace process in order to resolve issues
5898091 let us be circumspect on this thing and not exacerbate the situation by saying irresponsible side comments there must be a steadfast solution to this situation
5898092 we condemn the raging war in mindanao the burning of churches and the mounting destruction of heavy collateral damage inflicted on innocent civilian sectors of society muslims and christians alike

5898108 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5898109 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5898110 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along

5898113 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
5898114 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5898115 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved

5898120 i know there are some things that all the federal parties will want to do that will speak to ontarios needs on a short term basis
5898121 but my concern is really the long term what are we doing to do to address some of these issues that have been dragging on now for decades

5898253 i told derek that his wife has to be totally on board because it will never work if its just him
5898254 hes very capable of doing both its just at what point in time is he going to be satisfied as a football coach and then go into administration

5898258 what if im not ready for this kind of responsibility
5898259 my hamstring got tight on me the past couple of days
5898260 just as a precautionary coach grobe felt that it wasnt worth the risk of running around and maybe hurting myself tonight ill be fine for next thursday it was just precautionary
5898261 our running backs had a good night tonight did some good things c j washington did some good things its nice to see a little bit of depth at that running back position
5898262 its so hard to tell because some of the breakdowns that we had you dont know whether the quarterback held the ball too long or whether the line broke down you really have to go back and look at the film i thought that our kids competed really well i thought that our
5898263 the ap ranking is a good feeling but at the same time our guys are mature enough to know you have to earn that ranking right now it feels good but its also a little scary because it puts that added pressure on you
5898264 thats what hurt the offense and what hurt us in the opener at boston college and almost cost us against maryland so thats the biggest thing for me that and taking control of the offense i feel like were in a pretty good place right now i like where our offense is brett hodges and i both have a really good grasp of whats going on
5898265 when i first started playing last year i felt like i needed to prove myself after what we did the year before i felt like i needed to be the hero and make a bunch of plays but that was the last thing i needed to do once i got comfortable and back in the moment i stopped turning the ball over and we started doing better once you turn the ball over it screws up the whole flow of the offense
5898266 it just got tight on me the past couple of days and just as a precautionary coach grobe felt that it wasnt worth the risk of running around and maybe hurting myself tonight ill be fine for next thursday it was just precautionary i think it was good though because brett hodges hasnt got a lot of good reps with the first team offense everyone knows that the second quarterback needs to be just as ready as the first quarterback brett played well tonight he made good decisions
5898267 it was a pop next thing you know it was a bunch of smoke and it was in flames
5898268 we have hurt hearts just knowing that there are hundreds of families that look forward to this truck pulling up
5898269 if a random act of kindness could happen for us we a truly living the legacy of what we promote that it is a full circle that the love that we give out will come back to us
5898270 someone might think its just a truck but to r place its the lifeline because we are a delivery service
5898271 its people like you and the community that make it all happen so im glad you guys exist
5898272 which highlights the need for it managers to begin to implement mobile device policies as ever more enterprises look to expand their mobile workforces
5898273 enterprises are fighting a losing battle against employees when it comes to mobile devices and they should consider supporting a limited selection of devices rather than banning them outright
5898274 allowing a range of the most popular devices will improve employee and encourage more of them to embrace mobile devices and improve their productivity when away from the office
5898275 so far very few it departments have yielded to these requests and are refusing to be responsible for managing such a wide variety of mobile devices however the iphone has set a new standard for device userability and the trend of consumerization is going to continue

5898285 the nonsense that is the global warming debate can be likened to a don king production where the two main antagonists well deserved ones at that are still hours away from the main fight instead we have under cards that leave us simply wondering if we will ever get to the real deal
5898286 resolved sufficient evidence exists that human activity has probably altered the pace or direction of climatological change and will cause profound climate change within the next fifty years
5898287 at his age injuries like that become harder to heal
5898288 though there is evidence both for and against the existence of a detectable anthropogenic signal in the tropical cyclone climate record to date no firm conclusion can be made on this point no individual tropical cyclone can be directly attributed to climate change
5898289 numerous hurricane meteorologists agree that the historical data has not produced any evidence of changes due to climate change in the number or intensity of hurricanes particularly in the atlantic basin and even globally
5898290 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
5898291 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases i have been a specialist in hurricane climate data for close to three decades and others who know the databases well agree with what i am saying
5898292 the biggest fallacy is that people think that a hurricane feeds off a warm ocean and if the ocean gets warmer we will have more intense hurricanes
5898293 but there are other factors involved such as vertical which is the difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere
5898294 everything else being equal if you warm the ocean under a storm you might get a stronger storm but everything else is not equal
5898295 warming may increase vertical shear and therefore inhibit storms the ocean itself warming is such a little effect
5898296 i am skeptical of those who would state those results as something like an undeniable fact for the future
5898297 i did not say if there is global warming it would be man made
5898298 not all scientists agree that the warming weve seen is necessarily anthropogenic it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who dont buy into anthropogenic global warming
5898299 there is now a near consensus that global air temperatures are increasing however there is no consensus on how this has affected the temperature of the worlds oceans and in particular in the atlantic ocean or how much of the recent warming trend is attributable to mans activities
5898300 recent scientific research indicates that in a future warming world the atlantic may experience two primary effects related to hurricane development
5898301 first a warmer environment may continue to elevate sea surface temperatures ssts thereby providing more fuel for tropical cyclones to develop and intensify
5898302 so while it is true that warmer ssts may lead to more frequent hurricane activity elevated wind shear may counteract or possibly even overturn this effect
5898303 which of these factors critical to the development of tropical cyclones will ultimately win out is the subject of lively debate within the scientific community and beyond
5898304 for example simulations of tropical cyclone activity carried out at the gfdl using climate conditions projected for the 21 st century indicate the potential for decreased hurricane activity under more pronounced global warming conditions and cautions against a reliance on statistical extrapolations of recently elevated activity levels through the end of the century
5898305 it is not clear what effect global warming is having and will have on the frequency intensity and geographical distribution of hurricanes in the atlantic basin
5898306 however models are less clear about hurricane activity in individual ocean basins
5898307 for instance in the atlantic some models suggest a long term increase in frequency with others suggesting a decrease
5898308 the evidence shows that there has been an increase in the average intensity of hurricanes in the atlantic since the 1970s and an increase in frequency since 1995 but it is not clear what contribution if any global warming has made to these changes
5898309 professor gray is absolutely correct that hurricane formation and development depend on factors such as sea surface temperature
5898310 however it would be wrong to suggest that these factors could only be affected by natural changes in climate and not by man made global warming
5898311 both natural climate variability and man made global warming influence hurricane formation and development
5898312 the real question is to what extent they contribute over the time scale of interest this is still an open scientific question
5898313 for the layman there is sometimes a tendency to regard every new discovery or scientific finding from the latest published paper as an inviolate fact
5898314 in reality rarely is there ever a last and final word in studies of complex systems such as earths environment rather science is a dynamic process based on the scientific method in which researchers test hypotheses leading to new discoveries but also reexamine earlier theories and try to improve build upon or extend them
5898315 there are those who want to attribute any perceived increase in natural disasters to anthropomorphic global warming

5898325 is an immense problem and its simply not going away its no longer a question of solving it but one of managing it
5898326 many of our participants noticed that their computers were slowing down which means that while they were surfing unbeknownst to them web sites were installing malware
5898327 in just 30 days there was quite a noticeable change in the system performance of their computers notably showing just how much malware was being installed without their knowledge
5898328 i dont see it as a threat but im not a dissident
5898329 the only people worried about being found out are those who are doing stuff they shouldnt be doing
5898330 there are many ways to identify where a document came from
5898331 you can go back and look at the url you can identify every server that e mail or document came through to be printed its really not the printer itself that is the leak into your life its the computer
5898332 i dont see it as a threat but im not a dissident he quipped
5898333 what am i worried about i dont have anything to hide
5898334 life begins at 360 button my blinking dice from first insurance funding and my travelers umbrella flashlight also noticed quite a few persons taking advantage of the dark and raiding the wonderful cookies at the liberty booth yes i had at least my share
5898335 its their information just as in every other system they allow us access to it but it is their information in some cases the agency and the carrier both store copies of that data but it is still the customers and we are responsible to protect it
5898336 in my opinion the fewer places it is stored the better because having it in multiple locations makes it more difficult to access
5898337 being that a majority of agencies are small to mid sized 18 to 20 employees and under that does not allow them to have significant budgets for data security carriers have those resources available to provide proper security for the data and thats where it should reside
5898338 future technologies dictate that data shouldnt be residing in multiple locations so agents should not be storing the data
5898339 we need to push the technology to be where we want it to be so agents can access the data and not have to store it because every time there is a copy of the data there is another place for to get it
5898340 in addition every time you move it something will be missing because there are database structure inconsistencies so where is the correct data something has changed
5898341 especially if you no longer have a contract with that company
5898342 this can be resolved however we need industry cooperation carrier to carrier consistent solid security and a means of authentication for all carriers right now they are all different
5898343 there are way too many holes in security for both agents and carriers a carrier changes passwords every 30 90 days how do i keep up with that
5898344 an electronic certificate that would authenticate me even though i dont have a contract with them any more
5898345 technically the agent independent agent i assume owns the data of the book it writes
5898346 in other words insurers need this data in order to properly identify the most profitable products most profitable customers and to identify new products and customers i e perform business intelligence
5898347 there has an ongoing debate for years as to who really owns the customer a number of carriers believe and act as if they own the customer this thinking seems to have evolved as carriers began to provide more and more services directly to the insured including direct billing policy changes first reporting of loss loss control services and claims analysis in effect they are managing the customer experience
5898348 seeing the need to become much more protective of their books
5898349 the data today in my opinion should reside with both the agent and carrier both parties need to thoroughly understand their respective books of business so that cross selling and profitability targets can take place
5898350 they basically rely on their carriers to do these analyses
5898351 what can each party carrier and agent do with the data
5898352 agents and insurers should focus more on creating value and less on trying to hoard information
5898353 i think its a mistake to think in terms of
5898354 obviously some agents are afraid that insurers will dis intermediate them if they give up control and some insurers are afraid they are more likely to have their policies
5898355 homes became more affordable because median income and interest rates remained about the same throughout the country as home prices continued to fall
5898356 this is definitely positive news because more people can afford to buy a home
5898357 still actual sales havent picked up because people are waiting on the sidelines as they fear home prices will continue to decline
5898358 prices went down a lot in both areas but they fell a lot more in los angeles
5898359 prices are declining very rapidly in california because of a large supply and low demand

5898520 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5898521 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5898522 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5898523 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

5898606 sluggish supplies have prompted a cottage industry of doomsday predictions that the worlds oil production has reached a peak but many energy experts say these peak oil theories are misplaced they say the world is not running out of oil rather the companies that know the most about how to produce oil are running out of places to drill
5898607 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
5898608 todays markets are so tight that the slightest shortfalls can push up prices
5898609 oil production has failed to catch up with surging consumption in recent years a disparity that propelled oil prices to records this year
5898610 the scope of the supply problem became more clear in the latest quarter when the five biggest publicly traded oil companies including exxon mobil said their oil output had declined by a total of 614 000 barrels a day even as they posted 44 billion in profits it was the steepest of five consecutive quarters of declines

5898625 more and more young people are participating in olympic sports said dr

5898627 this is the culmination of a 100 year dream to have an olympic games in china the olympics have had a feel good effect on chinese society which they probably will elect to keep up

5898643 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5898644 we are worried the fcc will buckle and allow white space to be used by personal portable devices seeking wireless services
5898645 the radio frequency environment is going to become more crowded and more difficult to use
5898646 in that case the number of wireless microphones used will be reduced significantly and it cost big productions millions of dollars to redesign what they do
5898647 everybody is not only angry and upset they are very very worried
5898648 from the beginning we have said that no white space device should come to market unless the fcc signs off on it
5898649 we have a limited amount of engineering resources and there are hard costs such as fcc licenses that we have had to get

5898674 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
5898675 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
5898676 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
5898677 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
5898678 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit
5898679 but at this point it is certainly hard to recommend extra supplements when we dont have proof of benefit
5898680 what we can recommend is a diet with fruits and vegetables that have antioxidant vitamins in them

5898689 our parents are doing more fundraising than they have in the past
5898690 its not like the school is getting gutted and the programs are going away

5898813 i stayed here a long time it is a combination that is difficult for any type of pitcher you could be a finesse guy or a power guy and the difficulty of pitching deep into ballgames and consistently giving your team a chance to win its very hard

5898819 this result was due primarily to reduce values in equity and debt markets and also outflows from perpetuals credit and fixed interest and australian equities institutional businesses

5898852 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5898853 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5898854 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5898855 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5898856 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5898857 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5898858 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5898859 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5898860 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5898861 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5898862 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5898863 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5898864 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5898869 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5898870 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5898871 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5898872 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5898873 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5898874 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5898875 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5898876 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5898877 roving around georgia destroying any property including railway bridges and docks that might conceivably have a military use
5898878 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5898879 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5898880 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5898881 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5898882 not to say were not going to make it work this year cause were going to make it work thats really the message to our parents we have a great board this year but we will do what it takes
5898883 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5898884 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5898885 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5898886 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5898887 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5898888 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5898889 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5898890 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5898891 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5898892 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5898893 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5898894 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5898895 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5898896 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5898897 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5898898 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home

5898912 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

5898962 la consideraci n de la violencia contra las mujeres no est arraigado en la sociedad canaria
5898963 se necesita un trabajo pedag gico y un cambio de sensibilidad importante para acabar con este delito encubierto
5898964 es muy grave que s lo un dos por ciento de la sociedad vea como una preocupaci n social la violencia de g nero por debajo incluso del terrorismo

5898974 first and foremost the inspiration for making mommas man way before i cast my parents and way before thinking of mikeys story
5898975 just seeing everybody i know move out of the city and seeing all their parents starting to leave just having an idea what its going to be like not to have that place i really wanted to preserve it on film i have the feeling im not really going to be able to see this movie until im sitting there with a kid of my own showing it to them
5898976 my fathers films are really interested in challenging you and showing you things that you wouldnt see otherwise
5898977 hes not interested in telling you a particular story in his work there are many stories going on especially once you start moving into his nervous system projections where hes using multiple projectors or a strobe and trying to create three dimensional work without the glasses hes interested in pushing film toward an extreme of what it could be and maybe how it began how amazing it is to look and to see what it means to put light against dark
5898978 whenever i hear people say my work is challenging i say you know im making
5898979 thats a really private home they know that to the outside world it could be perceived as something crazy to allow me up there with a film crew and to allow the world to see it and now the movies going to play in a theater eight blocks away its incredibly generous i always draw on it as a testament of the difference between me and mikey the film is something mikey could never have done with his folks you know i feel that the film is proof of what our relationship is
5898980 i made the mistake yesterday of opening up one of those old boxes in my bedroom
5898981 i feel like i still cant understand time i cant understand that its been 15 years or 20 years i look at pictures and they still affect me i hope the film is not about nostalgia if you go back to these things if you actually remember your high school years theres as much pain and trauma as anything im not interested in nostalgia im just trying to understand how any film or a photograph or a song continues to be alive even after the people who made it are no longer living how is it possible that this kind of life can be contained
5898982 i should just try my best to keep doing things i care about
5898983 i looked up at joe strummer and said theres something here that i want i saw them communicating to a ton of people but really communicating people were really listening i was really being spoken to and really being respected my parents said i came back different and i did that energy from that memory has been enough for me to get to this point as an aim to shoot for
5898984 if we say wow you made a movie for 10 000
5898985 well to play with 10 000 when you dont come from money and you dont have money is an incredibly rich thing to do im going to play with my friends for the next two weeks and im going to spend 10 000 that sounds like an extravagant thing to me i try to hold onto that perspective mommas man was by far the most expensive situation ive ever been in and i know that in the real world that was supposedly a super low budget in fact it was the correct budget i like being contained i only shot about 17 1 2 hours of film but that was a good thing
5898986 look i dont feel that i know enough about film to create something that i would consider a perfect film
5898987 something like jarmuschs dead man where theres not a missed frame and it talks about everything i dont know enough about life or film to even try for that or la strada or playtime films that are flawless at least in my world thats not what im doing im just looking for accidents first and foremost im thinking about me sitting in the theater with my friends and family im just so excited that people are watching this stuff and taking it seriously and caring about it thats enough to ask for
5898988 we got wine and cheese and had a picnic on stalins foot
5898989 i remember thinking were cold war kids anyone over the age of 20 lived through the cold war and i think that name explains what this band is about we create backdrops where you can insert any kind of motif
5898990 we always had to look out for each other we split the rent and then we all went from being absolutely nothing to becoming a very successful band
5898991 but i dont think we ever really thought that dark means a million things
5898992 royce had this idea that the most beneficial thing you can do when youre living in a tribe or a city or a civilization is to stay loyal to the people around you
5898993 in a way he had a socialist perspective and its a very interesting time to think about how our country has fought against socialist things like universal health care for so long the group needs to pay attention to itself
5898994 but i decided to spring for it im totally thrilled about it i love vintage gear it was really expensive but nowadays were fortunate to have a little income going

5899028 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5899029 there were very violent battles that lasted several hours and an operation is still ongoing in the zone

5899042 concert this very contrast is the main reason why i thought that obama could win over some of those evangelical fence sitters whose world view and political ideology isnt completely grounded in roe v wade
5899043 so he couldnt hear the exact same questions that he was asking barack obama

5899057 the victorian and federal governments have not taken sufficient steps to ensure that vehicle safety in australia keeps pace with international developments

5899112 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5899113 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5899114 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5899115 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5899116 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5899117 she was really kind to me i didnt really talk to many of the people on bobby but lindsay and i got along really well then when they were struggling to find the character to play opposite her in i know who killed me lindsay suggested me i met with the producers and got the part it seemed to be a pretty good role and the cast was great but lindsay was going through a lot of personal things in the media and there was a lot of pressure on her shes a tremendous talent but she was very young and she was basically carrying this multi million movie ive got nothing bad to say about lindsay she helped me buy my house

5899145 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5899146 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5899147 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5899148 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5899149 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5899150 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5899151 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5899152 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5899153 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5899154 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5899155 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5899156 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5899157 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5899158 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5899159 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5899160 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5899161 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5899162 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5899163 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5899164 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5899165 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5899166 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5899167 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5899168 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5899169 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5899170 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5899171 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5899172 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5899173 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5899174 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5899175 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5899176 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5899177 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5899178 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5899179 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5899180 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5899181 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5899182 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5899183 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5899184 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5899185 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5899186 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5899187 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5899188 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5899189 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5899190 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
5899191 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
5899192 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5899193 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5899194 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5899195 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5899196 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5899197 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5899198 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5899199 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5899200 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5899201 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5899202 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5899203 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5899204 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5899205 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5899206 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5899207 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5899208 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5899209 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5899210 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5899211 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5899212 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5899213 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5899214 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5899215 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5899216 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5899217 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5899218 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5899219 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5899220 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5899221 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5899222 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5899223 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5899224 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5899225 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5899226 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5899227 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5899228 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5899229 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5899230 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5899231 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5899232 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5899233 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5899234 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5899235 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5899236 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5899237 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5899238 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5899239 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5899240 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5899241 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5899242 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5899243 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5899244 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5899245 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5899246 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5899247 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5899248 i got it back pretty quickly but from sunup to sundown i worked pretty hard at it
5899249 to shoot 65 to do it makes it that much better i feel really good about the way ive been playing
5899250 i had some moments of greatness mixed in with some pretty awful shots
5899251 that was the hard part im not saying that match play is easy but i just feel more comfortable knowing i can take a deep breath and validate my game
5899252 according to my estimates around 700 children have been killed in south ossetia during this war saakashvili is a monster i want to address him and say i want to strangle him with my bare hands for killing the young ones
5899253 we have evidence that georgians were high on drugs during the war that might explain why they were killing children senselessly
5899254 if every household in the united states replaced just one roll of virgin fiber toilet paper 500 sheets with 100 recycled ones we could save 423 900 trees
5899255 sleazy thrillers dont come much better than this tough and visceral offering
5899256 the heartfelt truthfulness of gardos tale and the performances of all leads particularly johansson make the film a powerful account of the universal search for identity and the meaning of
5899257 charms because of its natural non magical attitude toward humanity

5899320 this is going to sound weird but i like his mind set the most
5899321 he has a very open mind to learning hes very intelligent and thats something that is rarely talked about with pass rushers in this league
5899322 were looking for him to do even more he did some good natural things in the pass rush but now we want to see him sack the passer things like that
5899323 but hes come a long ways he really has now weve got to give him the opportunity to raise his level of production
5899324 rushing the passer its a chess game if you cant think if youre just a tall fast strong guy youre not going to get to the quarterback

5899344 we should award a gold medal to iraq because they have shown the olympic spirit they are true champions
5899345 we estimate what portion we are likely to bring in and base our budget on that we look at half the school roll and thats what we expect to get in
5899346 we have come not to rely on it if it comes in it is used to reduce deficit what we need to buy are things to run the school and well have them come hell or high water

5899361 our eight distributors cover only about half the country and there has been very little penetration of international markets so far
5899362 the penetration of the potential market is only about 2 percent
5899363 so with a market so large and penetration so small we figure our main challenge is just to go out and sell

5899372 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
5899373 when i worked at emory and you were on call i took students to the hospital because they binge drank and had to have charcoal to absorb the alcohol
5899374 in some regards its like okay lets wave the white flag and make it 18 and then were going to have the conversation about responsibility part of me thinks you can have those conversations about responsibility now
5899375 since 21 has become the law of the land about 25 thousand lives are estimated to be saved for our young people its not just an issue of drinking and driving its a public safety issue its a health issue
5899376 that 21 is a time when the human brain is developed to the point where it is the safest time to be consuming alcohol if you want to
5899377 i started off working in greek life and i used to work parties on fraternity row i can just imagine what thats going to be like now its going to be horrible so i think theyre going to create some additional problems if that happens
5899378 to be honest i found it difficult in marlborough and nelson to find anything tacky the comment is not meant to be derogatory its an interesting museum and i understand how much of a showpiece it is
5899379 its brilliantly run and operated by people who gave very good information
5899380 artsy dreadlocked wanderers mooch between cafes and coffee carts ducking into the bridge st bars or poetry readings in bookshops
5899381 i went through the town and checked out a few vineyards nearby but we have to put ourselves in the mindset of people visiting perhaps in the next edition richmond would be worth more attention
5899382 today we will experiment with a new form called the tandem story the process is simple each person will pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right as homework tonight one of you will write the first paragraph of a short story you will e mail your partner that paragraph and send another copy to me the partner will read the first paragraph and then add another paragraph to the story and send it back also sending another copy to me the first person will then add a third paragraph and so on back and forth remember to re read what has been written each time in order to keep the story coherent there is to be absolutely no talking outside of the e mails and anything you wish to say must be written in the e mail the story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached
5899383 why must one lose ones innocence to become a woman

5899385 paving ways for future cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy especially on electricity generation and water desalination
5899386 if indeed russia is interested in a middle east that is stable if indeed russia is interested in a middle east in which the kinds of activities that we have promoted together in the quartet russia the united states the european union and the united nations are going to have any chance then clearly its not going to be a middle east in which theres an iran with a nuclear weapon and i think thats why russia is involved in efforts to stop iran from violating the security council resolutions that have been passed
5899387 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran
5899388 the vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position
5899389 theyre not there yet and thats to be expected but this is a step forward that has implications strategically
5899390 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5899391 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5899392 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5899393 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5899394 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5899395 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5899396 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5899397 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5899398 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5899399 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5899400 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5899401 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5899402 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5899403 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5899404 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5899405 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5899406 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5899407 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5899408 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5899409 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5899410 this is a planning took where all things are going
5899411 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5899412 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5899413 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5899414 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5899415 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5899416 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5899417 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5899418 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5899419 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5899420 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5899421 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5899422 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5899423 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5899424 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5899425 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5899426 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5899427 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5899428 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5899429 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5899430 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5899431 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5899432 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5899433 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5899434 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5899435 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5899436 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5899437 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5899438 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5899439 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5899440 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5899441 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5899442 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5899443 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5899444 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5899445 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5899446 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5899447 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5899448 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5899449 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5899450 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5899451 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5899452 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5899453 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5899454 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5899455 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5899456 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5899457 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5899458 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5899459 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5899460 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5899461 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5899462 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5899463 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5899464 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5899465 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5899466 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5899467 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5899468 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5899469 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5899470 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5899471 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5899472 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5899473 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5899474 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5899475 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5899476 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5899477 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5899478 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5899479 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5899480 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5899481 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5899482 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5899483 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5899484 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5899485 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5899486 dear summer pt 1 full cdq tibs fav the hip hop heads should already be familiar with the atls stat quo who was a rapper i first
5899487 the olympic games serve as an apt metaphor and occur at an appropriate time to remind the nations educators and parents that we need to acknowledge this widespread problem and work harder to engage boys in reading
5899488 boys have trouble reading because they dont get to read for a purpose that makes any sense to them
5899489 as a society we need to make more of an effort to connect boys with many different kinds of reading both at home and at school
5899490 if we can expand the notion of what reading is well have a better chance of inspiring boys to want to be readers this means broadening our definition of reading to include boy friendly nonfiction humor sports comics graphic novels action adventure magazines websites and newspapers boys need to know that these materials count as reading
5899491 we can help boys become readers by giving them a reason to want to become readers
5899492 this approach opens the door and the mind once a boy starts reading he will be more receptive to many other types of reading over his lifetime

5899494 social networking sites such as facebook are a fast growing phenomenon mr hulls said in a statement
5899495 social network users need to realise that the information and photos they put into cyberspace in some cases can be seen by others and can leave a digital tattoo that can be difficult to erase
5899496 the latest research from the us suggests 44 per cent of employers are now using sites like myspace and facebook to research job candidates
5899497 as a general rule its best not to publish information you would not want the world to know he said
5899498 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5899499 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5899500 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5899501 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5899502 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5899503 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5899504 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5899505 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5899506 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5899507 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5899508 just leave me alone for 5 minutes yada yada yada
5899509 hes a knock off gordon la la la la la
5899510 these are clear indications of loss of hope in the peace process because what theyre seeing everyday are the anti moa sentiments
5899511 they are not giving the milf any other option but to go back to their original option so whats the implication of this imagine if the war escalates not just north cotabato not just lanao norte but all of mindanao
5899512 i think its a political statement by the milf kolambugan used to be one of their first lines of defense in the 1974 75 war there used to be a big force of ilagas if you remember the war then the ilagas had managed to defend kolambugan so well and demilitarized after that
5899513 and what the milf has done is to show that it can still attack kolambugan and prove it can operate everywhere
5899514 my sense is that he is against it peace talks and the only problem is to be able to show that he is still a force to reckon with inside the organization somebody who has to be attended to
5899515 we filed the intervention because we wanted to impress upon the public that there is a constituency that supports the peace process as of now the public has only been reading and hearing the views of the anti moas we also filed it to set the historical antecedents of the moa of the grp milf peace process and of the mindanao conflict itself
5899516 the grp milf peace process has already taken twelve years this was marked by two all out military offensives in years 2000 and 2003 and countless major outbreaks of fighting which produced almost one million and 430 000 refugees respectively and thousands of homes ruined human casualties combatants and non combatants are indeterminate
5899517 the four decade long mindanao conflict is one of the most serious yet under reported conflicts in the world
5899518 ironic because this is a conflict of darfur and timorese proportions it has already cost more than 100 000 lives and millions of internally displaced persons
5899519 agreements and consensus points that would have led to an early successful conclusion of the talks have also been set aside due to pressure from conservatives and hawks
5899520 the grp milf talks are only the latest of numerous attempts to peacefully resolve by way of negotiations what is now the longest running armed conflict in asia but precisely because past efforts have failed this latest one may turn out to be the last one should it fail
5899521 time will come when even the peace groups even civil society will lose hope believe me i spend a lot of time there
5899522 it was a political statement if they really wanted to destroy the town they could have done more damage when they had full control from 10 am to 3 pm
5899523 this can of worms has also regurgitated another unsavory reality that has been with us ever since our forefathers fought the spaniards and their indio factotums servants the anti moro attitude of the filipinos we are aghast at the way filipino politicians whether in and out of government and with the help of the media have whipped up an anti moro anti muslim hysteria that has swept the whole country it is simply nauseating to see and hear on radio and tv these politicians blatantly and publicly distort the moa ad and turn it into propaganda to demonize the milf the bangsamoro people and islam
5899524 the moros will fight milf base commander ustadz amirul ombra cato will not be alone a war in mindanao will drag down this pathetic artificial country and its government to perdition perhaps this time we will no longer settle for a sub state or a federative arrangement with the filipinos its useless anyway because they would never grant it they would always insist this is secession even if we do not have the intention to secede so lets give them a dose of their own medicine lets aim for independence this time
5899525 they grp should do the final signing of the moa ad one word is enough for a wise man wheres justice it is they who did not keep their word
5899526 i think weve matured in the past five to ten years maybe in another five to ten years we can hope to achieve things that are currently available in singapore or thailand where the awareness is much higher
5899527 gabby i really enjoy the time weve spent together but it is obvious to me that we are in different places in our lives and we want different things out of a relationship and i respect myself too much to let you continue to treat me this way
5899528 boris johnson has realised that as elected mayor he must take more of a central decision making role rather than delegating his responsibilities to his deputies
5899529 a car backfired and he just hit the sidewalk so fast i didnt know what was going on with him but i figured it had to do with vietnam
5899530 started putting two and two together about these vets that came back these guys would start partying friday night and not go home to their families until monday night they just drank to excess to blot it all out
5899531 if these people can meet me even if its just for coffee for an information interview thats great
5899532 you see physical psychological sexual and financial abuse because the stress is phenomenal
5899533 these men and women are coming and going and theyre leaving their kids and these kids dont know if their parents are going to come back
5899534 they take everything personally they see their dad or mom coming and going and they hear these things about the war and theyre probably set up for anxiety disorder
5899535 it affects their school work it affects their future relationships their ability to make relationships
5899536 the kids have got to be suffering they might start using alcohol or drugs and they dont know why so it would be good for them to come in
5899537 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5899538 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5899539 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
5899540 some spectres have been known to long for physical contact with the living in ways most unhealthy or inappropriate
5899541 i have also written heartwarming books where people return from the dead usually to eat the living its true but surely that is a quibble
5899542 i do however like to kick them when im bored
5899543 i can say with all of my heart that i love my animals
5899544 its about 16 miles round trip to work and fortunately my car gets good gas mileage but its getting to a point where i may have to start looking at changing my driving habits
5899545 i have had to cut back on some things and make changes in the way i live in order to keep up with everything
5899546 the baby boomers are a huge group and i wonder whether the system is going to be able to hold up under that strain
5899547 but right now i worry a lot more about making it from day to day than i do about social security which is a few years down the road
5899548 the main thing for england is you need players who can play under pressure and do it under the spotlight because you know there is a lot of criticism waiting from the public
5899549 youve got to deal with that that is the hardest obstacle we are going to get over as a team playing under that intense pressure
5899550 some players can do it better than others that is just how it is we need england to get over that psychological barrier its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence
5899551 playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things international football is different
5899552 i wouldnt say any one player lacks confidence we need to improve our mentality as a team
5899553 we are doing that and we are trying to play and get the ball down we need to stay cool and calm
5899554 pero lo que sucede es que el sol no es una bola de fuego sino que en realidad es un gigantesco reactor nuclear donde se da una reaccion de fision nuclear es decir la union de dos atomos peque os hidrogeno en uno mas grande helio y este tipo de reacciones no necesita de oxigeno para llevarse a cabo las filipinas yahoo
5899555 allowed more than 10 000 people with criminal histories including bank robbers racketeers defrauders embezzlers identity thieves and tax evaders among others to work in floridas mortgage lending industry between 2000 and 2007 these convicted felons had expropriated more than 85 million from lenders and homeowners during that time
5899556 of course we want to win but we werent concerned with winning and losing at the expense of seeing everyone play
5899557 we have an opportunity now to study video and work with our team about mistakes and things we can improve on the result although disappointing is something we can live with if we played our starters it might have been a different
5899558 if you watched the game you saw that we were in their end of the field probably 80 percent of the second half
5899559 you get punished when you dont finish your chances certainly we werent sharp enough in the attack tonight to finish if we had put a couple goals away i dont know if they would have got one but it was 0 0 and they were still in the game
5899560 we definitely had more attacking movements they scored a late goal on the run of play and that happens in soccer the result doesnt concern me too much as long as we come back and work hard

5899581 it doesnt take a harvard mathematician to deduce this one builders are competing for sales with the massive supply of foreclosed homes as well as with home owners in good standing with banks who are trying to sell their homes
5899582 right now there isnt a catalyst to jump begin sales or the economy and its a major concern the housing sector is suffering from both the rise in foreclosures during 2007 2008 and a classic overbuild that typically occurs during housing booms in this particular cycle the overbuild was really high in florida california and parts of the southwest u s
5899583 late 2009 if we are lucky but theres only a 10 15 chance of that more than likely the housing slump continues well into 2010

5899588 a person of substance would have presented himself to his fellow leaders among the pacific island countries to account for the undertaking he gave to them
5899589 what he has done is chicken out of that and i dont think that the leaders across the region will respond to that positively
5899590 the challenge for pacific countries is to have a united front on the question of fiji and to apply maximum political and diplomatic leverage on bainimaramas regime
5899591 i use the word regime because its not a democratically elected government and were not accustomed not to have democratically elected governments

5899598 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
5899599 we believe that the year long celebration justifies the expenditure of funds requested on the basis of tourism expenditures during the year
5899600 as well as economic and industrial development exposure on a national and international scale
5899601 very conservative and have been determined in accordance with historical data and tourism development authority practice
5899602 the actual economic benefit of the pepsi 100th celebration which included only three weekends of events was 4 473 000
5899603 what is the city going to do with this quarter million dollars they cant have a parade every day
5899604 i do think every dime we spend we will get back but we are spending taxpayers dollars
5899605 the issue is not whether year round calendars are good or bad or whether traditional calendars are good or bad
5899606 the issue is the potential for an added hardship if a parent has children on two or more tracks
5899607 but when the question is open its almost like a mandate you cant do anything
5899608 sending out a survey about a calendar we dont know if we can change gives a false hope or a false distress were waiting to get a supreme court answer the guess is that they will confirm the appeals ruling
5899609 monsters do exist in us and among us they walk in our shadow they can prey on us more as we fear them less we should know we created them
5899610 hes still limited and again weve said we will be daya to day with him very cautious about what we do we know hamstrings can take some time but we said all along it would be day to day steady progress with him and i thought for what he did yesterday he did pretty good
5899611 he had a good scrimmage the other day was very solid for us
5899612 than what we anticipated again his sitaiutoin is very similar to
5899613 they want me to do everything im doing to be pain free and that was the case yesterday
5899614 i feel like i could but its not necessary at this point he said
5899615 i dont want to do anything thats going to possibly re injure it or push me back any so when i feel comfortable with it i will push it all out if thats saturday the 30th then thats what it will be

5899659 recent trading for the australian casino businesses has been satisfactory with total revenue excluding vip commission based play to 14 august up four per cent on last year
5899660 year on year growth in vip commission program play has been strong over the same period
5899661 the past year has been one of significant activity with the most important event being the separation of crown and pbl into two separately listed companies
5899662 this result was achieved despite the introduction of full smoking bans in bars on the main gaming floor and an increase in the victorian gaming machine levy during the year
5899663 crown melbourne and burswood further cemented their leadership position in the australian casino industry
5899664 mpel is on track to open city of dreams in the first half of 2009
5899665 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5899666 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5899667 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves

5899685 mortgage choice is confident that it is well placed to achieve another successful year in fiscal 2009

5899687 for us queensland and victoria outperformed the larger new south wales market in this reporting period

5899706 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5899707 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5899708 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5899709 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5899710 i understand another rumor is flying out there last week it was running back controversy in miami
5899711 the maitred in miami asked almost condescendingly as he then scanned the floor of tables for two four and more all mostly without customers and spotted one in a dark corner surely the deuces and four tops would arrive later and be real business it was a feh fay 6

5899720 as i was on my way home from south carolina last thursday night i got
5899721 i might be speaking against something that god is actually doing
5899722 did i sit on the sidelines while the playing field burned
5899723 we dont really have a lot of good options at this point
5899724 i think surprising myself then has sort of shown me that i always have to expect the highest level from myself
5899725 now that im here i see what a big deal this is
5899726 its just like any other race only its not at all like any other race
5899727 its been really interesting watching the games from korea because you see a whole different side they show all the sports theyre good at its been pretty surreal kind of weird
5899728 it sort of hit me going through security to get into the olympic village and getting the accreditation and everything its like whoa were really here
5899729 my fitness was really good my confidence was really good and then i had to settle for getting top 15s at world cups it was kind of a bummer of all the years it had to happen it had to happen this year but finally now i feel like im back to my normal self back to feeling 100 percent now
5899730 i hope you cant sleep and you dream about it
5899731 we never went out during the time we were training
5899732 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5899733 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well through hard training and strict discipline
5899734 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5899735 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in two months
5899736 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5899737 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5899738 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5899739 they go from pastel blue to olive drab theyre unique we dont have to color eggs at easter
5899740 because when you go at her she grabs on and twists until you shout
5899741 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5899742 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
5899743 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones
5899744 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than two years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5899745 i mean the last thing you want to do is accommodate one guy and screw up four i dont know what their reasons are i didnt ask and i didnt care im just glad to be here and im glad they gave me a day to pitch which is friday
5899746 well put him in friday hell be pitching every five days from there
5899747 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5899748 great the guys got a lot to offer a hall of famer
5899749 hes a lot smarter than a lot of people smarter than anyone ive ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned
5899750 the thing about greg he keeps everything so simple people like to make things more complicated than they need to be you learn a lot the way he approaches the game
5899751 weve had people in the ballpark his last three starts
5899752 hes pitched very well hes got a chance to give us quality every time he goes out there he know how to pitch he knows how to attack a hitter
5899753 de acuerdo con las estimaciones que se hicieron seg n las cotizaciones de sus acciones en la bolsa de valores de caracas el total no llegar a a 400 millones de d lares
5899754 no est n modernizadas y tienen problemas que van a requerir inversiones adicionales
5899755 i liked his ability to drop with some urgency i liked his ability to throw the ball with velocity but obviously he still has a ways to go im glad were not playing tomorrow
5899756 if hes healthy he gives us the best opportunity to go win
5899757 im not trying to make it so we cant make progress
5899758 im trying to keep it hard on the quarterbacks and keep it realistic
5899759 some guys are going to get beat and some guys will come free
5899760 the quarterbacks have to have the ability to throw the football away run make plays with their legs
5899761 neither one of those things can really stop him from playing in the opener but we need to let it heal
5899762 he needs to get some work and get things down
5899763 in fact we would still have the toughest scheme in the world because even the european union only proposes to auction 20 per cent of its permits in the ninth year of its schemes operation
5899764 auctioning only 20 per cent of permits would repeat the big mistake made by the european union when they started which was to give away permits allowing the big polluters to take windfall gains by passing on the carbon price for which they were already being fully compensated
5899765 its tough when you hear people say things about you
5899766 hes got a savvy about him like hes a real veteran player
5899767 anytime there is missing information opinion turns into speculation and speculation turns into rumor
5899768 when coach went there it was a big deciding factor
5899769 my whole thing was lets get the football to darren mcfadden at least 30 times a game
5899770 both of those guys went through some very tough times
5899771 we just talked about the things that were happening and what was best for them
5899772 there were times when it hurt him deeply to see the same fans who had praised him three months earlier suddenly turn their backs on him
5899773 they didnt throw much and i was sitting there thinking maybe this isnt the place for me
5899774 i knew at that point i needed to be there
5899775 you throw the ball and hell find a way to come down with it
5899776 hes intelligent which i think really helps him hes able to see things and make things happen
5899777 no es solo con mayor c rcel que se solucionan los problemas de agresividad y violencia sino con la solidaridad y la compasi n
5899778 in order to swift boat john mccain you will need his fellow pows to come out and say he is bloviating etc swift boating means someone who was there who knows you are full of hot air is on your tail not i repeat not what the left wants it to mean the only way john mccain can be swift boated is if someone who was there with him causes mccains campaign to scramble to answer the allegations otherwise this is desperation by the left who sees their guaranteed win slipping away
5899779 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
5899780 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
5899781 youve got to react and thats part of playing the position and its part of being a good offense
5899782 i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before it is just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
5899783 some of the practices that he hasnt participated in are still things that he has done before not new things
5899784 but to the extent if there are new things and the player misses those then we will need to catch him up on it because the rest of the team has got it
5899785 any time you can get into game situations and get out there and be in game speed its great for the development process
5899786 the more you do it obviously the more comfortable you become
5899787 hes always very supportive and points out things that he thinks that i could get better on and also points out the things that i did really well
5899788 it doesnt matter to me what people say on the outside all that matters is whats going on internally and how im doing
5899789 i feel like im making a lot of progress and i feel like i know the offense and i feel like i can go out and execute the offense
5899790 predominately its the miners dragging us up and the banks still lagging
5899791 in the last couple of days weve had both the resources and the banks giving us grief but today weve got the resource stocks bouncing quite sharply
5899792 bhp after its good profit got slaughtered yesterday but today after the bounce in commodity prices its up
5899793 it doesnt seem to make sense that you would include in the tax hybrid vehicles and green vehicles that are ultra fuel efficient he told abc radio today

5899798 both mccain and obama have virtually the same ratios in hard name id and are liked nearly equally by the voters for obama he is viewed favorably by 46 of voters compared to 32 who have an unfavorable opinion 22 have no opinion of him for mccain 44 view him favorably compared to 34 who view him unfavorably and 22 who have no opinion this again reflects the closeness of the race since neither candidate has succeeded in developing a positive image that is head and shoulders above the other
5899799 what the growers are finding is reluctance in the marketplace orders arent as large
5899800 its slow now because everybody is scared they say salmonella is now i say no no the tomatoes come from california now in the u s
5899801 i think it was an overreaction theyve done this before with other vegetables and it ended up not being what they thought it was unfortunately it was an economic hardship for these people because people react without checking out the facts thats a shame

5899842 it is only now that the nation realises the critical importance of gas to the national economy
5899843 you were made and set here to give voice to this your own astonishment
5899844 she was going to be a doctor and i was going to be a lawyer and we would live happily ever after
5899845 i think you have to have a coach who really embraces the role i dont think it can be a situation where its a coach who is just ego driven for his sport
5899846 theres no one who can do it better than derek dooley i have a lot of confidence in him he has an awful lot of talent and dedication
5899847 a university president always takes chances i dont think im taking a chance with derek dooley i honestly believe this is the best thing for our program
5899848 i think the reasons you dont find that as much is the role of an athletics director has grown tremendously in the last 10 years
5899849 the complication and the excitement of television and communication and the burden of the budget i just dont think you will find many dereks anymore
5899850 getting the right assistants is the whole thing i was fortunate because i had good help on both sides of the ball coaching and administration but i had been around long enough to where i had established a good staff
5899851 what i cant do is get caught up in a lot of issues that can get resolved at bruces level
5899852 i know whats going to happen if i dont do well in football people are going to say well hes too spread out or whatever
5899853 i dont think that will be the case if i dont get it done in football it will be for other reasons you cant be scared to put it on the line
5899854 youre offered a job you just go down that track
5899855 they teach him to argue in law school and he was on the debate team and i lost that argument in five seconds
5899856 it was philosophy intangibles it was game ebb and flow game management media it was all those things from the top down some guys are the other way they are good at xs and os but not the big picture
5899857 i told derek that his wife has to be totally on board because it will never work if its just him
5899858 hes very capable of doing both its just at what point in time is he going to be satisfied as a football coach and then go into administration
5899859 im going to keep doing it the same way try to do the best you can and see where it takes you
5899860 the important first step for the international cricket council was gaining recognition of the sport and of the council from the ioc
5899861 that is important particularly for many of our smaller nations because to belong to a sporting body that has recognition from the ioc improves their opportunity for funding
5899862 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
5899863 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport
5899864 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasise the international cricket council has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position
5899865 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
5899866 he certainly hasnt either i understand the urgency if it was a regular season game but were treating it as if it was a regular season game i want to see how far he can come in that period of time
5899867 its like a part of your leg it will be a thing he could play out of too most of those guys dont like to be braced at the end of the day
5899868 we really dont hold back anything depending on what quarterback it is
5899869 in fact we had a plan in place where wed play the first team guys through the half and we were talking about the fact that gus needed some snaps with the first team
5899870 i know its easy for me to say after tarvaris gets hurt but frerotte needed some snaps as opposed to having the second team offensive line and the second team wide receivers to throw to so we actually were going to bring him out after the half with the starters in this game perhaps hell get a chance to start well just have to see
5899871 hes had about every test that we know of and the doctors know of
5899872 its just hes uncomfortable with sticking the foot in the ground and breaking straight ahead stuff is ok its not a deal where two weeks rest has made the difference we feel like were treating it right its just a matter of it settling down everybody heals different
5899873 its tender so hes mixing the treatment with the football and doing what he can do

5899877 uno tiene que seguirse m s y m s no hay que descansar de lograr cosas y ojal lo pueda conseguir porque se quiere tener m s cosas para uno y el equipo
5899878 creo que esos goles dan confianza sin duda alguna para uno como delantero y como siempre lo he dicho los que valen son los de la liga
5899879 as que esperemos que podamos seguir por esa racha m s que todo lo principal es que el equipo gane no importa qui n meta los goles pero uno como delantero tiene que tener en la mente el gol
5899880 lo normal por ah nos sent amos extra os porque no jugamos este fin de semana pero ya entrenamos con normalidad creo que hay que seguir con esa misma personalidad en los trabajos para ir por el triunfo
5899881 creo que el profe ha estado trabajando muy bien entonces lo que hacemos en la semana hacerlo el d a s bado contra san luis que va a ser un partido muy dif cil
5899882 creo que hay que tener respeto dentro de la cancha hay que tenerlo pero igual creo que dentro de la cancha el respeto no vale as que hay que faltarle el respeto
5899883 vela sufri fatiga muscular y no entren al cien por ciento

5899889 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5899890 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5899891 the important thing here is an adherence to the undertakings that russia has signed onto
5899892 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5899893 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces
5899894 todos debemos de sentirnos muy orgullosos son guerreros que est n listos para aportar tenemos cinco jugadores que representan el esp ritu de la laguna y que sin lugar a dudas van a dejar huella en la selecci n
5899895 de entrada es una semana de nueve puntos y en septiembre y octubre vienen seis semanas de jornadas dobles continuas de convocados a la selecci n tambi n y estamos prepar ndonos para enfrentarlo
5899896 ha sido un a o muy irregular para nosotros por las lesiones en t rminos de seleccionados tambi n pero estamos muy claros en el reto que tenemos de enfrentar estos dos torneos y estamos preparados junto con esta gran afici n que es nuestra fortaleza y es la que nos llena el esp ritu y el coraz n para seguir adelante
5899897 creo que por ah s se tienen maneras similares de jugar creo que las caracter sticas de los jugadores de ellos por ah es diferente creo que va a ser un partido interesante y vamos a ir con la idea de traernos el resultados
5899898 sabemos que es un equipo muy bien armado es un equipo que tiene muchos a os jugando junto es un gran equipo y creo que para nosotros es un buen reto que llega en un buen momento y sirve por la manera que venimos haciendo las cosas nosotros
5899899 ser a muy importante para nosotros conseguir un buen resultado y seguir aumentando la confianza
5899900 creo que hay que seguir de la misma manera que lo hemos hecho el mismo orden el mismo sacrificio la misma humildad dentro de la cancha y creo que esas cosas son claves
5899901 es importante tener un orden creo que parte todo de ah y creo que nosotros lo estamos teniendo tambi n aprendimos o el equipo madur sabe c mo y cu ndo atacar cu ndo replegarse atr s creo que el equipo est un poco o mucho m s maduro en esos detalles creo que es fundamental para el funcionamiento del equipo
5899902 es un momento lindo el que estamos viviendo pero como ya hab amos dicho y como pensamos todos de la misma manera creo que esto reci n empieza y para hacerlo tan real creo que hay que seguir por este camino
5899903 tenemos que pensar que el mejor camino para llegar a los objetivos que nos trazamos es ste el seguir sumando y el jugar de la misma manera fuera y dentro
5899904 todos los partidos son diferentes a veces se puede desesperar m s al rival a veces se le puede desesperar un poco depende
5899905 history despite its wrenching pain cannot be unlived but if faced with courage need not be lived again
5899906 me siento muy a gusto regres a tecos con muchas ganas y agradecido con la invitaci n que me hicieron afortunadamente todo se ha dado de la mejor manera y esperamos que todos sigamos en el mismo nivel porque por ah tenemos la responsabilidad de sacar al equipo de esta situaci n del descenso pero no solamente apuntar en eso porque tambi n pensamos en la liguilla
5899907 s es la realidad de tecos por qu no si hemos sacado esa cantidad de puntos es porque lo hemos merecido y no recuerdo que en los primeros tres partidos nos hayan regalado nada tuvimos que trabajar los tres partidos sufrir y esforzarnos y eso nos ha redituado en los resultados
5899908 yo estoy trabajando al m ximo haciendo todo lo que me pidan
5899909 yo estoy trabajando al m ximo haciendo todo lo que me pidan y despu s el t cnico para algo est y l decidir si me dar la posibilidad yo lo que pienso es que a la hora de entrenar lo hago por el bien m o y no para el bien de l trejo ni del preparador f sico lo importante ac es tener la cabeza fr a decir las cosas como son y tirar para adelante al grupo para que sigamos bien
5899910 nunca me pas algo similar pero claro que desespera y en estas situaciones hay que tener los huevos bien puestos para aguantar lo que venga lo que te manden a hacer y callarte la boca y despu s el tiempo dir a ver qu pasa
5899911 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
5899912 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5899913 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5899914 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves

5899961 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5899962 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5899963 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore

5899989 now that all this time has passed whats left is whats real
5899990 the last time i did that was several weeks ago its not so bad now things are under control
5899991 it started when i was 15 i was stressed out over my exams i felt such a release the first time i forced myself to vomit that i kept doing it id eat and then throw up at first i only did it once every few days but it got so bad at one stage that i was doing it a few times a day

5899996 carved upon my bones and flesh it has become a part of me
5899997 being in a society that idolises thin girls was hard i had issues with my weight i was constantly told that i had gained weight and it was sometimes made into cruel jokes that were not funny at all
5899998 soon i began to loathe myself no one seemed to be able to accept me as i was they wanted a more perfect me throwing up after i ate helped to cancel out the calories i consumed a perfect solution
5899999 one night i made myself binge and then purged so many times that i found it difficult to breathe and my chest started to hurt when i went back to my room i knew this was rock bottom or maybe lower
