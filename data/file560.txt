5600000 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5600001 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5600002 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5600003 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5600004 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5600005 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5600006 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5600007 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5600008 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5600009 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5600010 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5600011 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5600012 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5600013 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5600014 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5600015 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5600016 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5600017 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5600018 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5600019 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5600020 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5600021 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5600022 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5600023 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5600024 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5600025 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5600026 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5600027 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5600028 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5600029 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5600030 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5600031 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5600032 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5600033 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5600034 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5600035 who are open to doing something on the production side
5600036 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5600037 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5600038 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5600039 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5600040 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5600041 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5600042 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5600043 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5600044 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5600045 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5600046 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5600047 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5600048 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5600049 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5600050 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5600051 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5600052 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5600053 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5600054 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5600055 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5600056 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5600057 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5600058 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5600059 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5600060 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5600061 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5600062 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5600063 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5600064 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over
5600065 thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things about baseball i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5600066 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
5600067 if its surgery then im out eight weeks and im done for the season
5600068 you can be frustrated with the situation and when you do that youre not focusing on the task at hand as of right now im a triple a baseball player i need to focus on what im doing down here
5600069 i hope im still playing the game when hes old enough to understand the game and he can see his dad play
5600070 id like to be in the big leagues with the mariners but you never know what could happen
5600071 there will be an opportunity for him down the line and hes just got to be ready for it whether its with us or somebody else
5600072 he hasnt been down about anything and hes done what he needs to do go out and swing the bat and be solid behind the plate and hell get his chance
5600073 i have an opportunity to go out there and hopefully win a championship and have that last part of my dream fulfilled
5600074 playing with my dad ninety five going out there and playing with jay
5600075 i think i only know one or two guys on the team now
5600076 but seeing them mariners does bring back some memories of what it was like over there
5600077 i get a couple of texts here and there voice mail
5600078 its demoralizing to continue to get beat but its also encouraging to see the progress weve made offensively the last month
5600079 probably the roughest coach ive ever had too all in the love of his son
5600080 im not so anxious up there im not so anxious on the first pitch im staying relaxed and im getting more good pitches to hit
5600081 the best hitter was probably two edgar martinez being one and barry bonds being the other
5600082 there was nothing edgar couldnt hit youd try to jam him one time and hed shoot it to right field youd do it again and hed pull it down the left field line you just didnt know what he would do with the bat plus he had short arms you couldnt really jam him
5600083 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
5600084 theres been nothing noticeably different other than maybe sharpness and location really with his stuff the question is is he on the black or on the plate
5600085 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5600086 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5600087 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5600088 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5600089 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5600090 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5600091 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5600092 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5600093 hopefully being in the olympics will bring bmx out of the little kid stage because everyone thinks its just a kiddie sport with little kiddie bikes
5600094 if youre in the olympics youre an athlete at the top of your sport
5600095 hes just as crazy off the track as he is on it

5600098 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5600099 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
5600100 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
5600101 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
5600102 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
5600103 that would be a separate league that would be nba affiliated or nba sponsored but it would be independent
5600104 and it would just sign players for a very long time to come it would be at a lower scale than the nba but as the sport develops in china and as more players around the world recognize the opportunities of playing in china we see that league growing and strengthening
5600105 i think that that is likely to become a regular thing
5600106 coming out of athens there was just more of a focus at every level on the game and the representation of ones country and were just doing a better job collectively on that front
5600107 hopefully being in the olympics will bring bmx out of the little kid stage because everyone thinks its just a kiddie sport with little kiddie bikes

5600125 bis ende des jahres wird es neumannpartners in singapur geben und 2009 etablieren wir unsere pr senz in indien
5600126 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5600127 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5600128 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5600129 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5600130 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5600131 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5600132 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5600133 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

5600142 i am intrigued by the people s behaviour and gestures which are different from those seen in korea when i saw people dance in fukuoka i was thrilled to find that their particular way of thinking was reflected in their behaviour i wanted to capture that feeling in the photographs and that was the start of my work
5600143 dance is quite interesting when seen through the viewfinder the dancers facial expressions and body movements reveal their lifestyles dance is between two people and through dance people can communicate their mutual feelings without words

5600237 it was not a big mistake but it his score was not enough to get a medal
5600238 its the first time ive made this mistake but you know theres always a first time
5600239 i think its fun the chinese fans appreciate what we do and understand what were doing it makes us feel welcome and it makes us excited to compete for that crowd
5600240 when the fans see a big degree of difficulty posted on the board you hear a rumble go through the crowd because they know a big dive is coming
5600241 ive won and ive lost nothing will surprise me ive experienced both making great memories along the way is what you take with you
5600242 if michael phelps can win eight gold medals then why cant usa win softball
5600243 this is what the olympics is about having extraordinary performances and making the viewers on tv watching us get chills
5600244 if we can do that every game then thats success for softball
5600245 es ist ja bekannt dass wir mittlerweile auch in mittelzentren expandieren
5600246 we put together a more complete ball game today with outstanding pitching
5600247 we had a little more showing from our hitters and scored some runs early you have to score some runs in international baseball and that is something that we struggled with
5600248 and if that requires segregation well then we have got to segregate the child in the best interests of that child
5600249 they need proper english language training but my view is at the moment thats not happening i know my views are controversial but the bottom line is that i have only the interest of the new irish at heart
5600250 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit
5600251 im completely totally devastated and the thing that hurts me most is that i wasnt there when she went to heaven
5600252 it wasnt anything criminal on anybodys part the dog lunged at the girl and tragic circumstances resulted
5600253 the 20 year old on all appearances was taking good care of the two children that were there there was no malice or anything done on her part to cause the dog to do this
5600254 i knew that sooner or later something was going to happen it was inevitable
5600255 im not going to defend the dog in any way shape or form for what he did to my child but at the same time my grandmother is not around my children enough to know exactly what is going on
5600256 pit bulls can make wonderful pets theyre no more likely to bite than many other dogs
5600257 this is definitely a very tragic situation and you hate to see this kind of thing happen this isnt something that anyone expects
5600258 the idea is to get energy relief money as well as the permanent fund dividend before winter hits so people have their money to offset the astronomical costs we are seeing for energy
5600259 it would be disingenuous to pretend you dont sense corruption
5600260 they went right back into negotiations with the owners to get a better deal which they did
5600261 ive never seen an appraisal and we were never presented with one
5600262 when the staff did the arithmetic they thought gee this is a perfect classic beautiful spot itll probably be 100 percent filled every day and it wasnt
5600263 the first few months people would just not know how to access it
5600264 i want us to raise the threshold of access to basic social services in the remote less well off inaccessible llgs like waria buang watut wau rural and mumeng to the levels enjoyed and taken for granted by bulolo wau urban also i would like to see all llgs to move forward together to participate in and benefit from economic activities in the district
5600265 the plan recognizes that ultimately the raising of living standards of the people remain in their own hands however the inspiration motivation and opportunities as well as the basic infrastructure to have them engage in economic activities towards the end must be kick started by political and bureaucratic leadership
5600266 coming in here there was so much more to it than i thought thered be its been a long two year journey
5600267 kyle is probably one of the most athletic people ive ever seen in anything
5600268 we can be playing basketball and hes dunking over people that transfers into route running ability hes explosive
5600269 from last year this time to this year this time its night and day
5600270 theyre in a position where they can start to contribute
5600271 coach huff did a great job getting him to buy into changing his mentality
5600272 by the time i got here he had already decided he wanted to be a physical player i still think he runs well and is a big target but he has a chance to do more on the line of scrimmage than we anticipated
5600273 the first few days of camp i kind of felt a little heavy on my feet
5600274 im still not good at it but ive been getting better
5600275 im going to take advantage of those few shots im going to get
5600276 it was pretty incredible we knew we would get a ton of gear but had no idea we got bags and bags full of amazing gear
5600277 i was extremely excited to meet lebron james and he was really nice too
5600278 they have to follow you but sometimes they have a little trouble keeping up especially on hills
5600279 they do everything to stay with us and theyll be in good shape sometimes theyre just beat but dalian is great and the people here really embraced the american team
5600280 here i am getting word on campus that he wants to quit and just be a frat boy
5600281 i got him out of that fraternity and told him he was far from being done i let him know that the talent i saw wasnt what kids in the fraternity had his talent doesnt belong in a frat i knew that he could be an olympian
5600282 back then i was still a 1 49 guy i recall coming off surgery and i didnt know whether i wanted to keep running
5600283 sam dragged me out of my fraternity and said i had too much potential to throw it all away i wasnt sure i wanted to keep running but he probably saved my career
5600284 the biggest thing for me was learning to love the sport again
5600285 was this really what i wanted to be doing ultimately talking with bishop kelly cross country and track coach tom shanahan and people in boise it helped me realize how much i love the sport how much it gives back to me and how much it offers me to give back to others
5600286 he comes from a great family and his support in boise is huge thats given him the wings to stretch out and do what hes done so far
5600287 at that point i think he got the bug back
5600288 since that day his priorities have been all about being the best 800 runner in the world
5600289 we trained really hard back in eugene i obviously wont know until i run that first race but i feel good and my legs are back under me after it took a little time to adjust to the time change and travel
5600290 i wasnt expected to win two national championships as a freshman at willamette i wasnt supposed to win the prefontaine classic in 2007 and a lot of people didnt think id win the trials my job right now is just to get through the prelims only eight will make the finals and once youre there its anyones game i feel like i belong in the finals and i know i am capable
5600291 you saw that kick and no one was with him if someone could have gone with him hes going 1 43 low in that race but the beautiful thing about nick is hes not about time hes all about winning races thats beautiful that is pure track and field
5600292 the bush administration stayed too closely aligned with him for too long when it was clear that the people of pakistani said they want change and the us was being seen as an obstacle to pakistans legitimate democratic aspirations
5600293 we should not have been on that side of the debate somehow we lost our moorings by not recognizing that emergency rule crackdowns on civil society putting lawyers in jail beginning to have a heavy hand with the press was and should have been an anathema to the united states
5600294 the bush administration clearly felt that musharraf was essential to the war on terrorism and failed to recognize that for the people of pakistan the war on terrorism was seen as bushs war and was not being supported by the pakistani people which if its going to successful in the long run the people of pakistan are going to have to be behind it and the government of pakistan
5600295 that wasnt the case at all most of us believe that musharraf was playing a double game and that he was cooperating with the united states when it was convenient for him to do so and to the extent it was convenient
5600296 but he was never genuinely in the war on terror or the war against the extremists and we have a thousand different pieces of evidence to support that
5600297 so one worries about the war on terrorism only if one believes that musharraf was a stalwart ally in that war and he wasnt
5600298 first of all the pakistani people abandoned him and they had every right to do so and secondly no one except perhaps musharraf and his closes supporters is prepared to argue that the us should have stayed with a leader when that leaders own people wanted him to go
5600299 musharraf a long time ago had lost his authority and his legitimacy we were late in recognizing how badly his position had eroded
5600300 i wish we had divorced ourselves from him far sooner than we actually had so rather than abandoning him i mean if anything we are johnny comes lately on this
5600301 the army had evidently concluded that it did not want to face either an impeachment process regardless of outcome or the popular disturbances that would have resulted if musharraf decided to use his power to dissolve parliament and dismiss the government these were the key factors that led musharraf to resign
5600302 the us administration evidently concluded that in these circumstances musharraf had effectively lost power which led to the statement last week by the bush administration that impeachment was an internal pakistan matter
5600303 internal insurgency in pakistan and they still face the challenge of mutual mistrust and will have to work even harder to overcome that since their common enemy musharraf is not in office anymore
5600304 i would like to look at this in optimistic terms although the record of the new civilian government in pakistan since february doesnt give one a great deal of confidence that they will get their act together but looking at this in an optimistic way the resolution of the wither musharraf issue and putting that behind should allow the civilian government an opportunity to now focus on the real threats facing the country including the threat of extremism and the militants in the tribal areas that are placing pakistan at risk
5600305 because of the continuous infighting and disagreements about how to deal with musharraf how to deal with the restoring of the judiciary these bigger issues havent gotten addressed and the musharraf departure may give them an opportunity to start focusing on these issues of immediate concern
5600306 as long as he stayed in office he was going to be a divisive polarizing figure but beyond that he would give pakistani politicians something to argue about and something to focus on and an excuse for not dealing with the real problems facing the country
5600307 pakistanis now have no reason not to look inward and to begin to come to grips with the very serious economic and political and security challenges they face
5600308 as a great distraction pakistanis will have greater incentive to turn inward to look at the problems they confront and clearly the have to come face to face with the realization that their very country as theyve defined their country both in a territorial sense but also in terms of a sense of who they are as a people and what they stand for as a country is challenged
5600309 and now that the distraction of musharraf is being removed hopefully they can come to the conclusion that they have to get serious about fighting extremism not because washington wants them to not because washington tells them to not because washington bribes them to do so but because their country is going to fail if they dont
5600310 the us has no real tradition of granting asylum to former squalid dictators that it so lovingly coddled
5600311 one hopes that the turks or the saudis will give him a little villa where he can write his fictional memoirs ganguly said
5600312 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5600313 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5600314 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5600315 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5600316 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5600317 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5600318 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5600319 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5600320 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power

5600370 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
5600371 and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5600372 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such a biological profile if such a biological profile did exist
5600373 its nothing as simple as he has the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing

5600386 during a span of approximately fifteen years jeannette shifted from being an admiring fan to a discontented employee but she never ceased to believe wholeheartedly in the value of his research
5600387 although the reaction to the movie has been very enthusiastic from virtually everyone the reaction of the gay community has been extra enthusiastic
5600388 it doesnt surprise me that the gays have responded so well aside from the fact that its about theater creativity and passion i think the reason the film has resonated is because dana is a very emotionally open person you dont often get a protagonist like that in a film someone who wears his heart on his sleeve
5600389 i didnt want to make dana gay because i didnt want it to become just about him being gay
5600390 but those theater guys even when theyre straight still have this kind of flamboyance where theyre like i dont care what people think of me so we were definitely going for that fem het thing
5600391 the two of us did not want him to be that super camp limp wristed thing that ive seen done to death and find a bit tiresome
5600392 but we didnt want to go the other way either we did want him to have a feminine quality hes what you call a 100 metrosexual
5600393 since when did strippers start forgetting to go to the gym
5600394 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
5600395 is the only place in the solar system that can produce these orbits efficiently
5600396 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5600397 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5600398 i would expect them to discover thousands of such objects and with a data set so large we could do a pretty good job in finding out what the inner oort cloud looks like
5600399 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
5600400 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
5600401 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
5600402 alien contact would be the best thing to ever happen to planet earth
5600403 any alien civilization able to reach us is likely to regard our planet as
5600404 just look at how european settlers of the usa australia etc behaved this was natural behaviour i e genes maximizing their effectiveness and capture of resources in the new environment to the detriment of what was already there any alien race will have been subject to similar evolutionary pressures on its home planet and will have therefore acquired similar resource acquisition behaviour maybe they will study us as we study interesting new species in rainforests but we still cut rainforests down
5600405 most space fairing civilizations are peaceful proof any technological civilization that doesnt learn to live together in peace will either blow themselves up or be blown away by a killer asteroid while they are fighting amongst themselves they are probably here already anyway just making sure we dont make it into orbit around their planet unannounced would you want to wake up one day and find humans on your planet i dont think so we should stop projecting our own worst qualities on other intelligence space fairing civilizations it is an insult
5600406 were talking about initiating communication with other civilizations but we know nothing of their goals capabilities or intent

5600446 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5600447 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5600448 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5600449 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5600450 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5600451 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5600452 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5600453 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5600454 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5600455 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle

5600462 the chinese stock markets steep losses since the olympics began are also denting sentiment towards heavy industry such as steel makers and shipbuilders there are worries the chinese economy may not grow as robustly after the olympics
5600463 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5600464 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5600465 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups

5600468 the objective is to get to the top of as many towers as you can
5600469 you try to reach the hardest summit sometimes by jumping
5600470 jumping requires fearlessness a fair amount of agility and a high threshold for pain
5600471 back then there were several jumpers in on the scene
5600472 a few of the old timers say that jumping has no place here
5600473 but there is always some lunatic who goes crazy for it and becomes the dominant jumper in the region
5600474 everybody said the market would turn positive in july before the games so we listened and stayed in it
5600475 in july they said that the markets spirit would return when the olympics came what spirit is that now we are all dead and have no spirit left in the market
5600476 people just dont have a strong will to invest in the market
5600477 theres no logic to follow no other market falls as badly and accidentally as ours
5600478 it should be good now with the olympics inflation going down but that has nothing to do with the market in china i am so deeply trapped there is nothing i can do my account used to have 32 000 and now its only something like 8 800
5600479 we dont really care about the streak said walsh the saratoga native who played volleyball at archbishop mitty high and
5600480 its about how troubles at fannie and freddie would spill over to the broad financial sector thats the big concern
5600481 we had a day where no good news hit the tape and where there was a rekindling of these smoldering financial flames
5600482 we had a pretty good run there with the dollar going up pretty much every day
5600483 with buyers refusing to lift cargoes stocks will increase further and prices will fall
5600484 its a vicious circle and it is hard to predict an end to it
5600485 the jamboree gave us a chance to work under the lights with officials and some game time experience

5600493 i have a long history of depression and anxiety problems i obviously had a lot of time on my hands and while surfing the net all i found were depressing forums where people talked to each other about symptoms pills treatments and the like i couldnt find myself in those forums since they made me even more depressed than i already was
5600494 my chill pills is more than just a place for people to talk about their depression i wanted to make sure that that it was for depressed people as opposed to forums treating people as symptoms where they could talk to others that shared the same problems but they do not necessarily have to talk about their issues
5600495 i used to get people telling me all sorts of things that were either untrue or else demeaning like

5600565 are there any lessons for us to learn from all of this
5600566 they say hindsight is 20 20 but so is holy ghost insight and there was little if any insight offered into the goings on in lakeland
5600567 a doctrinal test for any revival is whether the content of the preaching is the same as jesus and the apostles the word of god stands over personal viewpoints
5600568 any biblical revival must contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints jude 3 if so called truth is being proclaimed that cannot be found in scripture then that proclamation violates the specific announcement of scripture that the faith was once for all entrusted and such a proclamation also deviates from the apostles fidelity to preach the word and from the early church s devotion to the apostles doctrine
5600569 i just dont feel i can endorse something thats being exaggerated
5600570 we hear about the dead being raised but we dont know who they are or where they are
5600571 with time whatever is taking place in lakeland and through activities issuing from its happenings will either verify or discredit the source of the manifestations
5600572 while many were slow to discern the goings on in lakeland no one can defend an extramarital relationship that causes a married couple to separate we do not yet know the extent of the exaggerated healing and miracle testimonies that came out of the lakeland outpouring nor do we know the extent of bentleys character issues these things will continue to unfold over the coming days weeks and maybe months
5600573 i can only think of how all of this grieved the holy spirit and how many people were hurt and feel cheated by this whole experience as leaders in the body of christ we must point people to jesus the author and finisher of our faith not to a man an angel or an outpouring hopefully we will learn some lessons here if any repentance is in order this must surely be the time for it

5600592 i believe harness racing has much to offer in enjoyment and family involvement at a small percentage of the cost of galloping yet harness people live in the shadow of the gallops
5600593 because of my involvement in major world sport all shareholders will not only have the fun excitement and the enjoyment of racing a horse with us but will also be invited as a team to attend sporting dinners and world title fights you will also meet some sporting greats at our functions and bbqs such as dawn fraser john raper jeff fenech suzie maroney etc some of whom will also be share holders in our racing team

5600596 we are one for one but have three tough races this friday night at harold park
5600597 jenny and i have decided to give this a real go we know that many hardworking australians can never really afford to pay the full purchase price of a nice horse so we are going to buy the horses and offer half to anyone that wants a share and we will retain the other half plus as an act of goodwill we will forgo all training fees for the first 12 months
5600598 we know that its the monthly fees that stop most average hardworking australians so ill pick up the tab on that for a year which should be more than long enough to see if the horse earns back their share purchase price

5600601 if youre a parent you cant hear an amber alert on the news or see a picture on the side of milk carton without a chill going down your spine thats why having all your childs pertinent information including their fingerprints is critical should your child ever turn up missing
5600602 as a plymouth business we care about the people and families of plymouth
5600603 an event like this may not prevent any child from ever turning up missing but if it raises awareness and gives parents a sense of security then its well worth it

5600611 thats sadly no surprise i am not dubious about healing i believe that god heals today we all know however that there are those who will use the power of god to peddle a product
5600612 whats most tragic about this cycle though is the fact that theres always a constituency for guys like this i fear that its more than just p t barnums famous old maxim about the gullibility of the american public i fear that theres something missing in our churches that drives even some of our people to charlatans might there be less of a demand for these traveling health and wealth revivalists if our churches spent more time on our knees in prayer for sick and hurting people

5600615 the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organization in gaza
5600616 the israeli authorities will ensure that the shipment reaches its destination via the land crossing points
5600617 is political and constitutes the legitimization of a terrorist organization
5600618 its not clear if the letter from the israeli ministry of foreign affairs signals a change of policy or is simply an attempt to open up an official dialogue
5600619 since the israeli foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza

5600623 in many countries there is governmental concern over self sustainability of liquid fuels as a result there is increasing worldwide interest in technology that will produce fuels that are more environmentally friendly and reduces the dependence on oil above all and most immediately we face the end of the cheap fossil fuel era and the memorandum of understanding with wits presents g4g with a unique opportunity to produce ultra clean liquid transportation fuel like diesel jet fuel and gasoline
5600624 we also welcome the opportunity to work with a team of scientists who are among the most accomplished in the world in this field this joint venture with wits is a strategic relationship for g4g and adds a great deal of value to shareholders

5600628 i had a toy fire truck that actually sprayed water she would make shoebox houses set them on fire in the driveway and let me put them out
5600629 some 40 years later i wrote about that in the nightline daily e mail she called me worried that people might think she was a bad mother for letting me play with fire
5600630 we had up to six suicide bombers on foot some of the bombers were able to blow themselves up outside the base and some have been killed by our forces
5600631 the firefight is still ongoing there are no casualties on our own side
5600632 due to the highly competitive nature of the online advertising industry the client has requested anonymity
5600633 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign
5600634 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again
5600635 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to it is unfortunate it is part of life part of culture these days and this is why we want to get involved we want to make a change
5600636 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives
5600637 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5600638 boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5600639 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5600640 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models
5600641 these days i just cant seem to say what i mean

5600649 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5600650 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5600651 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5600652 thirteen suicide bombers were killed in kijran area of ali sher district
5600653 they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5600654 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5600655 it gives you a chance to succeed if you focus on the little things and the details
5600656 they had won four games in the six years before i got there
5600657 every minute is accounted for every second one thing we never do is waste time
5600658 i rely on them heavily to teach the fundamentals to the players
5600659 it sneaked up on me i wish i had been more of a leader gotten more of the younger players to work out with me and get ready for the season
5600660 i started thinking about this my freshman year when we lost to reidsville in the playoffs
5600661 weve worked hard right now we just looking at the first game against garner weve got to look at it one game at a time
5600662 i wish you could concentrate on sportsmanship for a year put it in a jar and place it on a shelf and think you had taken care of it
5600663 the most wonderful part of it is not the almost superhuman achievements but the spirit in which it is done take away that spirit and it is done
5600664 he told me that it would be great if i decide to go to baylor but that i needed to make the best decision i could for myself and that he was proud of me wherever i go

5600669 alguns conseguiram explodir suas cargas outros se esconderam em casas pr ximas e em campos de milho est o sendo procurados pelas tropas

5600675 it is not us who are doing all this others posing as our supporters are responsible for this
5600676 we investigated and found it was not our supporter who attacked her but someone else who we dont even know
5600677 why do they accuse first and then report to the police why not go to the police first
5600678 i doubt the attackers were our supporters as our supporters were well behaved and orderly despite the huge turnout on saturday
5600679 we do not condone such behaviour and the incidents were undemocratic

5600685 the extent to which he needed to choose someone who would fill perceived holes in his resume lack of experience particularly in foreign policy versus a candidate who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5600686 senator biden the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee clearly fell into the category of helping mr obama on foreign policy while mr kaine is a relative newcomer to national politics and would reinforce the notion of change both mr kaine and mr bayh would help mr obama in a state that democrats are trying to put in play
5600687 biden who travelled to georgia this weekend at the behest of president mikhail saakashvili would be seen by many as a solid choice for obama on foreign policy he hasnt hesitated to launch sharp attacks on john mccain and he has a record of making prescient comments about pakistan among other issues
5600688 it may or may not be a coincidence that tim kaine and evan bayh appeared on sunday news programmes further stoking the kaine flame obama is scheduled to campaign in virginia on thursday
5600689 but the most curious recent development was sen joseph biden jrs trip to georgia this weekend obama campaign officials said the fact finding mission wasnt their idea but they did confirm discussing it in advance with bidens office

5600695 as we continue to grow the company were seeing increasingly strong activity across the compliance arena while the global financial situation becomes more challenging organizations need to ensure that they are operating efficiently controlling their business processes resolving issues in real time and reporting to senior management on the proficiencies of their business units
5600696 this drive for efficiency and oversight in regulated industry continues to power qumas successfully through these challenging times
5600697 the criticality of the qumas compliance solution is proven by the caliber of our client base
5600698 they trust our solution to provide compliance tracking and information that is board relevant as well as to provide guaranteed traceable compliance with global regulations
5600699 we are delighted to have advised american seafoods group on this milestone transaction which will increase the efficiency of the seafood sector in alaska glitnir has defined the seafood industry as a core niche market in which our recognized expertise continues to play a leading role our industry team in new york again successfully acted as the lead advisor on a significant industry transaction and our debt financing unit played a key role in its financing
5600700 institutionally glitnir is proud to be indirectly supporting the economic improvement of the alaskan communities given their ownership in asg
5600701 a valuable and trusted partner delivering results both as a financial backer and as an advisor throughout the transaction processes
5600702 our in depth knowledge of the client and the existing relationship with the owners of the target coupled with our integrated execution capability in advisory and debt financing helped unlock this highly strategic transaction as part of our niche focus our goal is to continually add value to our selected client base
5600703 the screening for hla b 5701 prior to abacavir treatment allows the identification of patients likely to develop hsr using hla b 5701 tests as a companion diagnostic with the drug abacavir therefore helps to better protect hiv infected patients in treatment from severe additional suffering
5600704 the combination of diagnostics and therapeutics is a key approach to eliminating risks of side effects and therefore increasing the efficacy of drugs
5600705 carbamazepine for instance which is prescribed for treatment of epilepsy is more likely to cause dangerous or even fatal skin reaction in asian patients carrying the hla b 1502 allele
5600706 our new test is another great example for the advent of molecular diagnostic tests which can be used to assess the efficacy of drugs this trend holds great promises for the future enabling doctors to customize therapies based on molecular tests which create molecular profiles of patients or diseases ultimately leads to more medical innovation cost efficiency and most importantly to better and safer treatment of patients
5600707 so far we have only seen the tip of the pharmacogenomic and companion diagnostic icebergs at qiagen we are proud of the roles that our sample and assay technologies and molecular diagnostics franchise contribute to bringing the vision of personalized medicine to reality
5600708 i think its good to look back on things and see how well the team performed at times
5600709 sometimes you can look back and take things from there into the next campaign
5600710 but its forgotten about now were all trying to qualify for the world cup now
5600711 the most important thing is we all work together like we did the last time as a squad because the boys all get on great and that will be a big part of it as well
5600712 we want to generate the same again and hopefully go that step further and get there we did play really well as a team and a squad
5600713 some games were unbelievable france away with faddys goal and its hard when you look back because i thought we were extremely unlucky not to qualify
5600714 but if we can get that bit of luck on our side this time and improve then we can hopefully do it
5600715 i dont know if ive established myself as a first team regular i have to prove myself first
5600716 i dont think you ever establish yourself as a first team regular you have to prove yourself every time
5600717 youve got to stay in the side its not a case of turning up every time and expecting to play i dont think any player can do that
5600718 if you take your foot off the gas youll lose your place because thats what its like here
5600719 ive been in a lot of squads now 14 i think but i didnt play a lot under alex mcleish because of the way things were going at that time the boys were playing brilliantly i was just happy being in the squad and getting a game when i could
5600720 theres a new manager in and weve all got a chance to impress any time in your career being involved in the international squad is great
5600721 when youre playing in good sides whether its celtic or scotland there are always good players beside you that will take your place if youre not performing
5600722 thats just the way football is when you are playing at the highest level
5600723 im maybe the type of player who can play a long time
5600724 ive looked after myself over the years and i feel as if i get fitter and stronger every year
5600725 i feel really good you just take it as it comes
5600726 we want to win every single game but as the manager points out he wants to try some things the more games you win it breeds confidence
5600727 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5600728 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and co2 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
5600729 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy
5600730 japan which has suffered atomic bomb attacks should take the initiative in blocking the deal
5600731 it would be a pity if japan only follows us policy irrespective of what is just
5600732 india needs to join the npt first if it wants civilian use of nuclear energy
5600733 if this kind of exception is approved that means that the international community accepts india as a nuclear power that would shake the non proliferation regime under the npt

5600735 i wish we had practiced better but it feels nice
5600736 or all the quarterbacks would have been inside icing their arms it is nice to finally have an indoor facility that you can actually throw a deep ball in
5600737 we would have been out there with thunderstorms grazing over our helmets
5600738 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days
5600739 were hopeful for the first game but its going to be close
5600740 its not an acl its not an operation its just rest
5600741 a hat trick in a quarter is not a bad night
5600742 he still has some pain which is understandable after that surgery
5600743 i had a hard time getting out of my stance
5600744 i spent all season rehabbing both of my shoulders and my thumb and then my back started having problems and it was kind of like good night very frustrating
5600745 i felt good just getting my feet back up under me and getting my timing down
5600746 we played a horribly sloppy game it was horrible and i wont stand for it coaches or players
5600747 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5600748 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5600749 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have i feel good about kyle leading our team
5600750 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5600751 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5600752 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that
5600753 im excited about the opportunity and i dont want to do something stupid and hurt something else by pushing too hard

5600760 oh lord thy sea is so great and my ship is so small have mercy
5600761 sometimes i feel like i dont know sometimes i feel like checking out i want to get it wrong cant always be strong and love it wont be long
5600762 throw a rock in the air and youll hit someone guilty
5600763 you bury your treasure where it cant be found but your love is like a secret thats been passed around there is a silence that comes to a house where no one can sleep
5600764 get it right theres no blood thicker than ink hear what i say nothings as simple as you think wake up some things you cant get around im in you more so when they put me in the ground
5600765 oh lord thy sea is so great and my ship is so small have mercy
5600766 we came from a situation where we produced 5 000 kg of corn by hectare while today it is 10 to 12 000 kg per hectare of corn
5600767 we have more chinese people eating we have more indians eating we have more africans eating and we have a lot more brazilians eating
5600768 all this which is treated by the press as if it were a crisis and is sold to the world as if it were a crisis
5600769 without any arrogance or self importance we brazilians need to confront what for others is a crisis as an extraordinary opportunity to truly transform ourselves into the granary of the world as many people have long predicted
5600770 without any doubt there is potential to produce if the government doesnt get in the way
5600771 we are not even going to say help if they dont get in the way a lot year by year the producer is generally increasing production
5600772 if you talk about central brazil there are still a lot of areas to be exploited so i dont have much doubt
5600773 what we have seen in the last 10 years is a quiet revolution happening in our country mostly in agribusiness production
5600774 we came from being an irrelevant international market participant to be one of the worlds major food and biofuel suppliers today
5600775 so if you look at what happened to our agriculture in terms of beef exports poultry exports again we were irrelevant and now we have the position of largest exporter in the world in major food crops
5600776 the impact will start to emerge with more intensity within 20 to 30 years and until then we should be preparing for this
5600777 the perspective for the moment for future harvests is highly productive so brazil has the potential to continue growing around 5 to 6 a year in terms of increasing harvests we are going to effectively maintain this rhythm in the coming years without any problem
5600778 we are not against expanding the brazilian capacity for producing food and helping brazil to develop this country
5600779 you can increase the food capacity through technology through better practices through occupying areas that are already degraded to investing in better crops
5600780 but you can not increase your productivity at the expense of the environment because the global market doesnt accept this price any more
5600781 if we have the right investments coming on for logistics for infrastructure and for technology and land development the country can multiply by two and a half three times the actual production in the next 10 years
5600782 of course we have increases that could come from europe from the usa from canada from argentina
5600783 but where you see the best conditions in order to give the world society the best rate of return in terms of investment is in brazil
5600784 if you talk about the next five years we are now producing 130 million tonnes of grains we can easily go to 250 million tonnes
5600785 we are now producing seven million hectares of sugar cane this can go to 20 million hectares helping to supply ethanol to the world we are only exporting 400m of fruits we can go to 3bn of fruits
5600786 next up is africa i think for africa this could be a redemption in terms of inclusion of people in production systems and making africa produce food and biofuels for the world
5600787 world demand for food today is one billion tonnes and brazil produces 150 million tonnes
5600788 brazil produces 150 million tonnes and the plan launched by the government for more food will produce six million more which is going to leave one million for export how is brazil going to be the granary of food production
5600789 why dont you go walk faster hurry up youre annoying me
5600790 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa

5600792 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairytale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan

5600813 the russian troops have been very kind they give chocolates to the children and cigarettes to the men we are now afraid of what will happen if they leave we think that the ossetian militia will simply come in and there will be trouble we do not believe that the trouble is over it is frightening at night and we can hear gunfire in surrounding areas we need international forces here as soon as possible

5600816 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
5600817 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
5600818 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
5600819 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
5600820 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person

5600822 nouriel has a different way of seeing things than most economists he gets into everything

5600824 were in uncharted territory where standard economic theory isnt helpful
5600825 the justification for his bearish call has evolved over the years
5600826 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
5600827 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
5600828 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
5600829 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
5600830 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
5600831 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
5600832 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages
5600833 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis
5600834 but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5600835 a good third of the regional banks wont make it
5600836 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states

5600874 they have to find a way to give china clear incentives to collaborate with them hopefully in a transition to some longer term accommodation the terms of which they dont know yet
5600875 as long as you have a government in taipei that is going to work hard to not provoke the chinese i would see the probability of china using military force against taiwan diminishing not increasing even as china becomes much more capable militarily

5600885 mccain who went second was crisp by contrast to obama and his anecdotes colorful
5600886 members of the mccain campaign staff who flew here sunday from california said mr mccain was in his motorcade on the way to the church as mr obama was being interviewed
5600887 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5600888 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence

5600894 parents get angry when theyre spanking and its not working
5600895 if a child gets spanked so often they just dont care anymore and will misbehave anyway
5600896 people want to change behavior immediately and they think spanking is the way to go
5600897 down the line though these children do far worse that relationship of trust is broken
5600898 spanking can be administered in a loving manner to help children understand whats right and wrong
5600899 but its not just something that ought to be done with little thought
5600900 plastic plumbing pipe a 3 foot shrub cutting or a belt
5600901 it broke my heart i worried about him hating me
5600902 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5600903 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5600904 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5600905 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5600906 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5600907 their goal is to get as much in them as possible before they go out because once theyre out they cant get caught with alcohol
5600908 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5600909 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5600910 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5600911 she initiated it and we discussed it and decided that was the appropriate thing to do as she dealt with some personal business
5600912 i would certainly be for an override i believe the bill is valuable to the economy and its a very safe well constructed piece of legislation
5600913 i guess you could say i may have gotten eliminated early and not know it
5600914 i mean you could get all that online now anyway to be as specific as possible i dont have any interest in going to washington
5600915 the best case scenario is that we get several inches in western north carolina to charge the reservoirs
5600916 it brought some good rain down there but they didnt get any serious kind of winds or storm surge
5600917 minimal hurricane or its a tropical storm we talked about short lived relatively weak tornadoes as far as i know all of those events have killed people in florida
5600918 i really thought they were dead the way they had gotten hit
5600919 based on what happened nine out of 10 times its going to end up worse than it did
5600920 he is a super kid it seems as though he made a bad judgment
5600921 and i cant imagine what the parents of those girls are going through we hope that everything gets better that they make a full recovery and there are no side effects of any of this
5600922 hes a person whos never been in trouble in his life in any way
5600923 ive seen more death on the highway than id like to think about
5600924 the roads themselves should be safer than they were in the past
5600925 is it people driving drunk is it people who have no license and maybe dont understand our rules who are dying and causing deaths
5600926 alcohol is also involved in a lot of these fatalities
5600927 from time to time therell be a spike in highway deaths its just one year that it spiked so far this year were significantly down
5600928 if youre doing 65 theyre doing 95 you expect somebody to yield and they dont
5600929 i talk to troopers and i ask them why people here dont signal before they change lanes they say to me we dont enforce that unless theres an accident i mean you gotta be kidding me
5600930 if you go into virginia you dont dare go fast on i 85 between the end of our state and richmond the police are up there and people know theyre up there so they slow down and take it easy
5600931 so obviously theres a lot more people driving on the highway than troopers
5600932 were out there doing our part doing what we can to try to combat that dwi problem in our state
5600933 they ought to hire a slew of them and let them get out there and do their jobs
5600934 meanwhile we just have to be prepared to protect ourselves when were out there
5600935 he made a poor choice he made a wrong choice
5600936 i dont know what they paid the postal service but they obviously didnt get what they paid for
5600937 parked in such a manner that it appeared to have been unloading or loading something
5600938 mr young could have done a walk through to look for items that were missing or out of place
5600939 he could have provided the names of persons that may have had a conflict with him or his wife he could have provided information on recent visitors or workers that may have been in the residence
5600940 both groups cause panic and fear and havoc within our communities
5600941 one did it based on the color of someones skin and the other does it based on the color of a piece of cloth
5600942 but after the federal government became involved their influence faded we want to do the same with the gangs
5600943 obviously the gang legislation passed by the state was a good start
5600944 it allowed us to standardize what a gang is and provides funding for prevention and intervention
5600945 isnt enough but were very encouraged by that level of funding
5600946 we have to have that we still have levels of violence that are unacceptable but those are two significant changes weve seen
5600947 its really a challenging time in young students lives because they are on their own for the first time
5600948 some kids who have been sheltered they find it difficult to just transition from having parents providing three meals a day to making their own selections
5600949 freshmen have a schedule packed with classes that makes it difficult to eat regular meals
5600950 i encourage them to look at their class schedule and find times to eat their meals its not a good idea to rush to class and not eat anything until 2 p m
5600951 i know a lot of college students really enjoy sleeping late and then rushing to classes but i think its really important to take time for that meal
5600952 they dont want to miss the social experience but i tell them they can enjoy their friends without eating again if theyve already had dinner
5600953 during finals we had an ice cream night and a doughnut night
5600954 and you can almost always find someone who wants to order pizza
5600955 i recommend that when they go to a dining hall they first start with a salad or soup
5600956 which has been shown to curb appetite and then later eat food that is more calorically dense
5600957 the hardest thing is to just let students know there are resources available
5600958 that there is a dietitian on campus that students can see for free
5600959 assess supervise and monitor the delivery of care to assure basic needs
5600960 the nursing staff had evaluated the patients nutrition the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake
5600961 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking
5600962 they wouldnt let me see him i think he died that day
5600963 i have not seen the heimlich maneuver now in over 20 years i couldnt see well or tell if he was injured by the fall
5600964 who was sitting at a table in the dayroom playing cards
5600965 de onderhandelingen zijn toegewezen aan een onafhankelijke expert voor de finale afronding
5600966 we certainly want to know what exactly happened that morning
5600967 it was an honour note how noe how quickly noe has become anglicized to be nominated at all it is one of the most prestigious and difficult awards to get nevertheless it means that our contribution to this 2 100 show festival didnt go unnoticed
5600968 narcissus lament having fallen in love as a punishment with his own image in the river styx is one of the highlights a booming baritone capturing the sadness and loneliness of the moment slightly repetitive in places and slow in pace this is not necessarily for everyone but lovers of greek mythology and classical music will more than enjoy the sweeping score and haunting beauty which lie at the heart of this music led theatre piece
5600969 despite its setting in the underworld just out of reach has a strangely soothing effect fear and obsession are tempered by a five piece band and the lilting american voices of the strong cast with emotive song and dance the cast relay mystery and yearning but for us the significance of the piece is just out of reach
5600970 the pittsburgh new music ensemble cant do it all but they can do a lot making their fringe d but the group have produced a show of remarkable versatility that highlights their extraordinary individual talents just out of reach is an aural and a visual delight incorporating mime live score dance and comedy it as an ambitious performance that at times both challenges and enthrals its audience this is an elaborate work that may not be to everyones tastes but even if your existential and classics knowledge is zero the beauty of the music performed here and the sheer quality of the individual performances is utterly convincing if you want a show that is both strikingly original and genuinely entertaining then you could do much worse than just out of reach
5600971 as in any airport these days concessions are still doing well when theyre located in concourses where flights have not been cut
5600972 any food beverage or retail operation located near a closed gate would be having more difficulty
5600973 i would say that when people are at the airport as passengers waiting for a flight theyre really interested in many things to do whereas a person going to a mall has a specific purpose
5600974 were in our second year now and it has been business as usual in sacramento

5600979 at a time when were raising taxes and telling people we couldnt find any savings and all in the budget that were now going to have and im sorry basically a 400 000 party if were not real careful

5600993 the hispanic population is growing whites and asians are not replacing themselves
5600994 its the hispanic population that is keeping us above water in terms of growth in terms of births
5600995 we need to focus a lot more than we have before on the education opportunities for immigrant children this makes very clear that theyre a big part of our future
5600996 i wondered why that was true and found that those second generation hispanic mothers did have higher education attainment than the third generation
5600997 it means that 25 years from now therell be many elderly people who are childless and who may not have anybody to care for them
5600998 theres just not enough people to work in the restaurants the pay is so much better
5600999 prices keep going up because they know they can get it

5601095 residents along the coastal areas under storm warnings are alerted against big waves and storm surges generated by this tropical cyclone
5601096 i think the political leaders have no excuse now they have to address the immediate issues like inflation and the long term structural problems of pakistani polity they cant use musharraf as an excuse any more
5601097 it is a change about the democratic spirit and transition and the establishment of constitutionality
5601098 it is now really a test of their ability and a test of their capacity to deliver
5601099 this led to paralysis during which little was achieved and the economy faltered
5601100 now we can expect more normal politics politics are inherently competitive but the ruling coalition partners are likely to stay together for a while
5601101 there s a difference between nitrogen species going into the leaves and that process being useful
5601102 if plants really can use the by product organic nitrates then this will ultimately help to remove nox from the atmosphere

5601115 this is a special fragrance personal whimsical playful and romantic to me fancy is just that fancy
5601116 i dont want a bunch of scientists telling me that they know more than i do about all the dogs ive known over 40 years
5601117 the welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration
5601118 we soon discovered that the members of the production company seemed to have pre conceived and extremely biased views on the subject alarm bells rang when we found out the biased nature of many of the questions being posed both to ourselves and to others
5601119 very concerned about the unacceptably high levels of disability in pedigree dogs
5601120 the vast majority of breeders do not do close breeding
5601121 there is overwhelming scientific evidence to support the fact that there is a major problem this is a time bomb waiting to happen the odds are heavily stacked against pedigree dogs
5601122 the primary objective of the kennel club is to promote in every way the general improvement of dogs whilst going on national television to state they are powerless to prevent sibling matings
5601123 its going to be like that for the next three too
5601124 were trying to play with a chip on our shoulder we go out every night and try to get better

5601127 we know argentina is a very experienced team we hope to have a little revenge because they knocked us out in the last olympic tournament in greece in our home
5601128 when you play a team like argentina the first thing no mistakes patience and try to have a clear mind on every pass and every time you defend
5601129 it will be a difficult game they have a lot of players that can change the game everyone of them that means we need a lot of concentration

5601134 i cant put it into words what it was like to start in front of 76 000 at old trafford
5601135 it is what i have been working for since i joined the club

5601143 we have some big challenges ahead against portsmouth liverpool and chelsea but we rise to the big challenges
5601144 we are two points behind chelsea arsenal and liverpool so unfortunately we have given them a head start
5601145 we are playing catch up already but we have been there before it is a long season and it is only day one there are 37 games to go and we play everybody twice
5601146 it wasnt the start we wanted to draw the first game is disappointing we created enough chances to win the match but shay given pulled off some fantastic saves we would have liked to create more in the last 10 15 minutes but it didnt happen
5601147 it didnt happen in the first couple of games last season either in the first game especially and hopefully the same thing will happen and we can really kick on and put the chances away and win matches
5601148 but it is another game under our belts for our fitness levels we are away now with our national teams and a few players will get another game there so we will be ready to go for portsmouth
5601149 he looked so sharp to get a pre season behind him that he never had last year was vital
5601150 it was disappointing to lose him with the shortage of numbers up front but we still should have been good enough to win against newcastle
5601151 nevertheless well be getting players back and we will be a formidable squad again
5601152 you know with giggsy when he gets it wide that he is going to get a yard and put a cross in

5601158 because we didnt want to be a slave to anybody elses watered down crap ideas we wanted to make our own crap ideas
5601159 although we males are inscribed within culture from birth and there is a question of the roles played by genetics and biology there is a sense in which we also make choices about how to inhabit our maleness

5601190 we welcome the key findings of this paper it highlights the importance of training and support for healthcare staff in delivering fundamental essential care and services to older people
5601191 more importantly it also emphasises the need for more government action through the recruitment and retention of specialist nurses as well as adequate funding to increase the level of services available to our most vulnerable citizens
5601192 this would reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts
5601193 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5601194 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5601195 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5601196 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5601197 these forums illustrate how sophisticated intellectual practices to improve game play mimic actual scientific reasoning
5601198 gamers are openly discussing their strategies and thinking creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned by playing these online video games

5601208 our influenza program is a superb example of the convergence of both our novel rnai technologies and proprietary drug delivery capabilities
5601209 in order to accelerate development of this important lead candidate capitalize on the significant research effort conducted by our team and fully realize its commercial potential as a therapeutic against a pandemic influenza outbreak we are seeking a strategic partnership with a company focused in the biodefense or infectious disease area
5601210 there is a significant need for a safe and effective therapy that can target highly pathogenic influenza strains such as avian flu and to have that therapy stockpiled for a pandemic outbreak
5601211 capitalizing on both our proprietary rnai technologies and our proprietary drug delivery capabilities we have developed an rnai based compound that can address all strains of influenza a virus by targeting conserved regions of the influenza viral genome ongoing and future studies in collaboration with the u s centers for disease control and prevention will continue to analyze the intranasal delivery of our dicer substrate sirna for influenza and provide us further insight into the strength of our therapeutic and delivery approaches
5601212 how certain factors traditionally considered risk factors can be reconceptualized as adaptive or protective processes
5601213 institutional racism and societal prejudice place all african american youth including well resourced youth at some degree of risk
5601214 understanding what makes them strong requires acknowledging their experience here in the united states and how discrimination affects their daily lives the study of success is just as important as the study of failure
5601215 there were many difficult challenges in that moment of inexperience we listened we faced their anger we saw they had unique insights that complement ours
5601216 from that point on the relationship between genentech and the advocacy community has steadily improved

5601228 clement said an expert panel commissioned by the federal health department last year found that insite has had no impact on reducing the transmission of blood borne illnesses such as hiv aids

5601230 who do you want to believe do you want to believe published articles in the new england journal or lancet do you want to believe the world health organization or do you want to believe tony clement its embarrassing
5601231 health minister tony clement says his government will not necessarily oppose safe injection sites for illegal drugs in quebec even though it will appeal a court decision allowing a similar facility in british columbia
5601232 the quarterback rotation will be the same for chicago on thursday we have a short week to prepare and i want to keep the team focused on the bears
5601233 the starters will most likely play the first half with the second unit coming in during the third quarter
5601234 at a time when were raising taxes and telling people we couldnt find any savings and all in the budget that were now going to have and im sorry basically a 400 000 party if were not real careful
5601235 i think the taxpayers would have a fit over that
5601236 a multi cultural experience that celebrates and promotes the legacy and heritage of african americans
5601237 the way the economys looking would give anybody pause especially with new taxes
5601238 theres just so many times you can ask the public to raise its own taxes
5601239 she initiated it and we discussed it and decided that was the appropriate thing to do as she dealt with some personal business
5601240 i would certainly be for an override i believe the bill is valuable to the economy and its a very safe well constructed piece of legislation
5601241 i guess you could say i may have gotten eliminated early and not know it

5601244 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
5601245 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5601246 our goal is to help bring borrowers and lenders together so that the family gets to keep their home and the bank does not lose money on the loan
5601247 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5601248 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5601249 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions
5601250 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5601251 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5601252 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5601253 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5601254 these companies make their decisions and their bets they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

5601258 save a watt is designed to limit energy efficiency so they can build big power plants
5601259 if they were serious theyd put more than just a zero on the table that plan is a dog
5601260 youre suggesting that we want to make a quick profit and get out of town

5601262 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving
5601263 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5601264 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5601265 thirteen suicide bombers were killed in kijran area of ali sher district
5601266 they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5601267 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5601268 we also believe that the decline may be attributed to the challenges we face in merchandising our expanded product lines in existing wholesale channels as well as the maturity of our core products in the consumer market and lessening demand for such product
5601269 decline in demand of certain shoe styles experienced in the second quarter
5601270 we have agreed a fee with newcastle for shola and he spent yesterday at the club having a medical

5601278 the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
5601279 words that work its not what you say its what people hear
5601280 and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5601281 erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront evil when we see it
5601282 abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5601283 weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years and abortions have not gone down
5601284 taken to the soiled utility room and left alone to die
5601285 a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5601286 just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
5601287 we still have a belief in eadys guilt which made for an agonizing decision
5601288 i expect that there will be shades of the truth told in a trial
5601289 but we rely on certain foundational things that someone is not going to tell a straight out lie this is very frustrating and disturbing
5601290 we have prioritized the implementation of these flood control structures because masbate is located within the typhoon belt the newly built structures now protect a total of seven barangay and 40 hectares of agricultural lands

5601320 we hear a lot of ideas from politicians about lowering the gas prices and fighting global warming whether its biofuels offshore drilling or nuclear power but none of those will affect the gas prices right now only you can do that

5601353 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
5601354 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
5601355 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
5601356 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear

5601362 we want to create a public space which draws people from the city centre at the moment families do not linger on jesus green because when they need a cup of coffee or to take their children to the toilet they go somewhere else
5601363 there is a kiosk and some disgusting toilets but we want to bring the two elements together with something similar to the area on parkers piece
5601364 nothing integrates very well so we are trying to make everything flow together for instance the childrens play area is very dark and needs renewing
5601365 we want to move it to the other side of the pool where parents could have a coffee and watch their children in the park
5601366 the broad outline of these plans is sensible there are one or two things which worry us however such as the path and avenue of trees from victoria avenue which breaks up the area of green space
5601367 it is used by a large number of people and we feel this path destroys the greens sense of openness we do not want to see jesus green swallowed up by hard surfaces

5601376 said john walsh mda dataquick president the median price paid for a southland home was 348 000 last month down 2 0 percent from 355 000 in june and down 31 1 percent from 505 000 for july 2007 that peak of 505 000 was reached in march april may and july of last year the median has fallen because of depreciation especially in inland markets and because of the steep drop off in home financing in the so called jumbo category which until recently was defined as loans above 417 000 before the credit crunch hit in august 2007 nearly 40 percent of southland sales were financed with jumbo loans jumbos last month accounted for 15 8 percent of southland sales

5601391 last month people loved the meeting they were still there 2 hours after the meeting ended the format is the best as we are bringing in local experts for people to hear
5601392 were very pleased with our accomplishments in this years omni competition and extremely proud all of our staff and officer matt barnett of the glendale az who did a wonderful narration of this call for information
5601393 it is gratifying to know that the expertise and talent of our staff has been recognized by our peers within the industry
5601394 it is not just his and his staffs videography or the engineering and delivery of the material that make an award winning entry so it is always nice to share the recognition with the narrator in a news story
5601395 many times the main on screen personality is the pio at an accident scene or a foreman at a construction site
5601396 women went so crazy for the black and white dress michelle obama wore on the view that the makers of the dress could hardly keep it on the shelves
5601397 and remember cindy mccains red leather jacket that caused such a stir clearly these women in spite of their differences are both very stylish individuals i wanted to capture their different styles in two distinct handbags for those who want to follow in their fashionable footsteps
5601398 her style strikes me as classic and ladylike but shes also shown an edgy youthful side and a willingness to stand out
5601399 with two young girls mrs obama could probably use some extra room in her bag
5601400 i gave her purse a hot red liner so she can channel her inner patriot
5601401 whether they want to show off their political leanings or just make a stylish statement all their own the look of their bag totally in their hands
5601402 i am so happy to be working here at jo to go

5601407 regular data recovery service costs can typically exceed 1000 when physical damage to a hard drive prevents a user from accessing their files
5601408 consumers can avoid this financial burden with one or three years of unlimited coverage provided by a cbl data recovery service protection plan
5601409 for australians whose livelihoods and data depend on their pcs or laptops the cbl drspp is an affordable alternative to standard data recovery fees when data loss disaster strikes
5601410 owners of laptops who unintentionally expose their systems to extreme handling will also find cbls plans financially attractive after all its not a matter of if data loss disaster will strike its simply a matter of when
5601411 now we have a government thats more open thats disposed to listening to our demands and thats beginning to generate some changes

5601414 wir verbessern das system organisch damit einher geht auch dass die plattform schrittweise stabiler wird
5601415 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5601416 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5601417 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5601418 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5601419 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5601420 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5601421 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5601422 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5601423 highlights the need for international fact finding missions in georgia
5601424 obviously shes very upset and got a flight back immediately for treatment
5601425 our team handled the largest number of individual debt accounts last month while also negotiating the highest overall debt amount in one month
5601426 they continue to raise the bar and i know our clients are looking forward to more record breaking results in the near future
5601427 while all settlements have a positive impact on our clients its the first settlement that really helps our clients realize a seemingly insurmountable debt can be resolved with our help
5601428 as a team our department is continuously perfecting our strategy
5601429 negotiators understand specific tactics for helping our clients get the lowest settlements possible such as the importance of timing negotiations and settlement offers for optimal results
5601430 many creditors are familiar with the debt shield name and they know we service clients who genuinely need assistance
5601431 if our company did not have such a solid reputation it would be more challenging to reach settlements with creditors
5601432 kingston on lake oconee will be a retreat that allows homeowners to own a piece of the lake and enjoy a resort community with fantastic amenities and beautiful homes
5601433 we are creating an environment where you can live and vacation year round
5601434 it is honor to receive a highly respected national award for work in showcasing events that take place in the city of glendale

5601436 the glendale gaslight inn was having a grand opening after being bought and refurbished by paul and teresa seabrook and was having the world renowned jazz singing star nicolas bearde present for the opening festivities and the first live jazz show there
5601437 it was really exciting to be a part of the grand opening of the glendale gaslight inn it was amazing to see how paul and teresa had transformed the inn
5601438 creating and opening the glendale gaslight inn was such an exciting time for us and as we discovered for historic downtown glendale your video certainly captures that excitement as well as the inns character the video has been enjoyed by many people via our website and it has been very influential in visitors choosing to stay at our unique inn
5601439 i had fun being the director and cameraman on this production but it was also my interviewer julie rae the environment that the seabrooks have created here their hospitality and the fine jazz music of nicolas bearde that enabled us to win this award
5601440 i edit tighter now so it would not be quite as long and i would encode it at a higher bit rate as most people do not have the lower end dsl speed offering any longer higher bandwidth means better audio and video quality
5601441 with the aggregate financial impact consistent with our previous announcement
5601442 raising awareness and funds to help sponsor orphans and filming genocide survivor testimonies
5601443 i can count on one hand the number of people here with any kind of crop this year
5601444 but growers are the ultimate optimists hopefully well have a good crop next year
5601445 i dont care if youre making spark plugs or olives you need a constant flow into the market
5601446 we cant build a market and then say we dont have any olives this year
5601447 compared to the last two years this is a pleasant change of pace
5601448 this would be considered an average to slightly above average crop and a night and day difference from the last two years
5601449 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5601450 we need these monitors in there and we need them now
5601451 if we cant get those military observers in there i dont think the cease fire will hold
5601452 research reveals men are four times as likely to ask for higher pay than are women with the same qualifications from career promotions to help with childcare studies show time and again that women dont ask and frequently dont even realise they can
5601453 its a problem hiding in plain sight in the workplace women dont know how much men negotiate and men dont know how little women do and it isnt always about money it can be about the projects youre assigned to or the team youre in for example negotiation is no longer optional it has become a basic survival skill
5601454 we socialise girls to hold back not rock the boat and be grateful for what they have boys are given different messages theyre made feel the world is out there for them and are empowered in so many ways women often think its part of their personality to be afraid of asking for things but society has placed them in this role
5601455 start by negotiating several small things something small means the stakes are low and you wont be devastated if you dont get it
5601456 check if there is any precedent to what youre asking for examine possible obstacles and research what people in comparable roles are getting paid choose a time when youre calm and feel your boss will really hear you people hate ultimatums so a better way is to explain that you like working there and want to find a way to stay present some ideas that would make you happy and show how they would work for the organisation

5601462 our goal for zooper tours is that individuals will leave feeling inspired to help conservation causes and that they will share their experience with others along the way
5601463 traditionally we give muki food treats but we risk overfeeding if thats the only enrichment activity
5601464 we just picked up some perfume cheap at a garage sale so we can use it to keep animals busy not bored
5601465 there is more to the modern zoo than many people in the community realize
5601466 its doubly hard for us in montana to help people understand the role of a zoo because people are used to places like the old red lodge zoo which we would now refer to as a roadside menagerie
5601467 i was in the trees a lot and had to hit some recovery shots
5601468 i usually hit my driver really straight but now im spraying it and struggling a little bit with it
5601469 i will have to go work on it later tonight
5601470 i didnt make too many mistakes i missed a couple of real easy short birdies on the front side but just played real solid at a couple under par on the back
5601471 if youre not in the fairway theres no way you can shoot at some of these pins
5601472 i had to take a penalty and made bogey there
5601473 i hit it through the fairway on 10 and was in the fairway bunker
5601474 i hit a 5 iron to within a foot of the pin that kept me going a little bit
5601475 i dont think our section gets the respect it deserves
5601476 i would put our top seven to 10 guys against any other section in the country i think were by far just as talented as anybody out there but since were a smaller section we dont get as many spots to national events
5601477 for how i hit the ball ill take 71 and get out of dodge
5601478 ive played plenty of rounds out here at yellowstone so i was happy with it the pins were in some spots that were tough to get at and the first day you always play a little conservatively
5601479 thats what people have always come to see in the park
5601480 they came to look into the past to see something pristine to me the parks first century was defined by a certain stability
5601481 the mountains and the depth of nature seemed very long lived theyd always been here and always would be here
5601482 weve come to a very interesting turning point if the first century was defined by the past and by stability then the second century is the exact opposite now were looking at the future and at remarkable instability now all of a sudden were faced with how fragile a system like this can be
5601483 weve always gone to nature because it is so huge and we are so little
5601484 weve gone to feel humble and to put ourselves in perspective but today when we go were also reminded that we actually affect everything theres not a place on the planet that we havent touched not even a wilderness like glacier
5601485 no amount of preparation will ready us for whats to come
5601486 because by mid century things are really going to start changing here in ways well all see and feel directly
5601487 have been flat or on the decline for many many years
5601488 parks like glacier are the anchor stores of our economy
5601489 and it makes sense to invest in them the centennial is a good time to be thinking about how to do that
5601490 were going to have to make some tough choices in glaciers second century
5601491 what we have here is a learning moment and were trying to capitalize on that
5601492 we have glaciers that are receding and infrastructure that is deteriorating and more visitors all the time this is tangible stuff people can touch it they can see it with their own eyes
5601493 what we really want is to use the centennial to create programs that last well into the future
5601494 we dont want a crazy sugar buzz up to 2010 thats just going to crash in 2011 we need to keep our eyes on the long term future here
5601495 i think we owe it to the voters to back off as much as we owe it to the kids to make these repairs
5601496 you get a little girl who picks out that pink backpack and she gets a smile that wide
5601497 a large majority of these clients are making 20 000 and less and they may have three or four kids
5601498 the prices of things out there are going up and consequently people are struggling especially the low income or under employed
5601499 we had always recognized that billings is a great place to raise a family but theres nothing for kids to do
5601500 we needed a catalyst for the subdivision and we wanted to provide something that puts billings on the map
5601501 the business objective of the water park is to capture some of these visitors
5601502 she was nervous on the two passes between coeur dalene and missoula
5601503 its interesting to see how other people tour the park
5601504 this actually comes to a bridge over mcdonald creek with a good view of mcdonald falls
5601505 if this is moderate i dont think i want to take a serious one
5601506 when we left home at the end of june the corn was knee high id love to see their reaction to this
5601507 what a job to have to deal with that every day
5601508 the road seemed steep and windy and treacherous but it was worth it so worth it im glad i came
5601509 a lot of people in our congregation back home have been to glacier
5601510 some of them know my fear of heights and will never believe i did this now i dont have to go home and pretend i did it because im here
5601511 its been a couple of years since weve been there
5601512 but i always enjoy racing in montana being from north dakota ive got a great deal of appreciation for montana and they have a nice track there in billings
5601513 the last time we were there we had a really good car and were on our way to winning the feature until we lost a rear end
5601514 thats racing though you have to finish to win and that night we didnt since then weve been on a really good roll so maybe by getting back to billings our luck will be better and well come out on top with this armor all number 15 powered by chevy
5601515 i know everyone on this tony stewart racing team is working their tail off so that we can stay on top
5601516 we are out there to win races and last week we werent fighting for wins like we need to be
5601517 this is one of my favorite times of the year
5601518 when we head west and race in places that we only get to once a year
5601519 its going to be important to get out the vote in this because all signs point to not a very high voter turnout
5601520 i spoke to the senior center here earlier today and now im going door to door
5601521 a wyoming vote for the senate is 60 times greater than it would be in california
5601522 its a competitive race that has candidates who are reasonably well known well funded and obviously have two wings of the party kind of opposing one another
5601523 when it comes right down to it wyoming doesnt really know why juveniles are locked up our lack of a systematic way of collecting data makes it very difficult to accurately develop a profile of juvenile offenses and reasons for detention
5601524 i think everybody understands now and i dont hear any disagreement with the concept jail is not good for kids
5601525 unless there is a threat to the community or themselves they shouldnt be there
5601526 our separate and incompatible information systems make it difficult to monitor juvenile incarcerations in a comprehensive and integrated manner
5601527 wyoming may be the equality state but equality has little to do with how juveniles are treated within our justice system
5601528 where a juvenile lives in wyoming is far more indicative of how that youth will be treated and whether or not they will spend time in jail
5601529 placing youth in adult jails because its the only option results in priming our youth for the adult correctional system
5601530 but this is way more than just a birthday party
5601531 this is a whole program of events that look back at the past and hopefully build for the future
5601532 those are projects wed like to have done by the birthday
5601533 combining the park with the nonprofits and the local communities because we all rely on our partners more than ever
5601534 the need has never been greater and the time to get involved has never been better
5601535 we want to get another years worth of data to help demonstrate the value of the demonstration protocols for possible use on a broader scale
5601536 out of this hopefully were going to have some real changes in how medicare pays
5601537 id like to have them say weve pretty much proven if you follow heart failure patients with this method it saves lives and saves money
5601538 we dont think medicare is paying for the right things
5601539 it appears to be that theres a lot of demand for wyoming hay
5601540 theres a strong demand for hay all over the country
5601541 thats an awful lot of people that are touching the web site looking for hay
5601542 its hard to translate that to actual sales i know that theres a lot of repeat buyers and sellers
5601543 its a shifty crop its got the potential to be really good or really bad
5601544 the district is half my senate district and ive knocked on all of those doors
5601545 but write ins are tough to do at any point in time
5601546 we were actually planning to give them to churches in china
5601547 i really didnt think we would have a problem i figured it would probably be a breeze to get through customs
5601548 they eventually gave us one bible each and said we could pick up the others on our way back out of china
5601549 we feel like what we endured was very minimal compared to what our chinese brothers and sisters go through every day for the gospel

5601560 tesco and sainsburys must stop this punishing local pricing and play fair by all consumers
5601561 a tesco customer in banbridge derry or dungannon is being charged 2 50 more each time they fill their tank than a tesco customer in bangor sainsburys do the same charging customers in forestside or lisburn more than customers in coleraine
5601562 the consumer council believes that this practice is blatantly unfair
5601563 we are confident that the local customer is getting a great deal on fuel
5601564 as with the vast majority of petrol retailers in the uk including the oil majors eg bp shell and esso and other supermarket groups tesco does not operate a national price our clear goal for customers is to endeavour to be competitive on petrol and diesel in the local catchment area for each store

5601569 vettel ist sicher einer der ein ganz gro er werden kann ich sage immer ein berflieger
5601570 man muss unterscheiden zwischen sehr guten rennfahrern und berfliegern die es nur alle zehn jahre gibt zu denen geh rten michael schumacher und ayrton senna jetzt geh rt meiner meinung nach auch ein lewis hamilton dazu vettel k nnte so einer sein man wei es noch nicht genau
5601571 beim timo glaube ich dass er ein sehr guter rennfahrer ist dass er auch rennen gewinnen kann wenn er im richtigen auto sitzt aber berflieger da habe ich hoffnung bei vettel
5601572 berflieger haben einfach ein geschenk gottes das andere nicht bekommen haben
5601573 haben einfach ein geschenk gottes das andere nicht bekommen haben wir haben immer nur wenige gesehen die so etwas zustande gebracht haben und die haben dann meistens ganze zeitspannen diktiert michael schumacher ist das beste beispiel die kommen nur selten da stimmt einfach alles die haben irgendwie die verschiedenen faktoren die ein rennfahrer braucht in ausgewogener qualit t es geht ja nicht nur um das reine fahrtalent sondern es geht auch darum im rennen alles richtig zu machen man muss es auf die reihe kriegen und dann auch noch renngl ck haben
5601574 er ist sehr fr h in die formel 1 gekommen und er war zuerst sehr schnell aber noch nicht reif ich glaube das kann man im nachhinein jetzt sehen als er dann zu toro rosso kam war er schockiert wie schlecht ein formel 1 auto sein kann er hat sich dann ja gegen ende des jahres gemausert speziell im regen da hat er sein talent wieder durchsetzen k nnen
5601575 deshalb denke ich es ist gut f r ihn wenn er sich langsam nach oben arbeitet umso fester ist seine position dann wenn er in ein topteam kommt

5601610 er is wel degelijk een toekomstig probleem voor de nederlandse huizenmarkt doordat hypotheken duurder worden door stijgende rente en hogere kredietopslagen ook zijn de banken restrictiever geworden door de kredietcrisis ach dit is allemaal al lang bekend ik zie dit verhaal dan ook meer als een publiciteitsstunt

5601639 we are committed to fight against those extremists and terrorists who are destroying and making the world not safe
5601640 whats very troubling for the americans is most pakistanis think that the war on terror is not their war its our war

5601650 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5601651 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5601652 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5601653 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5601654 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this

5601673 were going to get a lot of visibility from people coming into this area i dont think it will hurt
5601674 we have been working two shifts a day and are ahead of schedule
5601675 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5601676 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5601677 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5601678 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5601679 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5601680 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5601681 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5601682 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5601683 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5601684 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5601685 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5601686 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5601687 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5601688 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5601689 these thieves dont seem to care about their conscience they dont care about right and wrong
5601690 theres definitely an uptick you might call it a rash
5601691 this seems to happen any time the price of metal goes up
5601692 its very troubling because of the pain it causes loved ones and the disrespect it shows to veterans
5601693 as long as theres a place for the thieves to sell their stolen property theyre going to steal it

5601712 the participation of a major company like toyota is a sign that private companies are increasingly playing their part on the road to a low carbon society
5601713 after having relied on traditional ways of doing business for so long insurance companies across the region are now embracing it in a big way and are looking for new ways to reach out to their customers
5601714 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5601715 for example the issue of global warming has been getting serious in recent years and c02 emissions from emerging nations such as china and india are becoming a problem
5601716 it is important that india proceeds with nuclear power generation as clean energy

5601725 the e waste sent to mumbai chennai bangalore mostly makes its way to delhi as there is a ready market for glass and plastic in the ncr national capital region in fact wastes from mumbai constitute a bulk of the 60 70 tonnes of discarded electronics that land in delhis scrap yards everyday

5601727 probiotics are beneficial bacteria that you introduce to the aquaculture system to gain an advantage
5601728 for example they might compete with or inhibit the growth of pathogens and thereby promote the growth and survival of the aquaculture target species
5601729 the fact that the number of gangetic river dolphins in the brahmaputra has been decreasing over the past two decades was an alarming fact but now there seems to be a beacon of hope
5601730 our latest study this year revealed that the number of dolphins has increased by 15 since 2005 which is a sign of hope for us the number of dolphins in 2005 was found to be 250 but this years study found the numbers to have increased to 265 in the brahmaputra
5601731 with assam declaring the dolphin as the state aquatic animal in june this year the enthusiasm to protect the animal is even more boosted
5601732 moreover we have trained more than 100 youths in the brahmaputra valley to conserve dolphins and conducted numerous campaigns to raise awareness on the issue at the grassroot level

5601745 in the rainforest exposure to light during the day causes them to switch off but in caves there is no light to cause that to happen however they switch off of their own accord and they do it in synchrony
5601746 the most unexpected result of the study was they are out of sync with their surface relatives they glow most brightly when it is daylight outside the cave
5601747 the more we know about the factors that influence the glow intensity the better off managers of these sites will be in ensuring that the display is as attractive as possible while maintaining the long term health of the glow worm colonies

5601761 uh i dont think i can argue that almost cant follow it
5601762 because you have no case against it you must be a liar
5601763 well what if i was just telling the truth about being a liar then your whole theory kind of falls apart
5601764 you understood my theory even though you said you didnt at first so you are a liar
5601765 i said i almost couldnt follow it thats not the same
5601766 and then you said you didnt understand it after that
5601767 well i was just unclear at first but then figured it out okay

5601823 when you stood at mount sinai god asked who will insure that you will always fear god you should have replied almighty you will you should have seized the opportunity to request that god give you fear of heaven
5601824 it is proper for all those who fear god to constantly be in pain and worry over the destruction of the holy temple
5601825 any generation in which the holy temple is not rebuilt is held responsible for its destruction

5601850 masonry like all the religions all the mysteries hermeticism and alchemy conceals its secrets from all except the adepts and sages or the elect and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled to conceal the truth which it calls light from them and to draw them away from it
5601851 the true name of satan the kabalists say is that of yahveh reversed for satan is not a black god but the negation of god the devil is the personification of atheism or idolatry lucifer the light bearer strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness lucifer the son of the morning is it he who bears the light and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble sensual or selfish souls doubt it not
5601852 the blue degrees are but the outer court or portico of the temple
5601853 now imagine me standing in lodge with my head bowed in prayer between brother mohammed bokhary and brother arjun melwani to neither of them is the great architect of the universe perceived as the holy trinity to brother bokhary he has been revealed as allah to brother melwani he is probably perceived as vishnu since i believe that there is only one god i am confronted with three possibilities they are praying to the devil whilst i am praying to god they are praying to nothing as their gods do not exist they are praying to the same god as i yet their understanding of his nature is partly incomplete as indeed is mine 1 cor 13 12 it is without hesitation that i accept the third possibility
5601854 what will jesus tell the mason who claims to be a christian
5601855 masonry is not a religion in any sense of the word yet it is religious church membership is not a requirement yet membership in any church is no bar to admission there is nothing in the requirements of masonry to prevent a catholic a mohammedan a jew a buddhist a protestant a mormon or any member of any religion from becoming a member
5601856 morals and dogma of the ancient and accepted scottish rite of freemasonry
5601857 supreme council of the 33 rd degree and published by its authority
5601858 masonry is in every sense of the word except one and that its least philosophical an eminently religious institution that it is indebted solely to the religious element which it contains for its origin and for its continued existence and that without this religious element it would scarcely be worthy of cultivation by the wise and good
5601859 it masonry is the universal eternal immutable religion such as god planted it in the heart of universal humanity no creed has ever been long lived that was not built on this foundation it is the base and they are the superstructure
5601860 every masonic temple is a temple of religion and its teachings are instructions in religion
5601861 the first masonic legislator whose memory is preserved to us by history was buddha who about a thousand years before the christian era reformed the religion of manous
5601862 it masonry reverences all the great reformers it sees in moses the lawgiver to the jews in confucius and zoroaster in jesus of nazareth and in the arabain iconoclast great teachers of morality and eminent reformers if no more and allows every brother of the order to assign to each such higher and even divine characteristics as his creed and truth require
5601863 the true mason is not creed bound he realizes with the divine illumination of his lodge that as a mason his religion must be universal christ buddha or mohammed the name means little for he recognizes only the light and not the bearer he worships at every shrine bows before every altar whether in temple mosque or cathedral realizing with his truer understanding the oneness of all spiritual truth
5601864 masonry around whose altars the christian the hebrew the moslem the brahmin the followers of confucius and zoroaster can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one god who is above all the baalim must needs leave it to each of its initiates to look for the foundation of his faith and hope to the written scriptures of his own religion
5601865 everything good in nature comes from osiris order harmony and the favorable temperature of the seasons and celestial periods
5601866 masonry conceals it secrets from all except the adepts and sages or the elect and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled to conceal the truth which it calls light from them and to draw them away from it truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it or would pervert it
5601867 the blue degrees are but the outer court or portico of the temple parts of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations it is not intended that he shall understand them but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them
5601868 worshipful master the head and chief of the lodge the source of light of knowledge and instruction in masonry he personifies the sublime art of masonry and is the spokesman thereof
5601869 the first duty of every mason is to obey the mandate of the master the order must at once be obeyed its character and its consequences may be matters of subsequent inquiry the masonic rule of obedience is like the nautical imperative obey orders even if you break owners
5601870 the teachers even of christianity are in general the most ignorant of the true meaning of that which they teach there is no book of which so little is known as the bible to most who read it it is as incomprehensible as the sohar
5601871 all truly dogmatic religions have issued from the kabalah and return to it
5601872 the kabalah alone consecrates the alliance of the universal reason
5601873 the bible with all the allegories it contains expresses in an incomplete and veiled manner only the religious science of the hebrews the doctrine of moses and the prophets identical at bottom with that of the ancient egyptians also had its outward meaning and its veils
5601874 the hebrew books were written only to recall to memory the traditions and they were written in symbols unintelligible to the profane thus was a second bible born unknown to or rather uncomprehended by the christians a collection they say of monstrous absurdities
5601875 when the mason learns that the key to the warrior on the block is the proper application of the dynamo of living power he has learned the mystery of his craft the seething energies of lucifer are in his hands and before he may step onward and upward he must prove his ability to properly apply this energy
5601876 that which we must say to the crowd is we worship a god but it is the god that one adores without superstition
5601877 to you sovereign grand inspectors general we say this that you may repeat it to the brethren of the 32nd 31st and 30th degrees the masonic religion should be by all of us initiates of the high degrees maintained in the purity of the luciferian doctrine
5601878 if lucifer were not god would adonay the god of the christians whose deeds prove his cruelty perfidy and hatred of man barbarism and repulsion for science would adonay and his priests calumniate him
5601879 yes lucifer is god and unfortunately adonay is also god
5601880 thus the doctrine of satanism is a heresy and the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in lucifer the equal of adonay but lucifer god of light and god of good is struggling for humanity against adonay the god of darkness and evil
5601881 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit
5601882 we three do meet and agree in peace love and unity the sacred word to keep and never to divulge the same until we three or three such as we do meet and agree
5601883 assume a most powerful and binding oath inseparably uniting yourself with us and once taken it can never be retracted or departed from
5601884 having my eyeballs pierced to the center with a three edged blade
5601885 thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you
5601886 ye are even my witnesses is there a god besides me yea i know not any they that make a graven image are all of them vanity and their delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses they see not nor know that they may be ashamed
5601887 man is a god in the making and as in the mystic myths of egypt on the potters wheel he is being molded when his light shines out to lift and preserve all things he receives the triple crown of godhood and joins that throng of master masons who in their robes of blue and gold are seeking to dispel the darkness of night with the triple light of the masonic lodge
5601888 the glorious privileges of a master mason are in keeping with his greater knowledge and wisdom for him the heavens have opened and the great light has bathed him in its radiance the prodigal son so long a wanderer in the regions of darkness has returned to his fathers house the voice speaks from the heavens its power thrilling the master until his own being seems filled with its divinity saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased he the master mason in truth has become the spokesman of the most high he stands between the glowing fire light and the world through him passes hydra the great snake and from its mouth there pours to man the light of god
5601889 to any chapter of this degree to which i may belong and the edicts laws and mandates of the grand consistory of sublime princes and commanders of the royal secret as well as those of the supreme council of the 33rd degree
5601890 be thou a priest forever after the order of melchizedek
5601891 and the twelve signs of the zodiac the twelve fruits of the tree of life the twelve tribes of israel and the twelve apostles
5601892 holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens
5601893 the senior warden conducts the candidate to the elevated vacant canopy at the right of the all puissant
5601894 this is supposed to represent the end of the world when all good masons receive their reward by being conducted to a throne at the right hand of the all puissant having been purified by washing their robes in their own blood
5601895 a lodge or council of masons which the all puissant alone has the right to convene and open
5601896 is the image of a brother who is excluded from a lodge or council
5601897 that we should not hesitate to spill ours for the good of masonry
5601898 hath prevailed to open the book and loose the seven seals thereof
5601899 they the demons and workers from hell had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon
5601900 binding myself under no less penalty than that of having my throat cut across my tongue torn out by its roots and my body buried in the rough sands of the sea at low water mark
5601901 under no less penalty than that of having my body severed in two my bowels taken from thence and burned to ashes the ashes scattered before the four winds of heaven
5601902 than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed
5601903 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i have preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
5601904 all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
5601905 for if by one mans offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ
5601906 3d breast to breast that you will ever keep in your breast a brothers secrets when communicated to you and received as such murder and treason excepted
5601907 question what is to us the chief symbol of mans ultimate redemption and regeneration
5601908 answer the fraternal supper of bread which nourishes and of wine which refreshes and exhilarates symbolically of the time which is to come when all mankind shall be one great harmonious brotherhood and teaching us these great lessons that as matter changes ever but no single atom is annihilated it is not rational to suppose that the far nobler soul does not continue to exist beyond the grave that many thousands who have died might claim to be joint owners with ourselves of the particles that compose our physical bodies for matter ever forms new combinations and the bodes of the ancient dead the patriarchs before and since the flood the kings and the common people of all ages resolved into their constituent elements are carried upon the wind over all continents and continually enter into and form part of the habitations of new souls creating new bonds of sympathy and brotherhood between each man that lives and all his race and thus in the bread we eat and in the wind we drink tonight may enter into and form of us part of us the identical particles of matter that once formed parts of the material bodies called moses confucius plato socrates or jesus of nazareth in the truest sense we eat and drink the bodies of the dead and cannot say that there is a single atom of our blood or body the ownership of which some other soul might not dispute with us
5601909 come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you
5601910 this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
5601911 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
5601912 according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay that that is laid with is jesus christ
5601913 wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
5601914 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hat light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel
5601915 ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou has followed baal
5601916 how long halt you between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him
5601917 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
5601918 past general grand high priest of the general grand chapter of the united states
5601919 for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
5601920 i contend without any sort of hesitation that masonry is in every sense of the word except one and that its least philosophical an eminently religious institution that is indebted solely to the religious element which it contains for its continued existence and that without this religious element it would scarcely be worthy of cultivation by the wise and the good but that i may be fully understood it will be well first to agree upon the true definition of religion there is nothing more illogical than to reason upon undefined terms
5601921 look at its ancient landmarks its sublime ceremonies its profound symbols and allegories all inculcating religious doctrine commanding religious observance and teaching religious truth and who can deny that it is eminently a religious institution
5601922 all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers
5601923 you have told us that your institution is a religious institution we believe you but we would ask one more question is your religion christianity or is it not christianity
5601924 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed
5601925 if masonry were simply a christian institution the jew and the moslem brahman and the buddhist could not conscientiously partake of its illumination but its universality is its boast in its language citizens of every nation may converse at its altar men of all religions may kneel to its creed disciples of every faith may subscribe
5601926 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
5601927 behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
5601928 and if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me
5601929 he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
5601930 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth
5601931 philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us
5601932 we know that the son of god is come and hath given us understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life
5601933 whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father
5601934 that all men should honour the son even as they honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him john 5 23
5601935 is the god of masonry the true god or is he a false god
5601936 jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of these works do you stone me the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god
5601937 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know that which is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life little children keep yourselves from idols
5601938 be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters shall inherit the kingdom of god i cor 6 9 10
5601939 it is true that jesus christ is not confessed in the first three degrees but he is confessed as god in some of the higher degrees in masonry
5601940 now if you christians want to get together and confess your christ go up in a room by yourselves you mohammedans do the same and so forth but dont drag your particular views into these three degrees
5601941 the germ and nucleus of all freemasonry is to be found in the three primitive degrees
5601942 when a man has taken the first three degrees he is as much of a mason as he ever can be all the higher degrees are merely additions superfluous
5601943 all that may be lawfully taught in print of the degrees
5601944 wherefore brethren lay aside all malice and guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings
5601945 ye also as lively stones are built up as a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
5601946 and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world
5601947 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him
5601948 swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
5601949 he that entereth not by the door but climbeth up some other way mark the words the same is a thief and a robber
5601950 the common gavel is an instrument made use of by the operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones the better to fit them for the builders use but we as free and accepted masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life thereby fitting our minds as living stones for that spiritual building that house not made with hands eternal in the heavens the ritualist pp 39
5601951 the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
5601952 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
5601953 if masonry is such a terrible institution why dont other men condemn it
5601954 i do not believe it possible for a man to be an intelligent christian and an intelligent mason at the same time
5601955 i believe that masonry is an incalculable evil and essentially antichrist in its principles and influences
5601956 there are good men in it washington was a mason
5601957 what would a potato chip be doing here all the way from brazil
5601958 what does cheryl know she cant even sing they should get rid of her and bring back sharon the other judges gave us constructive criticism but cheryl was just horrible
5601959 cheryl should not be a judge she doesnt have the experience i think she needs to be more successful before being on the x factor
5601960 simon kept our cd so i think he recognised something special maybe he has plans for us i think he thought we were too good for the show
5601961 why do you always put up your hands in classes since you have no idea about the questions
5601962 the boy murmurs as if he were whipering to himself obviously he was much scared by the teachers request

5601967 electronics trends consumables cafe video games and movies all showed strong growth
5601968 there will not be a more impressive college baseball stadium in the country
5601969 when you visualize a night game coming over the river with the columbia skyline the people in the stadium will be able to capture all of that
5601970 it will be a setting that will be second to none
5601971 the stadium is what the fans are always oohing and aahing about
5601972 its about past players its about phil knight its about strikeouts its about cracker jacks
5601973 when we add the excitement and competitiveness that we are now known for in all of our sports to baseball
5601974 we expect the experience of attending an oregon baseball game to be among the best in the country
5601975 im not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
5601976 if you certify a union well simply find a way to close the related operations just as weve done in the other cases where union votes have passed
5601977 if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont get a vote on whether youll have a union
5601978 you know who i am and u know what i am about
5601979 there is a story that explains why the most important basic brown sauce in french cuisine is called sauce espagnole or spanish sauce according to the story the spanish cooks of louis xiiis bride anne helped to prepare their wedding feast and insisted upon improving the rich brown sauce of france with spanish tomatoes this new sauce was an instant success and was gratefully named in honor of its creators
5601980 they are ignorant of what is really going on and their arguments are therefore not valid as it comes from a position of insufficient knowledge
5601981 whos going to decry the expansion of the nanny state in this case
5601982 gas prices soaring in state bay area drivers see 2 plus february record
5601983 it will take away a symbol of hatred but the essential issues dont end with musharraf
5601984 its a virulent cancer that is eating into our society
5601985 the terrorists are not going to surrender they have long term objectives in the region
5601986 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5601987 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5601988 he should also be awarded strict punishment because he is a culprit of the whole country
5601989 in contrast to english the words for socialist anarchist politics and economics do not have negative connotations
5601990 the words for anarchist politics have negative connotations in english
5601991 is merely the application of the equations to static or incoming dynamic data

5601995 feels its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
5601996 theres a reason union membership has declined by half in the past 25 years

5602000 when i start deciding which laws im going to enforce its time to get another sheriff
5602001 thats appropriate just as it is appropriate to contact the fbi or law enforcement in other states when a citizen is arrested who also is wanted elsewhere
5602002 ive been doing this for a while and i didnt think id be super surprised at what was going to happen here
5602003 what he has done here will enable us to get our message out with a much bigger reach
5602004 michael phelps would be worth 40 or 50 million to nike
5602005 he could literally allow them to launch a massive swimwear company and i think you are going to see an incredible bidding war for him
5602006 we dont discuss contracts and that extends to future or potential sports marketing relationships
5602007 that connection will be tightened which we think will serve shareholders well
5602008 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5602009 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5602010 its an aggressive number put out there by an aggressive agent
5602011 but also eight gold medals was an aggressive number not a good idea to bet against the man right now
5602012 were trying to get this stuff out the door as fast as we can
5602013 im curious how you handle birthday gifts throughout the year especially for kids classmates and others who arent necessarily aware of the compact
5602014 its not about the money i do what i do because i love it and thats why im here
5602015 i see myself as a normal person and the same kid i was four years ago so im just living a dream right now
5602016 michael phelps is leaving beijing as a global sports icon hes now with the likes of the michael jordans tiger woods and roger federers and hes earned every bit to be in that elite company
5602017 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5602018 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5602019 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5602020 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5602021 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5602022 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5602023 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5602024 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5602025 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5602026 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5602027 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units

5602053 limpact sur ces marques va tre clairement n gatif elles vont devoir changer de strat gie
5602054 la blessure de liu xiang nest pas une bonne nouvelle notamment pour nike qui n tant pas parraineur olympique na pas la visibilit dautres marques pendant les jeux
5602055 aimer le sport m me quand il vous brise le coeur

5602065 one thing i have noticed each time i open your page is the picture of doug creighton
5602066 it looks like it was copied on a severe angle from another photo it makes him look a little skewed
5602067 i have used a few photoshop tricks to try and return it him to his original dimensions he was after all larger than life

5602071 i think he has done a great job right now
5602072 i have been here a while so ive seen when they see rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5602073 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5602074 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league i think we also have to put him in a position to make plays thats something this year that will be very important for us to get guys involved and call plays for them
5602075 the biggest thing for me every time i get an opportunity is to do great things for this team
5602076 most teams that we have played play coverages sometimes where they are not pressed and up on receivers like i said they are pretty much vanilla
5602077 there arent too many people with three medals in three olympics
5602078 i just started this sport for fun it wasnt even an olympic sport and i went to three games and now i have a third medal you know its all hard to believe its amazing im still trying to soak it all in
5602079 thats why this means so much to me im really proud of what i did and how i pulled through

5602087 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatised we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5602088 concerns have been expressed that the humanitarian situation seems to be deteriorating
5602089 will defend them at all costs against any move by any group that will disrupt our aspirations for a genuine and lasting peace
5602090 this is a consequence of the non movement of the peace process

5602092 why the muslims are not angry at this decision as some copts are
5602093 the majority of things that were done were done with partners our partners kept excellent bridges between their organizations and the montreal police
5602094 they have worked these past 10 days without rest night and day to ensure and to increase the sense of security which was affected
5602095 absent any further appeals we expect to complete the restructuring plan and note holders can look forward to the issuance of new notes and the establishment of a liquid market for them
5602096 the need to restore confidence in the in the financial system in canada
5602097 was required to consider and balance the interests of all note holders
5602098 theres a lot of money at stake id be surprised if someone doesnt appeal
5602099 the number of personal bankruptcies in the coming 12 months will continue to rise probably by 5 to 6 as the slowing u s economy will impact overall growth in canada especially in ontario and quebec
5602100 even in alberta bankruptcies are rising clearly a reflection of an economy that is losing some momentum
5602101 its just some moderation in the incredible wealth gains that weve seen in recent years that were driven by rising house prices but also strong stock market gains here in canada
5602102 the only time wed be concerned about the rising debt loads is if we have a significant deterioration in the job market or significantly higher interest rates but at this point we dont see either of those occurrences
5602103 the headline inflation rate might continue to rise over the next few months but assuming commodity prices stabilize around where they are or at somewhat lower levels the peak headline inflation numbers should begin to look a little bit better next year
5602104 dave you talk look like and act just like all the americanzas on this site if you didnt include in your profile that picture of you serving in the idf i dont think we would have met thank god you posted it
5602105 dave you got her its been a couple of months and your ego has been satisfied whos next
5602106 i knew not to blurt out that i worked at a nice wall street job or that i volunteered to serve in an idf combat unit i had to subtly work this information into the conversation so as not to come off as bragging
5602107 it was all about projecting myself touching an emotional button inside the other person and sparking a chemical reaction it was bottom line a game of conquest
5602108 remember positive energy is creative and negative is destructive here is your kabbalah lesson for the day
5602109 the latest statistics we have show that 20 per cent of canadians will suffer a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lives
5602110 the mental health system in canada has been so colossally underfunded that its going to take a long time 10 to 20 years i suspect
5602111 dont take it too hard about xiang lius injury with time comes healing and i hope to see him hurdle well in next years world champs in berlin maybe 12 7
5602112 he was very emotional about it the emotion of not having her there coupled with the emotion that it has taken so long to get to that podium
5602113 it sounds old but its the right age for the sport because so much of what happens out there is mental learning
5602114 this is a really really big deal for us when you dont do well in the championships like we have weve become a bit of a forgotten sport
5602115 he enjoyed the adulation of the crowd he seemed to love the applause
5602116 se effettivamente un licenziamento in tronco se sono stato cacciato
5602117 sono appassionato al mio lavoro che faccio da 30 anni
5602118 difendo le ferrovie dai tempi delluniversit ricorda quando combattevamo contro il taglio dei rami secchi di quelle linee che oggi sono la risorsa principale delle ferrovie su cui viaggia il maggior numero di persone i pendolari e che d pi fatturato
5602119 il servizio non pu migliorare e noi ci teniamo al lavoro allazienda e al servizio senza i ferrovieri e il loro attaccamento al lavoro le ferrovie non funzionerebbero
5602120 non perche ha denunciato lincidente ma perche ha fatto affermazioni false molto pregiudizievoli per lazienda perche ha dato lidea che i treni fossero insicuri che si potessero spezzare durante la corsa cosa che e totalmente impossibile
5602121 del resto de angelis lo ha ammesso facendo una sorta di marcia indietro ma il danno era stato fatto
5602122 aver detto che i treni italiani per problemi di manutenzione potrebbero generare disastri crea un danno di immagine ed economico per il quale andrebbero chiesti anche i danni
5602123 oggi ci sara molto probabilmente un ricorso contro la nostra misura e ci saranno dei giudici che decideranno questa misura ci e pesata ma labbiamo dovuta fare ogni licenziamento ha spiegato e una sconfitta per unazienda per il datore di lavoro e ovviamente per il lavoratore perche vuol dire che qualcosa non ha funzionato nel ricordare che ferrovie e un gruppo di 88mila lavoratori e 92mila se consideriamo tutte le societa connesse
5602124 e la piu grande azienda italiana che assume continuamente delle persone e purtroppo qualche volta le capita di dover licenziare cosa che non fa a cuor leggero non lo fa per dare esempi ma perche esistono dei regolamenti delle procedure e siccome siamo un grande gruppo non possiamo ragionare caso per caso discrezionalmente ma dobbiamo applicare le procedure e una garanzia per tutti per i viaggiatori e per i lavoratori che vengono tutelati sia nella loro dignita sia nel lavoro sia nella loro sicurezza
5602125 abbiamo analizzato molto a fondo questo caso e abbiamo visto che non avevamo altre soluzioni
5602126 un episodio ignobile condannato da tutte le parti politiche e giustamente definito da qualcuno autentico episodio di fascismo aziendale

5602141 the bookmakers dont rate norwich citys chances for promotion this season and one company has him down as a 16 1 shot to be the first championship manager to be sacked this season roeder is rated at 16 1 to get the elbow from carrow road although its another former west ham manager alan pardew who skybet reckon could be the first to pick up his p45 charlton boss pardew is rated a 5 1 joint favourite with southamptons new man jan poortvliet to win this seasons championship sack race iain dowie whose new role as manager of money club queens park rangers has begun with a win and a defeat is third favourite at 11 2 while derby boss paul jewell is rated at 6 1 dowie has been the subject of much speculation since taking over at loftus road with reports of a row with joint owner flavio briatore while jewells start to the season has been interrupted by similar claims the heat is on them both to produce given the finances available he is among the dark horses behind owen coyle brian laws colin calderwood and paul sturrock although he will be none too pleased at being judged on his rebuilt teams performances just two matches into the campaign
5602142 ledesma has great charisma and is a fans favourite already and rightly so because hes so great to watch such great ability
5602143 he was the most special player i saw when i went to italy to watch a tournament in the summer and thankfully flavio briatore then managed to get that one over the line and bring the player here
5602144 as for dani parejo you dont play for real madrid without being a good player and his set piece delivery was sensational
5602145 i think when you look at the quality of the players we have we surely should be up there but as weve seen before it doesnt always work out like that in the championship
5602146 its not always the team who have the better players who win the league
5602147 also the league should be harder than it was last year because when you look at the teams whove come up with big ambitions like swansea nottingham forest and doncaster and the teams who came down from the premiership it looks tougher than ever
5602148 but i think we just need to keep going and keep improving and at the end of the season well see where we are i think were capable not only of top six but winning the league
5602149 i dont think we played the best football we can play with the quality we have in our squad
5602150 i think we started really really nervously all of us including me but as the game went on we performed better and better
5602151 we have a lot of things to work on after this game but its always nice to get the first game over with three points thats the most important thing
5602152 i think it might be the case that big expectations played a part in the nerves but i think its always the case in the first game because you want to play as well as you can and sometimes that doesnt work and you get nervous
5602153 i think it should be ok in the next couple of games
5602154 the most important was the first game and fitz scored two goals maybe next time i can do something similar
5602155 i didnt go for corners today because they had three men up front all the time but hopefully in the next couple of games i can improve that
5602156 i was confident i was going to end up at qpr but i was nervous about how long it was taking
5602157 at first i thought it shouldnt be a problem but then it took longer and longer and somebody even told me i might miss the august dead line and that wasnt a pleasant time for me
5602158 obviously i was very frustrated i cant say that i fell out with my old club but i was disappointed at how long they were taking to resolve it but now its behind me and im looking forward
5602159 richard is available on a free and we will take a look at him in todays reserve game
5602160 we need another midfielder and he comes with experience so this is an opportunity for us to run the rule over him
5602161 daniel nardiello joined in training on thursday but we cant rush him back
5602162 theres absolutely no truth in it and weve no idea where these rumours come from
5602163 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5602164 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5602165 that the team is not about landon donovan and david beckham its about all of us its we its us its not i and its not me
5602166 if we work together as a group we can achieve things

5602171 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5602172 i dont want to mess with things right now i think its best that we keep our focus on the bears its important for a lot of guys to play well in this game
5602173 i dont want to throw anything off we seem to be making progress with our entire offense so i want to keep that going
5602174 its pretty bad when j t osullivan is outdoing you
5602175 just keep playing well and hes going a good job
5602176 has certainly give me no reason to take him out there right now
5602177 well work on situations hitting making sure our tackling is where it should be
5602178 basically we want to execute and give everybody a chance to get the feel for playing in the stadium
5602179 he was going to be ready to play on either side of the ball
5602180 i wish more of our guys would play like that up here
5602181 its not their custom to play like that in china hey thats the way we play it in america i like seeing it the old thing you hear about nice guys they finish last
5602182 im sure it was frustrating for him to see all the other young guys called up to the big leagues i hope he understands why
5602183 probably the most positive thing is to watch all those young guys get called up and not let it affect his state of mind
5602184 if youre not going to be called up to the big leagues its nice to have the olympic experience
5602185 ive never forgotten it and i never will that has been in the back of my mind since then
5602186 four coaches in four years thats not a recipe for success
5602187 when i came aboard we were as close to a dysfunctional family as youd find they didnt really believe in themselves and they werent a good team there were a lot of great players but they were individuals it hits me in the heart to see how far these guys have come its magnificent to see the human spirit and see how much a team can come together
5602188 i think were a team of people who could win we just were not able to take the next step
5602189 russia threw a game so they could play us instead of yugoslavia in the semis we were so pissed off we kicked the crap out of them if serbia gets that far well be ready for them
5602190 its my first time coming back here and playing in front of hometown fans and my family
5602191 that gets you going a little bit im excited and nervous
5602192 i came to a lot of games here as a kid
5602193 when they won the world series in 1987 and 1991 i remember standing on the corner waving my homer hanky
5602194 its a great thing especially with the stretch were in with no days off
5602195 it will be really nice we never get sundays off
5602196 i felt it my last start early in the game and pitched through it but in between starts it was sore and tight
5602197 i didnt think it was that bad but by the third inning every time i pushed off it was biting
5602198 hes a perfect guy for our team he can do anything and with that sinker hes a very valuable guy
5602199 obviously i didnt want it to be at that level but its the first time ive started every five days since 2005
5602200 i wasnt expecting to be in sacramento so long but i was just trying to keep the faith until i got another shot i have my spikes on and im ready

5602204 were getting close and today will be one more opportunity for guys to show what they can do
5602205 from there we have to create a depth chart because its time to start preparing for michigan state
5602206 its more a matter of deciding who will take the first snaps than it is a matter of naming a starter
5602207 these guys have been picking me up all year its nice to do the same to them
5602208 nothing worse than having a ball you thought you shouldve caught turn into a run
5602209 my stuffs been good its where i want to be in august
5602210 i think youre seeing a much more consistent barry zito a guy we know is a good pitcher
5602211 he was great i shook him off a few times but he got a feel for it toward the end we were on the exact same page
5602212 its an honor to be mentioned in the same breath as edwin moses
5602213 i knew we could do it we were talking about a u s sweep at the olympic trials we have a great group of young intermediate hurdlers i knew we had a great chance of doing the sweep the usa hasnt had a great showing so far we tried to provide a lift
5602214 i tried to see if i could just take the first hurdle but i couldnt i felt like i was on the verge of something huge
5602215 the only thing for the davids to do now is to make the podium and shock the world
5602216 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby sic brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children

5602219 thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoelaces and bad handwriting
5602220 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being awful at everything with no discernible talent
5602221 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5602222 its pretty nerve racking when a guy is coming at you 100 mph
5602223 fortunately i was able to push him out of bounds the second time he gave me a nice stiff arm
5602224 you dont talk about the loss but its there people remember its extra incentive to train hard work hard and were just thrilled to see them again in this kind of platform
5602225 theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
5602226 just like anything its not even necessarily a negative if you spin it the right way
5602227 we learned so much from last year were a stronger team now i know hopes probably very excited to see brazil as is the whole team
5602228 it has nothing to do with those shots that was 10 months ago
5602229 i dont think its personal for me anymore i think its our team wanting to reclaim what we gave back
5602230 we dont have that big name player that abby wambach mia hamm people dont really know us and our team gets energy from that
5602231 were trying to catch china in the gold medal count
5602232 im just happy my first throw was the gold medal throw
5602233 its an awesome feeling i knew i was going to medal then i won the gold medal
5602234 there are excellent throwers here who have been to tons more olympics than i have i dont have as much experience as they do its an awesome feeling to have the peace of mind to come back with the gold medal
5602235 i really hope it will set a precedent for the u s team
5602236 we need as many gold medals as we can get i was shocked when someone told me it was the first gold medal in track and field for the usa i hope its not the last it better not be the last
5602237 when i went out there i wondered who is this woman running around with the flag
5602238 its an honor to be mentioned in the same breath as edwin moses
5602239 me getting the silver medal in my first time in the olympics
5602240 i couldnt ask for anything more than to come to my first olympics and get a medal silver no less
5602241 its beyond words to have people in there cheering for you i made a lot of jumps and im feeling it

5602248 the point is ladies and gentleman that greed for lack of a better word is good
5602249 greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit
5602250 greed in all of its forms greed for life for money for love knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind
5602251 and greed you mark my words will not only save teldar paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the usa

5602286 promising research programs that do not involve the use of human embryos
5602287 in animals with two sides that were designed by natural selection to be symmetrical subtle departures from symmetry may reflect poor development or exposure to environmental or genetic stress
5602288 in many species these departures are related to poor health lower survival and fewer offspring
5602289 it seems that because bodily asymmetries are too subtle to be seen with the naked eye evolution has instead engineered more conspicuous signals and displays such as broad shoulders curvy waist lines or smooth dance moves to indicate mate quality

5602297 the roads themselves should be safer than they were in the past
5602298 is it people driving drunk is it people who have no license and maybe dont understand our rules who are dying and causing deaths
5602299 alcohol is also involved in a lot of these fatalities

5602436 dr brian day said sites that allow addicts to inject their own narcotics under the supervision of medical staff have been successful in curbing illegal drug use and slowing the spread of disease
5602437 we specifically take issue with the minister using that phrase
5602438 the minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction
5602439 its clear that this was being used as a political issue

5602446 traffic violator arrests will normally be made only when the violator has no proof of identification
5602447 state law allows the officers to and gives them discretion to arrest for traffic offenses
5602448 but this police department has clearly set a policy of saying no we are not going to do that and in both of these instances they did

5602499 gold star registry makes it possible to obtain the tools that will help students learn while also making it easy for parents and communities to provide meaningful support to their local teachers
5602500 while donations from parents or the parent teacher association are always appreciated the items they give may not always align with our most pressing learning need
5602501 in many districts school budgets simply cannot cover the cost of all the classroom supplies needed teachers committed to creating an attractive learning environment and providing the additional tools to help their students learn are buying the extras with their own money our registry enables teachers to get what they need without putting further strain on their own budget or that of the district it effectively widens the circle of support for schools

5602545 being able to plan a new school to work in close collaboration with a university is a rare opportunity for educators
5602546 it provides opportunities for students and teachers to work with the campus in terms of curriculum leadership development the creation of pathways for future education and training and access to education and recreation infrastructure

5602563 we are particularly keen to hear from people who have coloured slides from the l950s to the l970s that include photographs which show both people and the landscape including images of changes in land use climate social and economic conditions
5602564 sometimes the most evocative image of a place might be of a backyard with a chook shed an outhouse or a large vegetable garden we need to know the location of the photograph who took it and when it was taken
5602565 other images might depict the ravages of a flood or cyclone or a mine closure or other industrial episode that reduced a bustling settlement to a ghost town
5602566 the centre will engage the community in discussion and debate on the institutions and processes that continue to shape queensland

5602576 this is surely an indictment on customer data standards at any organisation that sends transactional documents all of whom want to grasp the transpromo opportunity but a section of whom seem to be undermining that opportunity
5602577 if transpromo is to be effectively exploited there needs to be an improvement in customer data standards two fifths of the population have received bills or statements addressed to the wrong person in the last six months which could seriously undermine consumer attitudes to advertising carried in those documents the opportunities presented by transpromo are probably very considerable but their effective use requires british business to make significant enhancements to the way it manages and updates customer records

5602587 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business

5602589 as an increased number of businesses express concern over late payment effective cash flow management is now more essential than ever for those sectors with rising input costs such as manufacturing and transport amp storage
5602590 we expect the slowdown to be at its worst towards the end of 2008 and into early 2009 we also expect inflation to start falling back from early 2009 allowing the bank of england room to cut interest rates throughout 2009 nevertheless overall the performance of uk plc through 2009 is likely to be the weakest growth since 1992 when the economy grew by just 0 3 per cent however towards the end of 2009 providing wage inflation stays low economic activity looks likely to pick up

5602594 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5602595 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
5602596 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

5602615 it an alleged threat and it is not true the government of sudan is a serious government and it is totally committed to its obligations especially when it comes to agreement signed with other organizations and especially the united nations and the african union im not aware of any threat that has been towards to the united nations regarding their very existence in the sudan if the icc has and the judges have confirmed the indictment of the president
5602616 i would rather say that the government is totally committed to its obligations and we have never threatened the united nations peacekeeping force here in sudan whether in darfur or in the south
5602617 in fact they usually do that not only in sudan but everywhere just in case because it happens that when the icc announced its indictment of the president of sudan some of the un peacekeepers here have been relocated outside of the sudan in case anything might happen and this proves just a precautionary measure and because nothing happened and things are going normal in sudan and now those are taken away from sudan the peacekeepers have been flown back to sudan
5602618 its because of that experience that when i hear women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and theres not the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad i get frustrated

5602666 in the past i always felt that the team was picked before we met up
5602667 but i dont think there are any automatic choices any more and it doesnt matter who you play for if you are good enough you will get in
5602668 fabio capello is very fair and you get the feeling that if you play well you will get in the team
5602669 its a very professional set up when you are with the squad and that is the way it should be i wouldnt say its frightening its an atmosphere of respect
5602670 its not like a boarding school its enjoyable and the coach will have banter with you his english is fairly good better than what you might think from watching him on the telly
5602671 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5602672 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5602673 i think he is settled in his own mind he has given a lot in the first two games
5602674 we are a young side and some more promising youngsters have come through for this season but they have all got the quality which you need to have if you play for arsenal
5602675 there are a lot of good english managers around but at the moment there isnt one who has been there and done it
5602676 the lads are behind him because of his reputation you realise his pedigree and what he has done in the game
5602677 he doesnt have to prove anything because he is a winner
5602678 you need a captain more in the bad times than the good
5602679 that is when you need someone who steps forward and takes responsibility

5602684 it turned out that way but it wasnt the initial idea
5602685 there was a deadline from the brigade to get the da through
5602686 it wasnt a monetary decision at first the da expired by a certain date and we had to get it passed
5602687 i suggest to you that you and mr sanhueza said to him mr guirguis that if he didnt buy the goods you would not give him any more work
5602688 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands
5602689 but asian nations such as taiwan and south korea have for years expressed great interest in japanese cell phones
5602690 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5602691 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged

5602720 theres been a scuffle down at the docks and long story short things are under new management
5602721 their time is up and they move into the hands of the state
5602722 but no private interest can be above the interests of the people
5602723 two notebooks filled with fresh creamy paper one lined the other blank six pointy pencils a soft eraser a box of new crayons and
5602724 yes well nicely done although i thought we agreed upon seven pencils but that is neither here nor there
5602725 would you like to tell me what you brought for snack
5602726 shall i let me see theres a bunch of radishes a tin of cream cheese three young carrots matching salt and pepper shakers lox on rye and a lovely vanilla cupcake iced with tiny sugar birds and topped with sprinkles
5602727 phase of his career remember when ronnie was walking around school in leather jackets dress shirts with no sleeves gelled hair and designer sunglasses that is how ridiculous the messiah looked on the sidelines last night stroking his prepubescent beard while smacking his gum
5602728 now beauty is in the eye of the beholder beauty can be a good set of teeth beauty is nice wavy hair beauty can be blue eyes or green eyes
5602729 there is such a thing as disposition temperament manners general attractiveness attitude and demeanour all those things tend to make a person attractive
5602730 returning us to the dark ages and making the guys that live in this town seem like sex hungry starved men that will pounce upon the first girl that they see walking down the street
5602731 the people that are coming into town now are coming here to work and find a house and live and bring up their families but with these sort of comments id say humph fancy going up to that place
5602732 anyone who moves to mount isa beautiful or not so beautiful they have a great chance to make a great life here it is a fantastic town
5602733 the defining challenge of the 21st century will be to face the reality that humanity shares a common fate on a crowded planet
5602734 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5602735 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5602736 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment

5602741 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5602742 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5602743 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5602744 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas

5602844 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5602845 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5602846 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5602847 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies

5602849 in recent weeks we have made our best efforts to find an amicable solution that could lead to a successful merger despite the willingness from tgs to increase the exchange ratio and change both the constitution of the board and the management reporting structure wavefield management was unable to demonstrate to our satisfaction an enthusiastic commitment to a true integration of the two companies

5602854 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth
5602855 prior to the closing date of bgs offer origin intends to provide shareholders with an independent experts report the report will include a valuation of origins shares based on all relevant information about origins value and prospects including the outcome of the csg monetisation process
5602856 shareholders should also be aware that the average broker 12 month share price targets ranging from 17 01 to 20 00 are materially above bgs offer furthermore origins average daily share price has been above 15 50 since origins rejection of this price on 30 may
5602857 the targets statement sets out seven key reasons why origin shareholders should reject bgs offer origin has an outstanding fuel integrated generation and retail business origin has the largest csg reserves and is the leading developer of csg in australia origin is well placed to benefit from rising energy prices and increasing demand for gas a csg to lng project may deliver additional value for origin shareholders origin has an impressive track record of business and underlying earnings growth bg is seeking to create value for its own shareholders at the expense of origins shareholders shareholders who accept bgs offer may incur a significant tax liability
5602858 origin has successfully pursued a strategy of developing a fuel integrated generation and retail business which has created substantial value for origin shareholders origin has outstanding prospects as a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with increasing exposure to growing demand and higher prices for australias natural resources
5602859 origins directors simply assert that bg groups all cash offer undervalues the company but there is no evidence or independent experts report to support this view nor is there any forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision further origin has failed to demonstrate any confidence that the coal seam gas monetisation process will yield superior value for its shareholders
5602860 whilst equity markets and energy prices decline and coal seam gas companies share prices fall origin is telling its shareholders to wait for an uncertain and unclear outcome from its monetisation process and reject the certain value of bg groups a 15 50 all cash offer
5602861 even though shareholders are being told to wait they are not materially better informed the information in the targets statement on important issues such as reversionary rights reserves and development plans is incomplete inconsistent and confusing origin has today confirmed that further information on these matters is being shared with prospective joint venture partners but still chooses to withhold this information from its shareholders
5602862 origin argues that its current market price and brokers price targets justify a decision to reject our offer however these are completely inadequate responses to an all cash offer which provides a 72 premium origin also fails to acknowledge that its share price is fundamentally supported by bg groups offer furthermore the targets statement fails to note that other australian coal seam gas companies which have announced joint ventures have seen their share prices fall materially from post announcement levels
5602863 origin has disclosed virtually no information about the risks for shareholders if they reject bg groups offer and retain their shares the targets statement provides scant detail on the companys development plans is silent on the capital requirements and fails to specify the considerable risks inherent in the as yet undefined alternative furthermore origin has acknowledged that it lacks the necessary liquefied natural gas lng development marketing and operating skills
5602864 write it simple as simple as its unfolding waste no thought upon the word and the letter and the subtle vain researches in what the force of the artists today is turned in to nought you are addressing all men use the language of all men there are no words noble or vulgar there is no style chaste or impure there are only words and styles which say exactly what they have to say be sound and thorough in all you do think just what you think and tell just what you feel let the rythm of your heart prevail in your writings the style is the soul

5602867 if a referee is going to make a judgment ok but it doesnt make any sense that everyone would come over spend all that time looking at a tape that provides incontrovertible visual evidence that a butt caused the damage and then the decision is to allow the referees first incorrect ruling to stand
5602868 the first concern should always be to get the call right
5602869 a saga of bad or poor judgment dereliction of duty total lack of governance greed breach of rules and law gross negligence and possibly criminal acts cascading down from the very top of aibas former administration

5603007 theres a fear in the oil market right now about some of the pretty dramatic news weve seen coming out of the united states spreading into europe and japan
5603008 oil if you think about it has got plenty of room to fall
5603009 this is exciting news for the site and the area in general
5603010 the ability to generate power at hillhouse will help us to attract more large manufacturing and process companies joining with those already on site and thereby securing solid employment for the future bringing more prosperity to wyre and adding to the vibrant business community which we have helped create
5603011 at a time when the economy is in decline the proposal represents a significant investment into the borough and if approved will generate power for thousands of homes and businesses
5603012 we wanted to show everybody what we were capable of doing and im very happy with the way the guys responded
5603013 i got a good swing on a curveball and got lucky enough to put the ball in play
5603014 i knew it was gone because it was a longshot
5603015 he came out of athens as an american sports hero and hes coming out of these games a global sports icon
5603016 we plan to expand michaels presence in other parts around the world

5603019 economische groei zwak is tegen een achtergrond van hoge energieprijzen en vertraagde exportgroei
5603020 owais is going to bat at number three for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at number seven
5603021 hes a high scoring quick scoring cricket player who plays cricket shots to get boundaries and i think down the order he was wasted
5603022 when he has played for us hes always done really well he got a one day hundred against india last year and has got runs this year and i am going to give him the confidence to bat at number three with myself at number four
5603023 i havent thought about the twenty20 side yet but theres definitely a strong case for owais getting a good opportunity to bat and play long innings for england
5603024 it was definitely useful because we got a side out there to run around in the field and to see the options available to me certainly from the bowling front was great
5603025 it was good to have a side out with seven of the players getting a bowl and it showed we have a lot of strength and depth
5603026 its key now to identify players and roles in the team ive identified how i want to play and its a case of getting the confidence in the players to do what they need to do and thats what im prepared to do
5603027 i want to give the guys a good run at it and concentrate on a specific role so when something happens and you need to change at least ive identified the roles the players need to play and they can just slot in and slot out its not a case of doing one thing on one day and another thing on another day
5603028 the england game is as big as it gets its just a sad and disappointing end to what potentially could have been a semi decent game
5603029 as soon as the fixture came out there was a major buzz around the team its a game everyone wanted to play in it was an incentive for everyone to do well during the summer
5603030 england versus scotland speaks for itself were not saying by any stretch of the imagination we were going to win but potentially something could have happened
5603031 is a testament to our interactive spirit our connection with the community our operational excellence and our outstanding staff members
5603032 we were very hopeful he would get a gold medal
5603033 i knew i couldnt make it when i was warming up and i couldnt even jog i really wanted to pull through but i couldnt
5603034 its such a huge pity he prepared such a long time for this
5603035 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5603036 weve been waiting all this time to see the epic confrontation between liu xiang and dayron robles
5603037 in my heart he is the spirit of my home my country
5603038 i feel so sorry for him but i really can understand when i saw his expression it was so full of pain it wasnt like he didnt want to run he tried but he couldnt run
5603039 there will be other opportunities i will not quit easily
5603040 i knew i had a shot at medaling here but i didnt know it was going to be a gold medal
5603041 im not going to be disappointed it is disappointing to know i had a legitimate chance for that podium my last throw i set it up i did everything i wanted to do and the disc just got away from me i just came up short its always a learning experience
5603042 i had a mary lou retton leotard that i wore all the time and i grew out of it quite quickly
5603043 regardless of whether its jealousy theres always going to be people to provide negative feedback i think thats what it is
5603044 im not even going to tell you what it was you wont believe it
5603045 were big were fast were physical and were very smart
5603046 john david is a very serious guy mark has more energy to him hes a more mobile guy
5603047 hes very well versed he has a great arm hes really a fantastic prospect
5603048 i dont know if theres a limit to the football taylor mays can play hes an extraordinary kid with unbelievable talent
5603049 i cant lie and say i never thought about whats going to happen after the season
5603050 but i think i realize i cant do anything about it right now i can just give myself the best shot by being the best player i can be today tomorrow one day at a time
5603051 people talk about it all the time that matchup outside the football team its a bigger deal than it is inside
5603052 i have to be very happy for everything the feeling for sure is very happy for being number one but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too it is a satisfaction i want to enjoy these two days probably but later i have to be focused on new york for the u s open which begins monday
5603053 i dont care what others say im only focused on my gymnastics i am 16 thats why im here if i wouldnt be i couldnt be here that is all
5603054 although there is a general agreement the motion has to be debated and approval of the parliament is awaited after it is convenes
5603055 the airline was asked to lay off staff and reduce the financial burden however we found that while they complied with the decision on one hand they re employed the staff on better pay both locals and expatriates we find there is some major problem inexperience in running an aviation company of this size or lack of exposure to modern management techniques or some other causes is at the root of all the losses we wait to ascertain from a fact finding body so that remedial measures can be adopted
5603056 the airline was to be under mumtalakat bahrain a holding company created to manage all government assets it was their duty to ensure that investments are made and optimum returns guaranteed if there is a hiccup in financial operations then mumtalakat would have to set right the issue and get it on track for financial growth
5603057 mumtalakat has infused funds into gulf air now it has to be seen what returns have come from there we will also look into mumtalakats revenue contribution to the government
5603058 we are answerable to the people and when we need information gulf air has to make the figures available they have been playing it close to their chest for some reason and all we know is that the losses are mounting these from leaks otherwise there is not enough information
5603059 she wanted to win and she would run so hard that after some of her races she just practically would lay down for three or four days
5603060 we are truly blessed that she was a part of our life and we are deeply saddened by her passing
5603061 there are so many people caring for me and who have done a lot for me
5603062 i knew i couldnt make it when i was warming up and i couldnt even jog
5603063 he is the most well known athlete in all of china
5603064 he is calm and charismatic he has a great personality and shows true leadership
5603065 maybe we put too much pressure on him maybe we feel a little guilty ourselves
5603066 its impossible to overstate the importance of liu xiang to the people of china
5603067 in the last four years he has been built into almost a superman figure here in china
5603068 the hope and expectation of the chinese people that he would win gold has been a very big part of the olympic narrative here
5603069 i think it will take a little while for the chinese people to adjust to this reality

5603079 all of these sites try to find a better way for users to navigate the web
5603080 based on not only satisfaction but also the volume numbers and the growth it looks as if google is continuing to stretch that lead
5603081 satisfaction is the best predictor on a go forward basis
5603082 satisfied consumers are going to come back be loyal and use these services more which in turn is going to generate more revenue for these companies
5603083 it gives them the expectation coming in that this is the way to search as long as google meets that expectation theyre going to do well
5603084 when you think about what we get out of search its just phenomenal how did we ever manage without it
5603085 on the other hand how many times do we go searching for something and we do not get where we want to go and we end up at a bunch of garbage sites
5603086 search is ripe for innovation in user experience natural language semantic understanding consumer experience

5603096 aku diperintahkan memakan pertama aku hadapi tapi sungguh aneh sesuatu yang mustahil yang tidak dapat dilaksanakan
5603097 wahai nabi allah aku sangat lapar dan aku mengejar burung itu sejak pagi tadi oleh itu janganlah engkau patahkan harapanku dari rezekiku
5603098 ya allah aku telah pun melaksanakan perintah mu sebagaimana yang diberitahu di dalam mimpiku maka jelaskanlah kepadaku erti semuanya ini

5603101 i think he has done a great job right now
5603102 i have been here a while so ive seen when they see rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5603103 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5603104 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league i think we also have to put him in a position to make plays thats something this year that will be very important for us to get guys involved and call plays for them
5603105 the biggest thing for me every time i get an opportunity is to do great things for this team
5603106 most teams that we have played play coverages sometimes where they are not pressed and up on receivers like i said they are pretty much vanilla

5603108 said liukin who on different days competed in the qualifiers the team competition the all around which she won and the floor exercise before yesterdays bars contest
5603109 i dont think a lot of people know whats going on right now
5603110 i believe its correct to have two gold medals three
5603111 im very disappointed in that consistently it was the same country i think this was a different judge i dont want to go any further with that want to go ask her no idea theres not a single gymnast in finals from there
5603112 i know they were both from australia i dont want to start anything im just kind of stating the facts
5603113 if it had happened in the all around i would have been more disappointed
5603114 the chinese girl did an excellent routine and the girl who got third i thought got a little underscored its unfair to her

5603116 it is painful for him but the pain is not in his leg
5603117 four years after athens his main goal was beijing gold and he has done great work for it
5603118 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is great expectation and a great pressure from all for the past 4 years liu xiang has been an athlete with great stability who never drops out of competition easily
5603119 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5603120 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5603121 liu xiang is a great athlete he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand
5603122 we didnt realize it was so serious and that it would cause the problem of today
5603123 we didnt want to tell people he couldnt compete because we didnt know at the time

5603131 iguodala is a major and integral part of our team
5603132 he is not replaceable the way the league works and the collective bargaining agreement works this man was not replaceable iguodalas option was to play for the qualifying offer and then become an unrestricted free agent
5603133 we didnt want to even get to that we wanted to make a deal so that wed have him for the long term
5603134 we made a commitment to the city and to our fans that we were going for an nba championship when we signed elton brand
5603135 this to me was a deal that we had to get done along with reserve guard lou williams who signed a 5 year deal worth about 25 million
5603136 now we have a nucleus of players that we feel real good about we wanted iguodala in a 76er uniform we were going to make a deal with him and thats what we did

5603150 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
5603151 and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5603152 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such a biological profile if such a biological profile did exist
5603153 its nothing as simple as he has the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing

5603197 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5603198 bei siemens gab es deliktisches handeln in gro em stil
5603199 es dr ngt sich daher der verdacht auf dass der aufsichtsrat nicht ausreichend berwacht hat
5603200 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5603201 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5603202 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5603203 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5603204 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5603205 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5603206 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5603207 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5603208 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5603209 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5603210 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5603211 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5603212 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5603213 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5603214 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5603215 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5603216 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5603217 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5603218 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5603219 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5603220 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5603221 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5603222 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5603223 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5603224 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5603225 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5603226 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5603227 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5603228 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5603229 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5603230 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5603231 hey maybe i can work this whole yearbook thing into tofugu as a roundabout way of telling people about a few fun japanese celebrities
5603232 school officials have cited the proximity of a state highway and the schools 30 minute distance from the nearest sheriffs office as reasons for concern
5603233 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5603234 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5603235 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5603236 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5603237 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5603238 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5603239 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5603240 somewhat surprising to us that ea agreed to change its offer from hostile to friendly
5603241 hey buddy thats a nice car but why not spring for a real porsche and get a gt3
5603242 i leave that car to the professionals its better suited to the racetrack if you ask me
5603243 ruling is potentially a huge victory for fox which could wind up as a profit participant in the film and could cost warners millions considering the films box office prospects however foxs legal team says it isnt looking for monetary compensation and instead wants to prevent the big budget film from being released altogether

5603247 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5603248 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5603249 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5603250 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5603251 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5603252 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5603253 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5603254 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5603255 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5603256 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5603257 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5603258 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5603259 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5603260 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5603261 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5603262 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5603263 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5603264 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5603265 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5603266 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5603267 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5603268 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5603269 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5603270 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5603271 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5603272 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5603273 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5603274 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5603275 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5603276 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5603277 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5603278 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5603279 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5603280 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5603281 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5603282 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5603283 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5603284 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5603285 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5603286 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5603287 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5603288 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5603289 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5603290 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5603291 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5603292 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5603293 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5603294 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5603295 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5603296 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5603297 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5603298 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5603299 it is painful for him but the pain is not in his leg
5603300 four years after athens his main goal was beijing gold and he has done great work for it
5603301 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is great expectation and a great pressure from all for the past 4 years liu xiang has been an athlete with great stability who never drops out of competition easily
5603302 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5603303 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5603304 liu xiang is a great athlete he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand
5603305 we didnt realize it was so serious and that it would cause the problem of today
5603306 we didnt want to tell people he couldnt compete because we didnt know at the time

5603314 if sadc had taken decisive action against mugabe long ago
5603315 they promised to come to some agreement in two weeks and they have not done that they have not even told people what the reasons are this is really a display of politicians collectively both zanu pf and mdc being extremely arrogant
5603316 if he wants to run the country he must get back to what has always been the way forward he must put pressure here and build a force here that pushes mugabe out so he should pull out of the talks
5603317 while negotiations are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on 29 march 2008

5603319 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5603320 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5603321 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5603322 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5603323 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5603324 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5603325 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5603326 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5603327 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5603328 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5603329 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5603330 such legal expenses and damages cant be predicted and defined beforehand and can be financially devastating for a company
5603331 along with the recent ipo boom have fuelled the growth of ipo related liability covers in india
5603332 for actual alleged or attempted breach of duty breach of statutory duty breach of trust breach of warranty of authority neglect error misstatement misleading statement or any other wrongful acts or omissions
5603333 an ipo liability policy offers companies an opportunity to ring fence the significant exposures in a securities offering
5603334 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5603335 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5603336 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5603337 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5603338 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5603339 just so you all know we did set a record
5603340 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5603341 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5603342 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5603343 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5603344 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5603345 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5603346 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5603347 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5603348 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5603349 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5603350 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5603351 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5603352 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5603353 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5603354 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5603355 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5603356 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5603357 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5603358 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5603359 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5603360 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5603361 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5603362 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5603363 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5603364 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5603365 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5603366 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5603367 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5603368 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5603369 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5603370 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5603371 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5603372 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5603373 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5603374 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5603375 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5603376 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5603377 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
5603378 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5603379 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5603380 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5603381 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5603382 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5603383 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5603384 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5603385 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5603386 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5603387 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5603388 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5603389 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5603390 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5603391 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5603392 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5603393 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5603394 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5603395 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5603396 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5603397 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5603398 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5603399 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5603400 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5603401 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5603402 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5603403 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5603404 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5603405 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5603406 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5603407 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5603408 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5603409 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5603410 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5603411 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5603412 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5603413 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5603414 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5603415 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5603416 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5603417 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5603418 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5603419 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5603420 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5603421 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5603422 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5603423 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5603424 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5603425 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5603426 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5603427 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5603428 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5603429 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5603430 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5603431 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5603432 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5603433 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5603434 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5603435 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5603436 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5603437 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5603438 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5603439 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5603440 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5603441 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5603442 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5603443 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5603444 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5603445 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5603446 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5603447 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5603448 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5603449 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5603450 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5603451 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5603452 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5603453 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5603454 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5603455 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5603456 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5603457 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5603458 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5603459 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5603460 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5603461 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5603462 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5603463 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5603464 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5603465 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5603466 satisfaction leads to consumer spending and consumer spending is about two thirds of the economy
5603467 if you have unhappy customers in the aggregate they are going to be less likely to want to repeat the experience of buying in the situation we are in today you want to encourage spending
5603468 not only did they improve but in apples case it is 10 points ahead of its closest competition and google is about the same
5603469 they are all windows based and we all know there were some significant problems with vista
5603470 i dont think its possible for apple to have a lead as big as this for long the other companies will retool a bit and come back
5603471 its usually the highest scoring automobile so it can increase its price when everyone else is going down because the companys value proposition is solid
5603472 as soon as you have the element of service in there it tends to get a little dicey for those companies to do that well is impressive i wish detroit would look at this
5603473 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
5603474 how do we recover discipleship in a tech hectic age

5603480 if you stand in front of a mirror holiding a dozen roses youll see thirteen of the most beautiful things
5603481 dont have regrets because at one point you were doing exactly what you wanted to
5603482 the character seems to be developing a little bit which is always nice for a secondary character
5603483 it seems like lorne instead of just being shepherds right hand man his military career is progressing so it feels less like a subservient kind of role on atlantis now and a bit more like i wont say an equal but a somewhat authoritative role so im kinda running my own show which is a neat way for lorne to go more so this year than any others anyway i feel like his career is sort of moving ahead
5603484 in all honesty im absolutely perplexed im absolutely shocked that just goes to show the type of fans that follow this show hes a minor character ive done a fair number of episodes and i try to do what i can with them im not always given a ton of material to create a connection with the audience but theyre really embracing the character as it is im just like man imagine where i could go if they gave me some more stuff to work on
5603485 that was the single best film experience ive had from top to bottom that show for me was so fulfilling and empowering and enjoyable im by nature quite a shy reclusive kinda guy i spend most of my time reading except now i have a son so that part of my life doesnt exist anymore but i used to read all the time that was it i wasnt very social and i dont generally hang out with actors that much but on that show i bonded with everybody immediately we went out the whole cast for dinner every single night and we shot for about five or six weeks and we were so tight on that show todd holland the director and rand ravich who wrote and produced were such a joy to work with
5603486 about half way through todd and all the producers from fox called me into the trailer and i thought i was being canned they sat me down and they were like we just want you to know the show wouldnt be nearly as good without you and if we get picked up youre on it full time and that was so confidence boosting it really boosted my morale to get that kinda feedback was such a pleasure then when we finished that project we were almost assured by fox that it was getting a pick up
5603487 what i heard the reasons why it didnt get picked up in the end was that the powers that be at fox thought it would fly over the heads of too many people that and the budget was a tad on the high side i think back then they were looking at 1 9 to 2 an episode and for not having any star power on the show they thought the budget was too high so they tried to cut some things and by the time they came in with a decent budget fox had gotten behind joss whedons project and really gone full blow with that and they dropped time tunnel
5603488 watching the show theres a scene where a bomber flies overhead and a war scene that we get transplanted into that was so fantastic the quality was so great when i saw that i was like oh my god if this gets picked up its going to be like this every week i got a little ahead of myself its the only time in my career that ive actually let myself get just a tad bit excited i was really looking forward to that show going and then in the end it didnt happen and i know better now maybe it would have found a place now because of the things are more along that vein but back then they decided to go in a different direction which to this day is one of my biggest let downs
5603489 yesterday for example my day consisted of maybe 15 lines of fairly straight forward dialogue and i got to shoot a machine gun for about three hours and you know for a kid i guess even for a gal too but stereotypically for a boy that is playing that is just playing i would never shoot a real gun its not my thing but shooting these things is really enjoyable it is the best way to get rid of stress its really empowering in a bizarre and kinda twisted way but its a lot of fun and to get together with these guys every day when i come to this show its so familial its so friendly and warm i could have like three or four episodes off come back and every single person on set is like hey kav how ya doin hows the kid hows so and so and so i think some of that sense of fun and camaraderie translates to the screen
5603490 when i got the invitation for the 100th episode party i was shocked im like whoa i guess it just sorta creeps up on you out of nowhere 100 episodes maybe maybe three percent of tv shows go that long but it does seem like my first season was just yesterday

5603511 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
5603512 were better at this than you people we have relationships where you often have none lets try to exercise the known and the knowable here so that we can bring at least some clarity to this debate
5603513 we have recently learned about british intelligence finding niger documents on uranium
5603514 we now know that there may be no wmd in iraq
5603515 well only a few people know about this i dont understand how you know clearly you do do you want me to talk about it confirm it
5603516 look 25 percent of us thought it was denial and deception
5603517 well well look for that one and well get back to you
5603518 hey these are the last days of this administration its over forget it whats the use of continuing the investigation
5603519 id bet my career on it everything was coming from those guys at this point go check this go do this some of it fanciful
5603520 well certainly in terms of specifically disinformation a lie they hadnt done the deception
5603521 but do you know specifically it was from the vice president
5603522 no what i know is it was from the white house
5603523 its ridiculous habbush isnt going to want to sign this thing hes too smart for that you know hes the intelligence chief of iraq hes a guy like us
5603524 were probably just going to have to fabricate it ourselves get someone to write it and then just deliver it
5603525 i wish george had more experience in actual operations like some cia directors because he could have told his bosses in the white house this is a bad idea
5603526 well actually you know this is not the kind of thing that we would do on our own
5603527 this is a golden opportunity we have a window right into saddams inner circle through the intelligence chief habbush we can put anything through that window we can put misinformation through that window we can turn saddam in various directions we even can send habbush in with a team to take saddam out
5603528 imagine then we could walk to baghdad instead of fight our way to baghdad something that could save many american lives
5603529 my goodness american lives are at stake here youre cutting off the channel because you dont want to know more and we have to now go forward without the advantages and opportunities that habbush might have provided
5603530 we understand this is classified but we have people here who are charged to look at classified information in a kind of lockbox
5603531 well give it to you when were good and ready
5603532 they dont hold water in courts when there is the issue of wrongdoing
5603533 this is my business youre on a need to know basis ill tell you what i believe youre supposed to know

5603560 necesitamos evaluar cu l deber a ser nuestra cooperaci n con rusia
5603561 no buscamos una relaci n de adversario con rusia no buscamos congelar el consejo otan rusia pero tampoco podemos seguir adelante en las circunstancias actuales no podemos mantener relaciones normales con tropas rusas sobre el terreno
5603562 queremos que los rusos apliquen lo que los dirigentes rusos han dicho que van a hacer

5603571 you can vote for republican in one race and democrat in the other race and the top two vote getters go on to the general election so we could end up with two republicans or two democrats in the general
5603572 so its been in court all this time and finally the u s supreme court ruled that was constitutional to have a top 2 primary
5603573 so were doing it this year we will probably be sued afterward by the parties again

5603618 i dont care if youre making spark plugs or olives you need a constant flow into the market
5603619 we cant build a market and then say we dont have any olives this year
5603620 compared to the last two years this is a pleasant change of pace
5603621 this would be considered an average to slightly above average crop and a night and day difference from the last two years

5603630 then their systems have been running without them the police the fabricated politicians the corporations we have been run by machines not by men the men have died and their machines lived on and we did not know
5603631 wed like to ask you a few questions down at central
5603632 thats for us to know and you to find out
5603633 but i feel like when we start telling them they have to do this when they didnt cause it that becomes another cost of doing business
5603634 we have many citizen groups who have volunteered to do this type of clean up just to improve the neighborhoods and the city
5603635 and weve had places like lowes and home depot donate paint for it too in a worst case scenario the city would actually do the clean up and just bill the property owners for the services
5603636 what weve seen is that once you have graffiti youre going to see more graffiti
5603637 that area is going to become less safe people are going to think its a bad area youre going to see more crime
5603638 some of the gang graffiti is real and some of it is just kids doing it because they think it makes them a part of something
5603639 but its all bad for the city and the property owners
5603640 i want to show people whats really going on and yeah you have a lot of enthusiasm
5603641 and you got some of those who just dont believe in it who just dont believe in the hype
5603642 registration does not equal voting and people register and they still dont vote
5603643 part of it will come down to actions of particular individuals and how hard people are working to organize people to the commitment
5603644 the samiti issues a strong warning to the state government against any such action and cautions that in the event of any such act on the part of state administration it would not be possible for the samiti to take part in any type of dialogue with the state government
5603645 the sidewalk dining issue is a fly on the back of an elephant
5603646 we need to be aware as our downtown becomes more successful that the crowds are going to get larger we ought to take a hard look at where we should go
5603647 the most prevalent threat to public safety in center city is the combination of overcrowding and over intoxication
5603648 when you mix in people drinking pretty heavily and the cruisers going by and no space out on the sidewalk the situation is set up for one thing to go bad
5603649 before you know it youve got a fight with 10 people involved
5603650 if weve got a problem down there its not 100 people eating dinner
5603651 last child in the woods saving our children from nature deficit disorder
5603652 you know im going to get a t shirt that says who knew
5603653 louv said last week from his home in san diego
5603654 i knew it would touch a button but i didnt know it would be this big
5603655 its one thing for people to say how true or isnt this awful but its another thing for people across the country and internationally to work toward reconnecting with nature
5603656 think of all the things we complain about and do nothing about
5603657 she said i felt as if they had cut down a part of me and i dont think that little girl was speaking metaphorically
5603658 she was speaking about a part of her humanity of who we are
5603659 so when we take nature away its no small thing its cutting away children and ourselves
5603660 research and markets announced the addition of ie market research corp
5603661 its hard to believe now with the sheer volume of new acoustic heroes banging on about the virtues of folk that there was a time when the whole genre was viewed as a musty old bag of bearded fustiness
5603662 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5603663 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5603664 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5603665 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5603666 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5603667 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5603668 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5603669 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5603670 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5603671 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains
5603672 this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
5603673 ok he is hot i want to fuck the waiter can i just say that
5603674 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5603675 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5603676 slomljeno srce krvari nisam upala na festival karijera mi propada oou kakav kraj
5603677 yet at the federal level as in maryland no practical long term funding answers are in place to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to remedy
5603678 what would your servant do what land are you sending me to
5603679 do we really need to see women playing volleyball in bikinis
5603680 would shorts and a t shirt really hinder their performance im convinced the real reason that womens olympic softball is going the way of the cassette player is because the players compete fully clothed and who picked the fabric for the u s womens gymnasts outfits yikes
5603681 i havent seen so much shiny spandex since a jazzercise class in 1989 just google shiny spandex and see what you get not olympic athletes
5603682 i am following with close attention and concern the situation in georgia and feel particularly close to the victims of the conflict
5603683 while i offer a special prayer for the repose of the souls of the deceased and express my sincere sympathy for all those in mourning i appeal for generous relief of the serious harm that the refugees are suffering especially women and children who even lack what is necessary to survive
5603684 i appeal for a prompt opening of humanitarian corridors between the region of south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead who are still abandoned can receive a worthy burial and the wounded may be adequately attended and that those who long to be reunited with their loved ones may be permitted to do so
5603685 ethnic minorities involved in the conflict must be guaranteed safety and the inviolability of their fundamental rights
5603686 i hope finally that the present ceasefire agreed to thanks to the contribution of the european union might be consolidated and be transformed into a stable peace
5603687 at the same time i call upon the international community to continue offering its support to achieve a lasting solution through dialogue and the good will of all
5603688 respect the traditions viewpoints and hopes of the peoples of georgia and ossetia
5603689 to collaborate with the georgian orthodox church in favoring peace
5603690 expressing our alarm and distress at the violent events of recent days in the caucasus
5603691 ive already been there i came and left in this very jeep thats how their intelligence works
5603692 the military is moving toward borzhomi and sachkheri and none of it looks like a withdrawal
5603693 the prize for the russian army was all of georgia not just abkhazia and south ossetia
5603694 all possible means were applied but it didnt work what is happening now is the bloody leave taking
5603695 its like a person who is leaning over a chasm with a suitcase full of money he cant jump over with the suitcase but he doesnt want to leave it behind either
5603696 our target was groupings of forces and military hardware on our first run the navigator wasnt sure that that was what was under us when we made the second run we were shot down
5603697 our tu was equipped for aerial photography we were conducting recognizance when a rocket hit us
5603698 we cannot have each city running around implementing its own immigration ordinance
5603699 im pregnant and youre sitting here driving in the f ing street

5603702 the coordinator of the connecticut chapter of the national lawyers guild a national network of human rights lawyers law students legal workers and jailhouse lawyers
5603703 ordinance concerning the city of hartfords policy of providence of city services as it relates to residents immigration status
5603704 the foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people
5603705 criminal warrant from federal agencies the hartford police department will cooperate with federal authorities in apprehending the suspect or persons involved however there is no legal reason compelling hartford police department to pursue an arrest based on a civil warrant
5603706 there is no general obligation for a police officer to contact immigration and customs enforcement regarding any person unless that person is arrested on a criminal charge
5603707 the belief that he or she is not present legally
5603708 was uncomfortable with hartford police department shall not do xyz based on administrative warrant because it is not their job or responsibility
5603709 screwed up border control and security so that passing these types of ordinances is faced in cities
5603710 uncomfortable with local government telling the federal government what we will or will not do with respect to federal government
5603711 he had not objected to any amendments proposed and had voted for them but wanted to be careful not to dilute the ordinance to the point that it basically serves no practical purpose
5603712 federal constitution allows states and municipality to afford broad protection to its residents and citizens
5603713 i dont think by providing this protection to our city residents we run afoul of our responsibilities to our federal government
5603714 does it matter if the warrant was entered so what if it wasnt and they ask
5603715 cant sue the federal government but can sue a municipality
5603716 my responsibility as a councilperson is to the residents of hartford im not responsible for securing our borders im not empowered to grant visas or political asylum to anyone let me set the record straight i am not for illegal immigration except for political asylum facing inhumane conditions but considered in context i myself am in civil union whose legal status is recognized by this city this state but not by the federal government very heartened by the fact that during the process of debate in this ordinance there were people of all colors all ages gay straight transgender all types of people if we had that type of unity in all issues our city would truly be the shining star in passing this ordinance it would be consistent with our practice for decades i do not support providing sanctuary for people who violate the civil laws but as long as they obey the law they will not be oppressed by the city and we should support a safe respectful environment for all residents
5603717 very proud of our city which has a pattern of welcoming everyone here and we do the best we can with our limited resources throughout deliberation there had not been a moral compass regarding obligations to all residents of city
5603718 but this is a problem all towns and cities have inherited from congresss inaction to put together a humane process
5603719 in these days of increased danger of nuclear proliferation it is more important that we remember the consequences of that august day so many years ago

5603744 the word of god thus offers us the opportunity to reflect on the universality of the mission of the church made up of peoples of all races and cultures
5603745 indeed herein lies the great responsibility of the ecclesial community called to be a hospitable house for all sign and instrument of communion for the whole human family
5603746 how important it is especially in our time that every christian community be ever more conscious of this in order to help civil society to overcome every possible temptation to racism intolerance and exclusion and to organize itself with options that are respectful of the dignity of every human being
5603747 one of humanitys great victories is precisely the overcoming of racism
5603748 human society has after all always developed from a lower to a higher level the sedentarization of human beings is part and parcel of the unavoidable progress of history it is the only way for them to participate in industrialization for thousands of years many tibetans were forced to live as nomads because they were completely dependent on the availability of grassland and water the chinese government wants nomadic minorities to have a real life ein richtiges leben

5603760 i knew she had a real good shot at it
5603761 its fantastic ive thought for a while she had a chance to do gold
5603762 it all sort of comes down to the moment throwing the discus is complicated a lot of things have to come together to make that good throw
5603763 we were hopeful to have a chance at that goal gold to achieve it is unbelievable
5603764 we gave her an opportunity to have a career i encourage other companies to do the same for other athletes
5603765 i would say probably 95 percent of our church knew how well she was doing we talked at our church on sunday
5603766 you cant count on errors at this level to propel you
5603767 but when you do get them you like to take advantage of them
5603768 all i ever ask of my players is to go out there and play hard play the game right weve been doing that lately and its been translating into some wins hopefully we can continue that
5603769 i dont want to mess with things right now i think its best that we keep our focus on the bears its important for a lot of guys to play well in this game
5603770 if something happens somebody gets sick gets a little flu bug or something well be fine im very confident in all three guys i like all three
5603771 thats the job that he was brought up here to do

5603775 i got caught up with trying to make things happen

5603778 we played san francisco seven times and we got tim lincecum twice matt cain twice and zito theyre good theyre tough
5603779 its the point in the season where youre going bad and youre falling out of it
5603780 youve really got to bear down and take some pride we had a couple games this homestand that were pretty embarrassing
5603781 we had a tough series in houston and to come in here and win three of four was pretty good
5603782 a lot of mental mistakes forgetting outs forgetting counts its everybody
5603783 i am leaving with the satisfaction that whatever i could do for this country i did it with integrity
5603784 i am a human too i may have made mistakes but i believe that the people will forgive me

5603799 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays

5603854 tesco and sainsburys must stop this punishing local pricing and play fair by all consumers
5603855 a tesco customer in banbridge derry or dungannon is being charged 2 50 more each time they fill their tank than a tesco customer in bangor sainsburys do the same charging customers in forestside or lisburn more than customers in coleraine
5603856 the consumer council believes that this practice is blatantly unfair
5603857 we are confident that the local customer is getting a great deal on fuel
5603858 as with the vast majority of petrol retailers in the uk including the oil majors eg bp shell and esso and other supermarket groups tesco does not operate a national price our clear goal for customers is to endeavour to be competitive on petrol and diesel in the local catchment area for each store

5603888 maybe some police spoke roughly but it was interrogation and interrogation isnt dancing
5603889 how can you write in the constitution that you give a person the right to profess a religion and then drive them out of mosques in groups of 50
5603890 without court order lawful foundation claims or searches and despite the objections and indignation of muslims
5603891 if a group of muslims prays communally at the home of one of them then daily searches of that home begin
5603892 we cleared it up as a mosque and people came from the closed mosques in town
5603893 they surrounded the building filmed us checked our documents and took our fingerprints
5603894 the police would keep rounding them up beating them up then throwing them out again
5603895 they found a shooting target in the mosque and weapons in a car outside
5603896 that you say 50 naturally everyone who goes there was summoned for questioning
5603897 maybe some police spoke rudely but it was interrogation and interrogation isnt dancing
5603898 its just that many of those mosques werent in suitable premises and had no documentation
5603899 were probably not just reading but conducting a religious rite but this is a state educational institution and a secular state by all means do that in the mosque at home
5603900 we are outraged by the actions of the police who in a blatant violation of the law have closed down several mosques
5603901 a mosque for artillery shooting what sort of mosque is that
5603902 we closed them mosques down only once they started functioning as political clubs and centres for training fighters
5603903 people believed it and we have no media to counter it
5603904 do we really need to see women playing volleyball in bikinis
5603905 would shorts and a t shirt really hinder their performance im convinced the real reason that womens olympic softball is going the way of the cassette player is because the players compete fully clothed and who picked the fabric for the u s womens gymnasts outfits yikes

5603917 there is a job to do here and i am looking forward to it
5603918 there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club but from my own point of view i am very focused on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch
5603919 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club nor has my relationship with garry cook and his team we get on really well and continue to speak on a daily basis
5603920 i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football and they make the decisions in relation to the running of the club

5604045 i sat up in my bed and i turned on my light and got out of bed and i was walking around my room and i walked some more and then i went to the bookshelf to pick out a book to read to sticky toes and i walked around some more and then i saw the steps so i climbed the steps and then i saw the water sippy cup on dresser and i drank the water because i was stirsty and it was good very good water and then i opened my door and came out to tell you my story and to ask you to please get me some more of that delicious water for me
5604046 they wanted us to have everything packed up by 4 p m
5604047 i dont regret it i would do it again im still hopeful that we can get a vote on a water bond and therefore we can get a budget resolved but it was a drill yesterday we didnt even have the votes
5604048 every democrat in our caucus is expected to put a vote up on the budget and to hold the budget hostage to me is intolerable

5604064 its about how troubles at fannie and freddie would spill over to the broad financial sector thats the big concern

5604069 its a win for everyone because anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5604070 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family

5604085 montre bien que la marque avait envisag la possibilit dun chec cause de la blessure dailleurs voqu e par la presse ces derni res semaines comme si lon pr parait le public cette ventualit
5604086 on peut se poser des questions sur les performances de ce genre de sportif super pr par qui ne dispute pas une course dans les trois mois pr c dant les jeux mais on pensait quil irait au bout m me sans terminer sur le podium
5604087 il ny a pas eu tromperie liu xiang devait tenter pas pour les sponsors mais pour ce quil incarne la fiert dun pays

5604093 where we have strong emotions were liable to fool ourselves
5604094 they accepted the decision of the referee and i think the issue is very clear
5604095 the most devastating loss you can have at the olympics
5604096 if it was up to me i would just drop the protest
5604097 im stoked with what happened im very very happy i dont want to fight this it is a gold medal at stake its a difficult thing to lose but you have to understand i came into this competition with the goal to win a bronze medal i went my best time and did better than bronze i got silver and almost got gold
5604098 i think what makes it special is hes so good in this environment
5604099 we spent the last year preparing hundreds of details in different languages and currencies and arrangements that needed to be made
5604100 and you have to fly reliable machinery this is a beautiful machine to look at its italian design and we did this without modifications
5604101 weve been through a rigorous 14 days but we really love to fly
5604102 a 73 million syndicated loan exposure to a bankrupt borrower semgroup l p
5604103 we have a very experienced group of commercial bankers working in the energy sector
5604104 the balance of the outstanding loans in the sector is a very small part of our portfolio
5604105 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby sic brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children
5604106 a first i must say felt a bit like elizabeth taylor
5604107 some of my plans and schemes have had to be put on hold because there is not much i can do if i cant walk properly
5604108 thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoelaces and bad handwriting
5604109 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being awful at everything with no discernible talent
5604110 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5604111 said liukin who on different days competed in the qualifiers the team competition the all around which she won and the floor exercise before yesterdays bars contest
5604112 i dont think a lot of people know whats going on right now
5604113 i believe its correct to have two gold medals three
5604114 im very disappointed in that consistently it was the same country i think this was a different judge i dont want to go any further with that want to go ask her no idea theres not a single gymnast in finals from there
5604115 i know they were both from australia i dont want to start anything im just kind of stating the facts
5604116 if it had happened in the all around i would have been more disappointed
5604117 the chinese girl did an excellent routine and the girl who got third i thought got a little underscored its unfair to her
5604118 im hoping to get that gold i feel i missed out on today
5604119 the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch swing with never say a word then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation that you ever had
5604120 buying books would be a good thing if one could also buy the time to read them in but as a rule the purchase of books is mistaken for the appropriation of their contents
5604121 my that dave eggers was certainly smart to criticize himself before anyone else could ill do the same in my endeavor to be a humorless bore
5604122 from the american point of view we wildly mis estimated him and we wildly mis estimated pakistani capabilities
5604123 once the government gets this behind them maybe they can focus on counter terrorism and get back to the business of governing
5604124 the civilian government is pretty divided in how it views relations with the united states
5604125 musharraf for all his flaws was seen as somebody able to manage washingtons demands in pakistan the civilian leadership is seen as all too willing to make concessions to washington including some that in the eyes of the security establishment are untenable
5604126 i just dont think that one person especially given the condition he has been operating in for some time makes that much difference
5604127 that is an opportunity not a liability but it comes at a difficult time
5604128 strengthened its safe haven in pakistans federally administered tribal areas by deepening its alliances with pakistani militants
5604129 now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan albeit on a smaller and less secure scale
5604130 it ends an era marked by great cooperation but unfulfilled expectations

5604133 it was unfortunate laporta had to go down because of things that went on earlier
5604134 if the ball wasnt cut off it would have been a bang bang play and nobody would have said anything
5604135 we do not teach that in china or in the united states
5604136 it was a low blow to throw at his head
5604137 i think it was brutal to throw at his head you can hit guys in other places thats part of the game
5604138 thats baseball but you never hit the guy in the chest thats an illegal slide the umpire should have ejected him thats where the game got out of hand
5604139 the last one laportas beaning really bothered me i hope the fans dont get the wrong impression of the game
5604140 if a referee is going to make a judgment ok but it doesnt make any sense that everyone would come over spend all that time looking at a tape that provides incontrovertible visual evidence that a butt caused the damage and then the decision is to allow the referees first incorrect ruling to stand
5604141 the first concern should always be to get the call right
5604142 a saga of bad or poor judgment dereliction of duty total lack of governance greed breach of rules and law gross negligence and possibly criminal acts cascading down from the very top of aibas former administration
5604143 iguodala is a major and integral part of our team
5604144 he is not replaceable the way the league works and the collective bargaining agreement works this man was not replaceable iguodalas option was to play for the qualifying offer and then become an unrestricted free agent
5604145 we didnt want to even get to that we wanted to make a deal so that wed have him for the long term
5604146 we made a commitment to the city and to our fans that we were going for an nba championship when we signed elton brand
5604147 this to me was a deal that we had to get done along with reserve guard lou williams who signed a 5 year deal worth about 25 million
5604148 now we have a nucleus of players that we feel real good about we wanted iguodala in a 76er uniform we were going to make a deal with him and thats what we did
5604149 it is painful for him but the pain is not in his leg
5604150 four years after athens his main goal was beijing gold and he has done great work for it
5604151 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is great expectation and a great pressure from all for the past 4 years liu xiang has been an athlete with great stability who never drops out of competition easily
5604152 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5604153 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5604154 liu xiang is a great athlete he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand
5604155 we didnt realize it was so serious and that it would cause the problem of today
5604156 we didnt want to tell people he couldnt compete because we didnt know at the time
5604157 i think he has done a great job right now
5604158 i have been here a while so ive seen when they see rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5604159 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5604160 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league i think we also have to put him in a position to make plays thats something this year that will be very important for us to get guys involved and call plays for them
5604161 the biggest thing for me every time i get an opportunity is to do great things for this team
5604162 most teams that we have played play coverages sometimes where they are not pressed and up on receivers like i said they are pretty much vanilla
5604163 the most recent attacks brought to everybodys attention that there are real concerns about the safety of academic researchers
5604164 we need a significant national coalition among scientists and others to try to get these acts recognized for the criminal acts that they are provide the investigators with the tools they need to investigate them and prosecute them to the full extent of the law
5604165 there can and should be a vigorous debate about animal research that debate however cannot be allowed to degenerate into physical violence
5604166 at some point we understand that not all forms of speech are protected particularly in the case of speech that has the potential to threaten the physical safety of the public
5604167 i knew that i would be punished some way somehow
5604168 i represent the same amount of people the speaker represents
5604169 why should my constituents because im fighting for them not have access to me in my office in the capitol building
5604170 its outrageous that any member democrat or republican of this legislature would force the children and the elderly and the disabled people of california to continue to suffer without a budget because of the narrow interests of their own district
5604171 we have spent millions of dollars ensuring that nicole comes back three times in a row
5604172 the way its done here is that if you are in the majority party and you are a democrat you vote on the budget
5604173 is trying to exert her influence and power in a way that i think makes her look actually out of control
5604174 at buildout this could amount to an annual exemption of property taxes to californias poorest county in the range of 30 to 50 million a year
5604175 we would like to be able to embrace your legislation but we are not able to support a complete and total exemption from property taxes of this magnitude that will create corresponding new demands for services from the county and our schools
5604176 when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace
5604177 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
5604178 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts entailed serious risk
5604179 are you going to set an agenda of change or one of compromise
5604180 youre feisty and i like that but youre wrong let me tell you why youre wrong
5604181 i intend to get things done as president that means that yes sometimes were going to need to compromise to get things done theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are
5604182 it is an extremely deceptive tactic and i think we ought not to reward the american chemical council by rejecting this bill
5604183 just because you have something that can be toxic doesnt make it toxic

5604190 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5604191 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5604192 this is a real problem with the bill excluding an entire industry
5604193 there was a general assumption that nuts and dried fruits would be included in this program they are considered to be healthy
5604194 it is not the intent of the bills managers to allow this program to provide other products such as nuts either on their own or co mingled with other foods such as in a trail mix
5604195 there are simple arguments for a single tyre and if michelin boss douard michelin is not aware of this he shows an almost comical lack of knowledge of modern formula one
5604196 this event illustrates f1s problems of incoherent decision making and lack of transparency
5604197 that is to say to your health the michelin tyre drinks up obstacles
5604198 how can i wrap up warm without looking like a michelin man

5604223 some of the big carriers tout their ptt services but they have the carrier barrier limitation of locking their customers into their networks and only the handsets the carriers support

5604226 it would be a nice gesture to those who sacrificed a year of their lives preparing for the 2008 dakar

5604266 i cannot so much as fill a pothole within seven feet of the railroad tracks when we get complaints about potholes on the lower spokane street roadway we have to ask the railroad if they will kindly fill them

5604268 we can try to engage railroad operators in a discussion of their signal warning practices

5604286 will fall again next year and be much closer to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2009
5604287 but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs then we will all be back at square one but with inflation still high
5604288 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come

5604294 when you are a young adult people expect you to put in long hours to establish a career to jump into the dating world and to build a life for yourself but they certainly dont expect you to be sick theres no such thing as too young to be sick that is just one of the many reasons why invisible illness week is so important

5604302 its usually the highest scoring automobile so it can increase its price when everyone else is going down because the companys value proposition is solid

5604329 weve had a president who is opposed to abortions over the last eight years and abortions have not gone down
5604330 taken to the soiled utility room and left alone to die
5604331 a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5604332 just because we think our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
5604333 you do not do evil to those who do evil to you but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness

5604344 oh dad you have known me for how long and you actually have to ask

5604354 the risks and the downside are really insignificant when compared to the rewards and the upside
5604355 es el gran fracaso de la anterior ley de conservaci n de la naturaleza
5604356 es posible que sean 20 las especies que cuenten con planes de recuperaci n pero el problema es que algunas como el lince ib rico o el guila imperial los tienen aprobados en castilla la mancha y extremadura pero no en andaluc a y madrid porque la protecci n es incompleta
5604357 ahora tienen un m ximo de tres a os para aprobarlos aunque legalmente se podr a ir m s all e impedir que ninguna comunidad reciba financiaci n p blica para conservaci n de una especie en peligro si no cuenta con su plan correspondiente

5604363 it is not surprising that a washington celebrity like john mccain would be able to collect contributions based on 26 years of special favors provided to individual businesses
5604364 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5604365 we had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us
5604366 well have another look at it and decide after the toss is made
5604367 but i do expect india to come back pretty hard at us in the second game on wednesday
5604368 they india have a very good side and probably will also play for pride as well they will definitely come back strongly they have a lot of talented individual players who can just change the match for them we need to make sure that we play the same brand of cricket that we played yesterday monday

5604377 no puede servir de excusa para que expongan gratuitamente su vida y su integridad f sica como se viene haciendo por parte de los m ximos responsables de las comandancias de c diz y algeciras con los agentes a su mando cuando se les racanea la adjudicaci n de un chaleco antibalas
5604378 en aquel control como en todos varios agentes no estaban provistos de protecci n cuando se ten an conocimientos sobrados de qu tipo de delincuentes se pretend a interceptar
5604379 las constantes negativas que se vienen dando a las solicitudes por parte de los agentes para que se les dote de medios de protecci n
5604380 quienes desestiman estas solicitudes tienen el compromiso de cumplir y hacer cumplir las normas de prevenci n de riesgos laborales
5604381 muchos de ellos no son nuevos sino que han vuelto a aparecer
5604382 es cierto que la reagrupaci n familiar ha podido suponer un ascenso hasta cierto punto de los censados pero no hasta tales cotas
5604383 en cualquier caso contin a estos datos son m s reales que los del anterior empadronamiento cuando exist a una bolsa de inmigrantes que no se hab a dado de alta

5604387 people thought gee is this pat robertson and jerry falwell
5604388 there are millions of americans across this country for whom faith is important
5604389 and whether they vote on the basis of their faith or whether they vote about issues that are somehow connected to their faith we should be reaching out to them
5604390 there are shades and gradations of what it means to be a democrat
5604391 were not all los angeles new york birkenstock wearing democrats
5604392 the top issues are no longer just abortion and gay marriage
5604393 people thought gee is this pat robertson and jerry falwell
5604394 we want people of faith to know that barack obama is a viable option and a candidate whos not ashamed to stand up and talk about his values
5604395 democrats have developed a keen awareness of the problem and theyre seriously engaged in trying to narrow the gap
5604396 that in itself is a significant change from 2000 and 2004
5604397 the 1st amendments right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the antidiscrimination requirements
5604398 remain free to voice their objections religious or otherwise to the laws prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination
5604399 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5604400 its a win for everyone because everyone could be the next target if doctors choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5604401 i am not so certain this balance of competing interests would produce the same result in the case of a sole practitioner
5604402 a new understanding of the relationship between humans and things as they work together to produce goods and services

5604428 er wei er hat dazu jetzt ein halbes jahr zeit pr sident bush ist offen f r einen beitritt georgiens zur nato was der nachfolger tun wird wei man nicht deshalb muss saakaschwili jetzt s dossetien und abchasien mit georgien vereinen die beiden separatistischen republiken die sich seit 20 jahren losgel st haben ohne die l sung der internen konflikte wird es keinen nato beitritt georgiens geben
5604429 saakaschwili glaubt es noch unter dem amerikanischen pr sidenten george w bush schaffen zu k nnen wenn der demokratische kandidat barack obama an der macht sein sollte wird der georgische beitritt zur nato erstmal auf mehrere jahre verlegt die nato kann nur staaten aufnehmen die keine separatistischen probleme auf ihren territorien haben es klingt wahnsinnig dass jemand einen krieg f hrt um in die nato zu kommen aber bis die frage um die separatistischen republiken s dossetien und abchasien nicht gel st ist kommt georgien nicht hinein

5604442 no permitiremos que rusia dibuje una nueva l nea de separaci n en los estados que a n no est n integrados en la estructura transatl ntica como georgia y ucrania
5604443 tenemos que rechazar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que estaban claramente encaminados a socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5604444 rusia no puede tener las dos cosas no puede actuar como lo hizo en la guerra fr a y esperar que se le trate como un socio responsable al mismo tiempo
5604445 es un estado que desafortunadamente usa el instrumento que siempre ha utilizado que es la fuerza militar
5604446 si rusia quiere hacer una elecci n estrat gica diferente eso es un mal comienzo
5604447 esto es un juego muy peligroso y quiz los rusos quieren reconsiderarlo

5604455 satisfaction leads to consumer spending and consumer spending is about two thirds of the economy
5604456 if you have unhappy customers in the aggregate they are going to be less likely to want to repeat the experience of buying in the situation we are in today you want to encourage spending
5604457 not only did they improve but in apples case it is 10 points ahead of its closest competition and google is about the same
5604458 they are all windows based and we all know there were some significant problems with vista
5604459 i dont think its possible for apple to have a lead as big as this for long the other companies will retool a bit and come back
5604460 its usually the highest scoring automobile so it can increase its price when everyone else is going down because the companys value proposition is solid

5604467 mi accusano di cose incredibili ma in che mondo viviamo
5604468 fisicamente non c alcun problema sul piano psicologico invece sto male sono incavolato non successa una cosa grave ma gravissima davanti a mia moglie alla mia bambina a tanti bambini non possibile che certa gente non conosca ostacoli non si fermi davanti a nulla
5604469 subito avevamo appena terminato di giocare una partita di calcio a cinque il memorial dedicato a francesco renna un mio cugino scomparso qualche anno fa in un incidente stradale gi non hanno avuto rispetto nemmeno per un morto
5604470 saranno stati in sette otto sono entrati in campo sono arrivati a due passi da me impugnavano bastoni spranghe hanno tentato di colpirmi per fortuna non ci sono riusciti indossavano magliette con la scritta odio bari hanno inseguito anche mio fratello gianluca poi spaventati dallarrivo di una volante della polizia e dallintervento di qualche nostro amico se ne sono andati scomparendo in un batter docchio
5604471 e stata unazione premeditata qualcuno li ha avvisati della mia presenza sono arrivati a bordo di tre macchine durante la partita e alla fine hanno tirato subito fuori i bastoni
5604472 ho mandato gi tanti bocconi amari dalle offese alle scritte sui muri ma come potevo immaginare che qualcuno potesse solo pensare di organizzare un agguato c da vergognarsi e poi cosa avrei fatto di male
5604473 di aver esultato anni fa quando giocavo con la juve dopo un gol segnato al lecce e ancora ho la colpa di essere lallenatore della squadra rivale dei giallorossi il bari ma stiamo scherzando dov la civilt in che mondo stiamo vivendo
5604474 gi qualcuno dovrebbe farsi un esame di coscienza spero che abbiano capito cosa successo e cosa poteva succedere
5604475 lecce la mia citt io non ho paura i vincoli di sangue non si cancellano vivono i miei familiari spero solo che tutto questo serva da monito e non resti impunito

5604478 were committed to chris as a big part of our club going forward if he shows he can play third base that gives us an option its hard to imagine a 2009 team without him in it at one spot or the other

5604481 were watching this develop hour by hour and making plans to see how we best approach restoration
5604482 we pretty much have our storm plan in place and we know theres uncertainties depending on the path and intensity
5604483 some of our customers will be affected by outages due to wind fallen trees blowing debris or flooding we understand how inconvenient this will be
5604484 our goal is to restore any service interruptions as quickly as possible

5604487 bottom line things have to get much worse to pass the recession threshold
5604488 there is no fixed rule about which other measures contribute information to the process
5604489 is to take the guesswork out of the recession definition
5604490 every recession since world war ii has included months that satisfied all three of these limits and there has never been a time in the expansions during which all three of these limits were satisfied
5604491 people are thinking weve survived 100 mile per hour winds whats 40
5604492 were making sure the soil pile is covered other than that we are at the mercy of mother nature
5604493 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
5604494 were just going to ride it out go home and drink some beer and enjoy ourselves
5604495 ive seen as many people die in blob shaped storms
5604496 this system is dangerous because people dont do common sense things
5604497 im still smiling after hungary that was an incredible result and a fantastic feeling i hope it will be the first of many podiums in formula 1
5604498 the important thing was that we showed just how competitive we are at the moment and moved further ahead in fourth place in the constructors championship
5604499 there is a great atmosphere in the team and we are all working hard together to move forward which is why it was so satisfying to get on the podium in hungary
5604500 valencia is a new race and we must start again
5604501 i did plenty of street races when i was racing in champ cars and in that season almost all the tracks were new to me so i have learnt to adapt quickly
5604502 it looks like an interesting circuit and its quite long so it should be a good show
5604503 this is the last sighting we currently have of the victim prior to the incident
5604504 the footage shows the victim is wearing a light coloured sleeveless jacket were you driving or walking along west end road at this time
5604505 any piece of information however small and unrelated it may seem could assist the investigation
5604506 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5604507 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5604508 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5604509 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5604510 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5604511 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5604512 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5604513 we are talking about pulling back to the territory of south ossetia there should be no troops on the territory of georgia
5604514 so far we havent seen anyone pulling out the russian tanks and troops are still around gori
5604515 this is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5604516 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5604517 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5604518 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5604519 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5604520 saya rasa krisis keuangan baru setengagh jalan saya ingin mengatakan yang terburuk belumlah datang
5604521 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5604522 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5604523 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5604524 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is
5604525 if you are muslim you cant buy a flat in mumbai period
5604526 i could not buy a house and so i think indian democracy is faulty
5604527 mizoram needs it more cut aid from bengal and give it to them
5604528 two children have been killed and two more along with a woman have been wounded
5604529 were going to lower the costs of cement the costs for building housing
5604530 its not to the benefit of anyone to have cases pending for two to three years
5604531 due to the fact that the life of the asylum applicant is at stake the examination of an asylum application is a time consuming procedure
5604532 this factor together with the big number of asylum applications pending needs to be taken into consideration in deciding how many more eligibility officers should be recruited for this highly responsible task
5604533 we try to improve the system but we cannot afford the financial and administrative pressure without the help and the assistance of the european union
5604534 they are better here in security than sleeping in parks
5604535 cyprus i had never heard of it before coming here
5604536 it is very boring here it is a bit like a prison
5604537 it is not easy but it is better here than in the city
5604538 here we have food at every meal and the hospital is near
5604539 a lot of migrants came for economic reaons and are told by traffickers to submit an application for asylum in order to prolong their stay or stay permanently
5604540 the majority of illegal immigrants or asylum seekers who come here enter from the turkish zone and turkey should be made responsible
5604541 we demand support from the european union in order to watch the green line and for pressure to be exercised upon turkey
5604542 qui n te ha visto y qui n te ve
5604543 negotiations here are you give me everything i want and i will walk away happy it is hard for us to appreciate the level of ethnic hatred
5604544 why are rolls more expensive in the uk than in german
5604545 and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
5604546 for what profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul
5604547 an individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of individualistic concern to the broader concerns of all humanity
5604548 te v a poner haciendo el pino puente en madison
5604549 the converters working leishmans powering up the columbias computer now i thought you might want to come down and have a look
5604550 sorry jadzia dax was right weve detected molecular distortion in the spaceframe consistent with intense subspatial stress
5604551 well im not prepared to make that admission yet i may not have enough data to form a hypothesis but my tests have ruled out several obvious answers
5604552 wormholes quantum slipstream vortices iconian gateways time travel oh and the q
5604553 something moved this ship clear across the galaxy i need to know what it was and i need to know soon
5604554 i think you might want to take this one its admiral nechayev and she wants a reply
5604555 all right sam beam me up ill take it in my ready room
5604556 no contacts in sensor range and all systems nominal though there have been some reports from the planets surface that i want to check out
5604557 the kind that make me think our teams are more fatigued than theyre letting on
5604558 a pair of incident reports filed eleven hours apart each by a different engineer
5604559 they claim the wreck of the columbia is haunted sir
5604560 i dont plan to indulge the crews belief in the supernatural i just want to make certain none of our engineers have become delusional
5604561 shes been on the comm with admiral nechayev for the better part of the last half hour
5604562 granted but keep it brief we might need you back on the watch for gamma shift
5604563 dax to commander bowers please report to my ready room
5604564 whats goin on is starfleet pulling the plug on us
5604565 we have twenty four hours to finish our salvage and head back to the wormhole admiral jellico wants us to be part of the fleet defending trill
5604566 the amargosa is one of five ships lost in the last sixteen hours
5604567 all in the onias sector and all to the borg no one knows if the same borg cube destroyed all five ships
5604568 if it was the work of one cube it might be another scout
5604569 then the invasion just started and were out here playing in the dirt
5604570 either way we have to break orbit by tomorrow so we can forget about raising the columbia we need a new mission profile
5604571 our main objective is to figure out how the columbia got here and our best chance of doing that is to analyze its computer core we could beam it up but then wed have to re create its command interfaces here and that could take days since it wasnt what wed planned on but if leishman and helkaras adapters work we can leave it in situ and download its memory banks by morning
5604572 and then we can parse the data on our way back
5604573 lets get on it before we leave this planet i want to know what happened to that ship
5604574 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5604575 as a coach i look at this roster we have landon donovan and david beckham as a starting point thats fabulous
5604576 i think we have a good group of players to join in and make this a good team
5604577 ive been impressed with the things hes done in this league given all the issues and the demands on his time
5604578 i think hes had a pretty healthy attitude toward the league
5604579 who wouldnt look forward to working with a great player thats one of the great parts of this job
5604580 i have a great opportunity in a great environment and i think we can make things much better than they are right now
5604581 we intend to win championships we know its going to take time and take some patience and hopefully a team that will qualify for international competitions and do well there also
5604582 i told them that the team is not about landon donovan and david beckham its about all of us
5604583 its we its us its not i and its not me
5604584 if we work together as a group we can achieve things
5604585 after eight or nine months away from the game i was looking forward to getting back into it
5604586 at least parents should know that congress has done a lot to protect their children
5604587 there will be real changes that will impact the safety of products as a mom and as someone who has dedicated months of my life to this that is really heartening
5604588 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5604589 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5604590 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5604591 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5604592 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5604593 the fundamental question i have for is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5604594 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5604595 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5604596 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain
5604597 our emphasis on opportunity and responsibility will succeed where their top down state control has failed
5604598 first it was change then it was aspiration and earlier this year it was all about government being on your side
5604599 que el pueblo cruce o est seguro de que nosotros evitaremos la llegada de los ministros a santa cruz porque no son bienvenidos
5604600 ya no somos un simple gobierno sino el poder del pueblo
5604601 el debate no debe pasar de la pr xima semana si es ley es ley si es decreto es decreto la nueva constituci n debe ser aprobada y vamos a hacerla aprobar
5604602 ya tenemos identificados los nombres de las personas encabezadas por costas y el presidente c vico branko marinkovic les vamos a hacer juicio porque eso corresponde estas personas han agredido a polic as y a jefes policiales
5604603 golpe a polic as ese delincuente que tiene antecedentes por narcotr fico tendr que responder
5604604 perro de la guerra ngel de la muerte sinverg enza servil
5604605 una reuni n para que nosotros los polic as tomemos alg n tipo de determinaci n ante este tipo de agresiones debemos dar respaldo a nuestros camaradas somos una polic a revolucionaria no tenemos miedo
5604606 si uno hablaba de anomia o de desidia hablaba de hombres no de la instituci n era muy importante que la fuerza no quedara manchada era todo un desaf o para el ministerio y para la federal y creemos que hemos cumplido era nuestro deber pero nos hac a sentir muy mal
5604607 hab a una instrucci n del juez del 25 de junio para que fuera retirado por el spf y se profug un mes despu s el 26 de julio por esa raz n hay un sumario en el servicio penitenciario para ver qui n fue el responsable de no practicar ese traslado
5604608 una resoluci n por la cual de ahora en m s los traslados deben producirse dentro de las 48 horas para que no nos vuelva a pasar
5604609 no estamos de acuerdo con que haya ning n detenido en las fuerzas de seguridad no tienen que hacer esa tarea los calabozos son para contraventores
5604610 el juez com a en casa del comisario y viceversa la mujer del comisario le hizo la fiesta de cumplea os a corres
5604611 estaba tratando de cruzar el puente cuando un soldado ruso en el puesto de control abri fuego sin motivo le dispar dos veces en el pecho y una vez en la cabeza lo enterramos el mismo d a mi padre muri luchando para el ej rcito rojo durante la segunda guerra y yo mismo serv como guardia sovi tico en la frontera turca nunca le hice da o a rusia por qu asesinaron a mi hijo
5604612 hemos venido de nuestro pueblo que queda a ocho kil metros de aqu y que fue destruido miren esto se puede vivir de esto en el siglo xxi gracias a dios que los rusos no dejaron entrar a los osetios pero d nde est el ej rcito y el gobierno georgianos los rusos est n paseando en tanques por nuestra ciudad
5604613 no creemos que se haya acabado el problema a la noche podemos o r disparos en las reas circundantes necesitamos fuerzas internacionales aqu tan pronto como sea posible
5604614 estamos exhaustos y no tenemos suficientes insumos no s qu haremos si aparecen m s pacientes
5604615 abuso deshonesto agravado reiterado y corrupci n de menores agravada
5604616 en protecci n de la moral e intimidad de los testigos y el inter s de la justicia
5604617 m s dirigida a proteger al imputado que a las v ctimas
5604618 se trata de una causa armada por periodistas del canal 13 que se han convertido en fiscales sobre la base de argumentos y pruebas falsas
5604619 mi se ora rosal a schulls que ten a 37 a os fumigaba los galpones sin ninguna protecci n en la nariz y la boca y eso le provoc la muerte
5604620 estoy feliz en beijing y tratar de ver todos los deportes posibles del partido de hoy por ayer me gust el coraz n que pusieron los muchachos
5604621 agradezco mucho la presencia de maradona est siempre en los grandes eventos deportivos de argentinos en la copa davis en los juegos ol mpicos y en los partidos de f tbol ahora se hizo 20 mil kil metros para estar ac y por suerte le pudimos regalar un triunfo
5604622 la presencia de diego motiv a los muchachos que no lo conoc an quisieron hacer las cosas mejor pero para m que ya lo conoc a fue un partido m s
5604623 nos vino bien que rusia nos jugara con todo as llegamos bien entrenados a jugar contra grecia que es lo que vale
5604624 me cost concentrarme en el partido no nos jug bamos mucho y me cuesta jugar sin adrenalina pero eso me pasa a m se nota que a scola y nocioni no les pas lo mismo
5604625 ser dif cil grecia es un gran equipo pero argentina hizo una gran primera fase
5604626 yo creo que no van a salir atacarnos y que nos van a esperar no tengo dudas de eso veremos qu es lo que pasa pero todos estamos convencidos de eso nosotros tenemos que ser inteligentes me gusta que mis equipos propongan pero tampoco vamos a ser inocentes en el sentido de salir a lo loco a buscarlos ellos tambi n tienen la obligaci n
5604627 brasil saldr a defenderse lo hizo en belo horizonte y lo har ac tambi n nosotros tenemos que ser lo suficientemente inteligentes como para poder ganar el partido
5604628 sabemos que seguramente para todos tendr m s valor la medalla si les ganamos a los brasile os pero nosotros lo que queremos es la medalla de oro m s all de los rivales que nos toque enfrentar
5604629 en los 90 nosotros les gan bamos siempre son rachas que hay en el f tbol despu s cambi no tomamos esto como una venganza porque no venimos a vengar nada sino a ganar la medalla de oro
5604630 hemos venido a china como los campeones que defienden la medalla y la intenci n es ganarla ser a lo m s lindo del mundo sabemos que con brasil hay una rivalidad desde siempre en los ltimos partidos contra ellos no nos ha ido bien pero tenemos un gran equipo
5604631 estamos muy confiados en poder ganarle a brasil porque argentina tiene lo suyo seguro que nosotros los respetamos como ellos nos respetan a nosotros pero confiamos en poder llegar a la final
5604632 brasil es el cl sico rival y este es el partido m s importante para los argentinos estamos mentalizados en hacer bien las cosas y vamos a dejar todo para conseguir el resultado que necesitamos
5604633 el tema es que al seleccionado argentino lo respetan mucho todos los equipos por eso no creo que brasil salga a atacarnos
5604634 yo creo que el plantel de ellos ser mezquino porque nadie sale a atacar a argentina algo que qued demostrado en estos juegos ol mpicos
5604635 hay que decir que a veces se hace muy dif cil entrarles a equipos que salen a defenderse con los once jugadores detr s de la l nea de la pelota porque es desgastante y m s teniendo en cuenta el clima que hay ac que es muy pesado y por momentos te deja sin aire
5604636 es cierto que los dos vamos a llegar cansados pero eso no creo que se sienta porque jugar contra brasil es muy especial y es el partido que todos queremos ganar ojal se pueda dar
5604637 desde 2003 ven amos efectuando pedidos a la anses y efectuando reuniones con funcionarios en procura de este resultado
5604638 estamos muy contentos pero la soluci n de fondo s lo podr venir de la mano de la aprobaci n de la ley de matrimonio
5604639 reconocer el derecho a la pensi n por viudez a las personas del mismo sexo al igual que lo reconoce para los convivientes de distinto sexo sin necesidad de recurrir a la justicia
5604640 es un paso muy importante coment mar a rachid titular de la fglbt lo reclam bamos desde hac a mucho y ya hac a un a o el inadi hab a sostenido que la interpretaci n que hac a la anses era discriminatoria
5604641 esta semana la c mara de diputados tratar un proyecto de ley que garantiza a nivel nacional que las obras sociales cubran a parejas del mismo sexo en igualdad de condiciones con las de distinto sexo anunci rachid el texto unifica varios que hab an sido presentados tiene dictamen favorable en comisiones y es apoyado por las principales bancadas
5604642 estos avances no hacen m s que reconocer derechos puntuales y el camino hacia la igualdad jur dica requiere la aprobaci n del derecho al matrimonio
5604643 las medidas puntuales no modifican una discriminaci n b sica que se expresa de muchas maneras as la mayor a de los hospitales s lo permiten para pacientes en terapia intensiva visitas de familiares directos lo cual puede excluir a una pareja del mismo sexo
5604644 nada de esto ser suficiente si no hay una decisi n pol tica del ejecutivo nacional como la que tom en espa a el presidente jos luis rodr guez zapatero
5604645 el inadi considera discriminatoria la falta de una ley que garantice el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo
5604646 porque de ah saca la informaci n para posicionarse pol ticamente
5604647 en todos los temas que ingresen al congreso en los pr ximos tiempos puede haber pol mica por la actitud de oposici n
5604648 si nosotros hubi ramos planteado la creaci n de una empresa nueva ellos habr an propuesto la expropiaci n
5604649 no estamos dispuestos a rubricar la trampa del acuerdo entre el gobierno argentino y el de espa a con los empresarios espa oles facilitado por la actitud que han tomado muchos dirigentes sindicales
5604650 si los empresarios espa oles de marsans est n contentos el pueblo argentino tiene mucho de qu preocuparse
5604651 si ellos quieren tratar el proyecto el jueves nosotros no daremos qu rum esa ser una responsabilidad con la que deber n cargar ellos
5604652 vamos a tomar las plantas cementeras esta medianoche porque se acab el plazo y pasan a manos del estado
5604653 como pas con la sider rgica del orinoco sidor como pas con la faja del orinoco como pas con la compa a de tel fonos de venezuela todo eso son pasos al socialismo
5604654 el gobierno no para ni parar mientras yo est aqu con el favor de dios y el apoyo de ustedes venezuela marchar por el camino de la igualdad de la justicia social y del socialismo
5604655 la ley es bien clara dice que al vencer el plazo se procede a la expropiaci n nosotros iremos con todo el respeto a las leyes y el cumplimiento de las normas a tomar el control de esa planta
5604656 hemos concretado una negociaci n exitosa con dos de las tres empresas que eran objeto del decreto de nacionalizaci n a este acuerdo se ha llegado una vez que se ha iniciado un proceso transparente de negociaci n de las empresas
5604657 en plena vigencia de las instituciones de la rep blica resulta problem tico que un ex funcionario de la dictadura genocida ocupe un cargo de juez
5604658 cassanello fue intendente de quilmes desde el 1 de octubre de 1979 hasta fines de 1982 y como tal es responsable de todo el accionar represivo cometido all y por tal de la desaparici n de francisco romeo barreta en junio de 1980 y de lindolfo pablo g mez el 11 de junio de 1981
5604659 la representaci n ol mpica oficial de los atletas argentinos ante el mundo debe ser ejercida por una persona cuya trayectoria demuestre el respeto por los derechos humanos y democr ticos
5604660 parecer a que todos se enteraran ahora de lo que es cassanello pero esto deber a haberse hecho mucho antes las federaciones deportivas que lo votaron son culpables de lo que pasa
5604661 hay que contar tubo por tubo y en dos meses fijaremos el precio definitivo
5604662 la centralidad del estado en la garant a del financiamiento para el conjunto de la educaci n superior en la provisi n de sus recursos indispensables con especial nfasis en la infraestructura edilicia y los materiales did cticos vinculados a las nuevas tecnolog as en la orientaci n de pol ticas de calidad y excelencia
5604663 la necesidad de incrementar el aporte privado para la docencia y la investigaci n
5604664 la especificidad de cada sector es decir que no se privaticen los espacios p blicos y que al mismo tiempo se respete a los privados en el marco de la constituci n y la ley de educaci n nacional y la gratuidad de los estudios de grado en las universidades estatales
5604665 son bienes p blicos y constituyen derechos personales y sociales no pueden ser servicios lucrativos o estar sujetos a cualquier forma de mercantilizaci n
5604666 la defensa de la autonom a y la autarqu a se visualiza como compatible con las concepciones modernas e integrales del estado la autonom a y la autarqu a deben ser ejercidas de manera responsable primando el inter s com n y rechazando la autonom a de mercado
5604667 el sistema de educaci n superior debe integrarse estructuralmente a la producci n a la investigaci n cient fica la tecnol gica y de innovaci n productiva as como al conjunto de los niveles y modalidades educativas para ello debe articular la docencia con las investigaciones y desarrollos tecnol gicos y productivos vinculados con prioridades del desarrollo nacional
5604668 garantizar el acceso por concurso a los cargos docentes en todas las universidades e instituciones de educaci n superior establecer una carrera docente vinculada con la formaci n capacitaci n actualizaci n y evaluaci n permanente e impulsar la investigaci n cient fica y tecnol gica as como la innovaci n en pedagog a de la educaci n superior para mejorar los procesos de ense anza
5604669 donde hubo m s de tres kil metros de cola de veh culos
5604670 las colas de autom viles se formaron en ambos sentidos de la carretera en su mayor a de personas que regresaban del fin de semana largo
5604671 durante la ma ana la visibilidad fue nula como consecuencia de las densas columnas de humo provenientes de la quema de pastizales en la isla talavera
5604672 es una l stima se est dialogando con la secretar a de agricultura con los gobernadores hay que tener paciencia
5604673 yo creo que en alg n momento va a haber cambios pero no esta semana
5604674 al segundo centenario de la independencia deber amos llegar con ideas claras para refundar nuestras rep blicas modificar nuestras formas de representaci n pol tica y nuestras pol ticas pedag gicas
5604675 esto es una especie de sem foro amarillo confi un dirigente agrario si no fuera as ac no habr a 4 mil personas presentes hoy ser amos apenas doscientos
5604676 llevamos un mes desde la eliminaci n de la resoluci n 125 arranc el ruralista y cuando recorr amos el congreso vimos muchos senadores nacionales con muchos proyectos varios que estaban dando vueltas porque muchos de ellos sab an que era nefasta la 125 pero nosotros tambi n ten amos claro que la 125 era un punto de los reclamos nuestros y la verdad es que estamos peor que el 10 de marzo porque aumentaron much simo los insumos el 20 por ciento de las retenciones todav a es cara en la ganader a no se ha resuelto nada en la lecher a tampoco y en las econom as regionales lo nico que se ha hecho son promesas
5604677 despu s del voto del congreso dijo echeverr a hoy arranca el segundo tiempo como en los partidos de f tbol vamos a hacer un poco de precalentamiento pero no tenemos tiempo porque estamos en una situaci n terminal
5604678 se endurezcan las propuestas hasta donde sea necesarios con cortes de ruta paro o lo que sea
5604679 ser a interesante una asamblea legislativa en conferencia como se hizo con botnia en donde los productores los sectores del pueblo vuelvan a expresar a viva voz sus problemas y que cada uno diga claramente lo que tiene que hacer
5604680 lo ideal dijo a este diario es que el ejecutivo estuviera ahora al lado del congreso si no se viene como con la 125 una pelea tremenda un desgaste tremendo para todos nosotros y nos costar a el doble
5604681 were paid through a major international freight forwarding and customs clearance company to employees of the nigerian customs service
5604682 in view of the groups future development the withdrawal from nigeria is in the companys best interest
5604683 admittedly foreign companies operate in an ongoing uncertain and hard to assess legal environment in nigeria this makes it difficult for panalpina to offer both a comprehensive service portfolio and at the same time meet the high ethical standards as outlined in panalpinas code of business conduct
5604684 es kommt nicht darauf an einfach nur produkte auf den markt zu bringen sondern seine zielgruppen zu verstehen und diese richtig anzusprechen
5604685 predsednik republike je formalno vezan samo na to da opravi posvet z vodji poslanskih skupin ne pa tudi na to da bi moral predlagati npr kandidata ki ga predlaga politi na stranka ki je dosegla najve je tevilo sede ev v dr avnem zboru predsednik republike v praksi upo teva razmerja v dz in politi ne procese ki se odvijajo ob oblikovanju vlade v pogojih proporcionalnega volilnega sistema se praviloma oblikuje koalicijska vlada

5604688 no decision has been made about the teams yet but we are very keen to go and be one of the clubs involved in the first afl match played over there
5604689 its a great opportunity there are growing cultural and population ties between india and australia the tigers being a revered animal in that country would be a perfect fit for the indian market
5604690 its a tremendous opportunity and would fit right in with our clubs history of developing the game with different cultures and communities we would even make a financial contribution to meet some of the costs if required
5604691 we hope to have an announcement in four to six weeks
5604692 but we are not in a position to say anything further at this stage as we are in a number of negotiations
5604693 if i somehow play well enough to win that will be huge
5604694 it is difficult to still play a lot of matches
5604695 i want to recover for the us open unfortunately i have to pull out of this tournament
5604696 ne ho altre pi hard ma quelle non le posso far vedere
5604697 we had up to six suicide bombers on foot some of the bombers were able to blow themselves up outside the base and some have been killed by our forces
5604698 the firefight is still ongoing there are no casualties on our own side
5604699 me da igual cuarto que s ptimo es medalla o no medalla
5604700 se espera que la tormenta se fortalezca durante la noche y la jornada del martes por lo que la predicci n al momento es que fay puede llegar a convertirse en hurac n vientos de m s de 119 kil metros por hora o estar muy cerca
5604701 no vi ning n tanque o personal armado abandonando la zona de conflicto
5604702 espero que el mundo haya despertado a lo que est pasando los rusos deben salir de mi pa s
5604703 no he corrido bien a pie no he tenido el d a he tenido problemas estomacales no he digerido bien el gel que tom en la bici y adem s el tend n de aquiles me ha estado dando la lata llevo dos meses que tengo molestias
5604704 espero volver a intentarlo dentro de cuatro a os me voy tranquilo porque lo he dado todo
5604705 ha habido tres que han sido m s r pidos que yo y s lo queda felicitarlos
5604706 es peor quedar el 25 que el cuarto aunque lo importante son las medallas pero el deporte es as no son matem ticas
5604707 en los juegos si en vez de estar al cien por cien est s al 97 te ganan
5604708 no llevaba nada pero lo intent porque vi que whitfield se quedaba pero al final ha vuelto a entrar en el grupo y no he podido hacer nada
5604709 lo que pasa es que el sabor que te queda de la dureza es mejor si ganas el oro
5604710 en otros sitios no tienen el nivel puntero que espa a pero tienen m s base m s medios e infraestructura
5604711 hemos tenido dos atletas en los puestos cuarto y quinto no puedo quejarme han estado en la carrera y han dado un buen espect culo
5604712 pero hac a 41 grados al sol eran las peores condiciones posibles para l aunque este a o nos hemos preparado mucho en calor
5604713 si no les deja a falta de tres kil metros no gana javi no gana al sprint
5604714 ser el triatleta del pr ximo ciclo ol mpico volver a ganar es muy seguro gana el 90 por ciento de las carreras aunque con calor algo menos
5604715 lacc l ration des r formes est la seule m thode
5604716 lacc l ration des r formes est la seule m thode qui vaille

5604927 todos los pa ses aliados en una forma u otra hemos dicho que debe haber alg n tipo de consecuencia en nuestra relaci n con rusia

5605139 you wouldnt expect ukraine to try to attach itself to the missile defense project
5605140 well see if there is a move to do it earlier
5605141 russia may have set the conditions for the missile defense program to be accelerated
5605142 i have never actually seen anyone at the house despite all the cars
5605143 its as if the people who live there are very private or always on holiday because the curtains always seem to be drawn
5605144 we drive past the house every day but i rarely saw any sign of life at all
5605145 i rarely saw the couple and much of the time the house looked deserted but there are always a lot of cars outside its a terrible shock to hear what has happened

5605149 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5605150 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man from today the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5605151 he is looking forward to coming back he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters
5605152 he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart
5605153 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5605154 we hope that tomorrows decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era
5605155 we need these monitors in there and we need them now
5605156 if we cant get those military observers in there i dont think the cease fire will hold

5605163 fishburne will play a former pathologist who is now working as an itinerant college lecturer teaching a course in criminalistics his focus is on understanding criminal behavior how and why people commit acts of violence tendencies he disturbingly sees within himself in the course of a murder investigation he comes into contact with the csi team and ultimately joins the las vegas crime lab as a level 1 csi
5605164 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5605165 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range if you distill csi down to its essence its a collaboration and we are so looking forward to collaborating with mr fishburne for all of us at csi this is truly a dream
5605166 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5605167 i look forward to a wonderful collaboration with the creative and talented team of such a successful and distinguished show
5605168 my question is whats the status on warrick gary dourdan last seasons cliffhanger did not look good for ricks future i would miss him
5605169 this imaging modality allows us to see things weve never been able to see before
5605170 we shine light on a nanotube and listen to the ultrasound waves coming out of it
5605171 this should give us early information long before the tumor shrinks or grows
5605172 i like cadwell park we went to test there a couple of months back but we had a problem with the bike so didnt really get to grips with the place it looks like its a bit safer than when i was last there four years ago and the mountain is just awesome so im looking forward to that one and just looking for that win which is just so close
5605173 this represents the first demonstration that kidney injury in membranous nephropathy can regress after selective depletion of b cells thus the present data provide a strong rationale for using rituximab to treat patients with membranous nephropathy
5605174 whether this may apply to other similar kidney conditions and may translate into long term protection from renal function loss and the potentially life threatening complications remains to be established
5605175 when used correctly backpacks are the most efficient way to carry a load and distribute the weight among some of the bodys strongest muscles
5605176 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5605177 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5605178 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5605179 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5605180 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
5605181 so we followed up on case reports and anecdotal evidence that statins being used to lower cholesterol over a six to eight week period among patients with metabolic syndrome seemed to also quickly improve erections even before cholesterol levels go down
5605182 and in an animal model we found this to be the case
5605183 statins are used by everyone under the sun and as far as i know theres been no hard evidence that it can be used to treat erectile dysfunction
5605184 on the other hand it may be that it could prevent or modify some of the other risk factors for erectile dysfunction
5605185 this is because we do know that an increase in rho kinase leads to heightened tone of the corpus smooth muscle which is one of the causes of erectile dysfunction
5605186 so while i wouldnt go too far with this and i would probably not see statins becoming a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction if these findings turn out to be true then there could perhaps be an additional good use for statins
5605187 arsenal can today confirm that togolese forward emmanuel adebayor has signed a new long term contract with the club
5605188 everyone at arsenal looks forward to emmanuels continued contribution to the club over the coming years
5605189 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5605190 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover

5605195 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5605196 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5605197 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5605198 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field

5605205 increase the number of working parents eligible for eitc benefits increase the benefits available to noncustodial parents who fulfill their child support obligations increase benefits for families with three or more children and reduce the eitc marriage penalty which hurts low income families
5605206 we are meeting the governor on monday we will request him to dismiss the government and recommend presidents rule to pave the way for fresh assembly elections
5605207 we sought an appointment with the governor on monday the bjp is ready for elections and is not interested in exploring any other possibility
5605208 as it is we working on a very tight schedule the agitation has set us back by six weeks or so even in areas not affected directly by the violence there has been hardly any work
5605209 the elections are nowhere in sight yet we decided it would be premature to hold such a meeting
5605210 the state has seen governors rule for long periods even in the past
5605211 jesuss agenda is far bigger than just one or two issues we have to care about poverty we have to care about disease we have to care about illiteracy we have to care about corruption in government sex trafficking

5605215 the encouraging thing is that in 2004 we didnt have any part in the platform discussion

5605228 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5605229 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5605230 if the recapitalization talk is realized there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 percent guaranteed

5605232 we expect airplanes to be less full and skies to be less crowded this labor day holiday

5605302 please dont focus on one particular topic this year we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies

5605304 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire

5605316 i dont care about kwame kilpatrick being the mayor of detroit
5605317 what i care about is the people of detroit making their choice as to who will be their mayor
5605318 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle

5605323 if dog breeders insist on going further down that road i can say with confidence that there is a universe of suffering waiting for many of these breeds and many if not most will not survive
5605324 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5605325 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5605326 i can only say we will not be leaving as fast as we came

5605348 we were essentially 18 days overdue and it seems like a really radical step
5605349 i really think they should have made contact with us perhaps sent a reminder notice perhaps given us a quick call
5605350 we wont be seizing any further dogs until our reminders have gone out
5605351 weve got a voice a voice that kids listen to
5605352 its so important that we get involved in this so important that we believe that things can change because no one wants to pack their children off to school and never see them again
5605353 i wasnt really thinking about my brother in the race
5605354 i kind of just hoped hed race well and hoped id race well i was just aiming for the race and whatever happened happened
5605355 i could see him coming back and i was pushing but my legs were just gone after the swim and bike i just had nothing left
5605356 i think i picked up about five or six paces in the last two laps
5605357 my legs were coming back slowly but i just pushed that last lap on the bike a bit hard for bevan
5605358 and bevan got the bronze so it was a good day
5605359 i just had to cover any major gaps with guys like spaniard javier gomez the swiss boys or anyone who was a threat i had to cover those gaps and it all came together pretty well the plan was to just hold everyone in the pack so bevan and kris could just run hard
5605360 i didnt think i was swimming that fast but obviously i was
5605361 i kind of just dived in and ended up in front and thought geez what am i doing then i thought im in the olympics i mght as well try and finish it off and try lead the whole swim
5605362 hes a class act and to win two medals at two olympics is crazy
5605363 especially in this sport its so tough anything can happen on the day hes been just so consistent
5605364 i was thinking about retirement earlier in the year but im going so well i might as well keep it going
5605365 its a good day for new zealand but its a sad day for me

5605564 my stuffs been good its where i want to be in august
5605565 i think youre seeing a much more consistent barry zito a guy we know is a good pitcher
5605566 he was great i shook him off a few times but he got a feel for it toward the end we were on the exact same page
5605567 i think theyre going to aim for the fences on this one
5605568 im a big eater he could expect a couple hundred bucks from me
5605569 i cant worry about it now i havent lost faith in them i still think they want me here thats all i have to go on when i came back everybody was happy to see me and they welcomed back with open arms
5605570 i think the business side stinks for the fans and just stinks for everybody involved
5605571 its like a tug of war and everybody is pulling in different directions but its over
5605572 we went out at 4 20 to play catch and sherrill was stiff
5605573 he couldnt get loose so i bumped everybody else up
5605574 when he makes his pitches theres not a whole lot of damage you can do
5605575 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5605576 you can walk through the streets of newark and people wouldnt know
5605577 there needs to be some serious changes made green haslost the markets confidence so if he goes i guess that isprobably a step in the right direction
5605578 the issue is that there is concern about the value of itsunderlying satellite investments the level of gearingassociated with the overall group
5605579 i think i had to do something to be fair to the team and to be fair to olson
5605580 olson needs to get some success and be put in a situation thats not as stressful and pressure packed as it would appear its been for him his last three starts
5605581 im going to keep the same approach just make quality pitches
5605582 it may be a little different coming in the middle of an inning but once youre out there and get the ball i think its the same thing
5605583 for me anytime a manager or somebody shows they have confidence in you whether you have been struggling or not that means a lot
5605584 i just know what im doing the next couple of days
5605585 i would hope so yeah you dont have to pitch to as many guys
5605586 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5605587 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over
5605588 someone told me if you come to the birds nest you will have a golden egg
5605589 i told him phelps i was going to do the 100 meter medley next year
5605590 i just put my hand over my heart and stood there leaning like i normally do
5605591 i never sing it anyway it was kind of regular for me
5605592 as bad as it sounds i think they can take whoever they want lightly and no ones going to beat them you saw them shooting half court shots before the game
5605593 theyre probably the second best team the united states has ever had third best kobe bryant isnt scoring a lot of points no one is theyre doing it together you dont know who do you stop who do you double
5605594 theyre going to win a gold medal and im happy for them everyones playing for second place
5605595 it was unbelievable in that stadium whether youre from the u s germany wherever youre from just all those people being in one place it was awesome
5605596 son mis terceros juegos y en londres vivir los cuartos
5605597 ven a aqu a disfrutar a vivir el momento a divertirme en la carrera ciclista estuve con los de alante y he disfrutado cada momento ha sido una carrera perfecta
5605598 siempre queremos medalla ganar el oro pero yo estoy contento con el resultado no estoy en mi mejor momento el resultado es bueno
5605599 lo siento no tuve otra opci n sino retirarme de la carrera
5605600 hace dos semanas corr en unos 12 9 segundos no s por qu las cosas se volvieron as quer a mantenerme pero no pude era insoportable si hubiera terminado la carrera habr a arriesgado mi tend n no podr a describir mi sentir en ese momento
5605601 no me sent a bien mientras estaba calentando justo antes de la carrera sab a que mi pie fallar a
5605602 no soy de ese tipo de personas que se retiran f cilmente y creo que volver
5605603 la final del trampol n es la competencia de mi vida
5605604 tal y como lo hab amos planeado mi entrenador jorge rueda y yo estamos muy contentos
5605605 falta una competencia creo que la m s importante de mi vida la final gracias a dios estoy all
5605606 estoy contento con el resultado ha sido una carrera muy dif cil son mis primeros juegos tengo mucho que aprender pero he luchado hasta el final
5605607 hay recib muchos golpes y me qued descolgado en un segundo grupo
5605608 pero con la bicicleta trabaj duro y volv a entrar con los mejores
5605609 no me sali bien me faltaron las fuerzas pero lo di todo
5605610 55 rivales muy bien preparados y unas condiciones muy duras
5605611 fue una carrera muy dura al nivel que se espera de unos juegos los ganadores tiene un gran m rito menos el espa ol javier g mez noya creo que todos los que ganaron estaban entre los favoritos
5605612 sobre todo mi familia la que est aqu mis pap s mis hermanas y mi novia pero tambi n a todo m xico que me ha apoyado
5605613 wenn er ber alle entscheidungserheblichen umst nde hinreichend informiert ist

5605616 we want to highlight these significant global partnerships during our milestone 30th anniversary year of the mattel childrens foundation in recognition of their expertise in helping mattel to make a direct and meaningful difference in the lives of children in need around the world
5605617 la concentraci n es fundamental la individual y la colectiva muchas veces esa es la diferencia entre conseguir un bloqueo o un remate y no hacerlo el f sico y la altura son importantes pero la cabeza lo es m s en muchas ocasiones
5605618 los juegos ol mpicos son diferentes a cualquier otra competici n por el inter s que suscita entre los aficionados de todo el mundo y eso a ade presi n a las jugadoras y hace que sea m s dif cil pensar s lo en hacer las cosas bien en el campo
5605619 la responsabilidad es grande porque todos nos dan como favoritas para la medalla de oro y nosotras no queremos decepcionar a nadie
5605620 jugar con disciplina no siempre es f cil el primer set lo ganamos f cil a jap n y eso implica que te descentres un poco en ese momento te olvidas de la disciplina de equipo y cada una intenta jugar por su cuenta con lo que el nivel del equipo baja de forma inmediata no es que nos relajemos es que no jugamos como equipo en algunos momentos
5605621 por eso las japonesas nos sorprendieron en algunos momentos porque tambi n saben jugar al voleibol y tiene dos centrales bastante grandes
5605622 en todos estoy d as de concentraci n estoy sintiendo un equipo muy unido en sinton a con esp ritu de victoria y nada de celos entre los jugadores
5605623 brasil lo hizo mal ante camer n pero argentina tampoco lo hizo bien ante holanda adem s hace tiempo que brasil no pierde con argentina algo que no es decisivo pero s indicativo
5605624 es m s un feeling que una opini n fundamentada pero creo que ganar brasil
5605625 por un lado est n los brasil argentina y por otro los que juega la canarinha contra cualquier otra selecci n del mundo son totalmente diferentes
5605626 la clave va a estar en la calidad individual en qui n est m s inspirado ronaldinho o messi
5605627 si ronaldinho tiene un buen d a es probable que gane brasil pero si lo tienen messi y riquelme
5605628 hace mucho tiempo que argentina no gana a brasil es probable que la albiceleste salga nerviosa y presionada
5605629 la defensa de argentina es mala y los nicos buenos partidos que ha hecho brasil en los ltimos a os han sido ante argentina
5605630 aquella ten a a romario y bebeto y en esta ronaldinho y alexandre pato no est n apareciendo
5605631 argentina va a ganar por dos razones por un lado tiene m s jugadores con capacidad de decidir en brasil s lo est ronaldinho el resto son proyectos de futbolistas y muy pocos formar an parte de la selecci n absoluta no como en la albiceleste por otro argentina tendr m s ganas de vencer porque ha perdido en los ltimos enfrentamientos contra brasil
5605632 argentina tomar la iniciativa y brasil de se defender y tratar de sorprender al contragolpe
5605633 si argentina juega lo que sabe especialmente messi ganar y puede incluso golear
5605634 ah puede estar la clave en parar a messi tambi n a riquelme creo que dunga colocar a hernanes y lucas sobre ellos
5605635 a dunga s lo le gusta defender hasta ahora lo est n haciendo bien pero contra qui n han jugado
5605636 hace menos de un a o estaba haciendo la pretemporada con argentinos juniors luego me fui a italia y ahora estoy en unos juegos ol mpicos es incre ble todo ha ido muy r pido pero los momentos hay que aprovecharlos
5605637 brasil es mucho brasil pero nosotros estamos listos yo tambi n
5605638 habl con l est an micamente bien le dije que est tranquilo y que ahora tiene que pensar en s mismo que la recuperaci n va a ser muy larga
5605639 jap n tiene algunas jugadoras altas y hacen un buen bloqueo no fue f cil pasarlo nos complicaron un poco las cosas sobre todo en el segundo set y al principio del tercero pero supimos seguir jugando y ganar el pase a las semifinales
5605640 los partidos de cuartos son dif ciles de jugar siempre tienen mucha presi n se prepara a conciencia y las jugadoras estamos en tensi n porque sabemos que no hay posibilidad de fallo todo esto hace que sea dif cil concentrarse y jugar bien pero afortunadamente todo sali perfecto y ganamos
5605641 todo el mundo nos da como favoritas para ganar el oro y eso nos a ade mucha presi n al equipo nosotras tambi n queremos ganar es nuestro sue o pero todav a no sabemos si lo lograremos de momento estamos jugando bien y obteniendo buenos resultados pero tenemos que seguir trabajando igual para ver si podemos conseguir ese sue o
5605642 la gente quiere que adem s de ganar juguemos siempre bien y eso no siempre es posible los rivales tambi n juegan y tienen gente de calidad
5605643 sab a que pod a lograrlo logr este objetivo que era una meta muy grande
5605644 deportistas de mucho potencial y que es muy importante mejorar el apoyo cada vez m s para que colombia siga saliendo adelante
5605645 llueve mucho y eso ser a muy importante para poder tener un poco m s de concentraci n y no perder tanto tiempo por la lluvia
5605646 lo segundo ser a seguir con el apoyo mejor ndolo m s y lo tercero ser a hacer escuelas de clavados que los ni os entren si les gusta
5605647 muchas cosas que por ahora va mejorando cada vez m s y estamos demostrando m s al mundo que nosotros tambi n podemos

5605653 i have not blogged for a while now it feels like forever mainly because i have succumbed to the rule of bloggers block
5605654 we have seen a trend in several of our top hotel markets of more guests at hotels being locals or from nearby areas
5605655 houston for example has seen some of the most significant increases in this category
5605656 we do know the word on the street is that its happening
5605657 people join for getting towed but stay for the extra benefits
5605658 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
5605659 at that time a lot of people may have decided to stay in the area because of fuel prices
5605660 the no 1 reason people visit the houston area is to see friends and family
5605661 weve seen an increase this summer in just our regional destination draw
5605662 but we figured we werent not going to go on vacation so we went to the woodlands
5605663 we went to florida only because we had a 60 resort stay for the week
5605664 there was a lot of pre shopping rental cars hotels where to eat
5605665 i do what i want i strive hard for things that i need to accomplish in my life i stick to my own principles i do not trust easily i often doubt but i confirm i made a lot of mistakes in my life been through rough times but thats how it goes
5605666 the badge of chairman mao zedong was crucial to my success
5605667 unfortunately i was eliminated in the first round in athens which was an unbelievable loss for me
5605668 i won the gold and my wish is fulfilled i will go to the place shaoshan again
5605669 ambuja cements has been in a persistent downtrend so i think one has to look at potential declines from here and for that reason rs 77 should be a stoploss because below that it is going to be at 2 3 months low and with considerable downside risk so perhaps it is better to switch out of this stock if it goes below rs 77 or even switch out now because it is not really doing very well in the market
5605670 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5605671 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5605672 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5605673 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5605674 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5605675 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5605676 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5605677 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5605678 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5605679 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5605680 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5605681 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5605682 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5605683 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5605684 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5605685 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area
5605686 when folks have a chance to move on they move on
5605687 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
5605688 the only way to make money is selling dope on the corner
5605689 it gives a really powerful message that if youre not in school were going to your home
5605690 most of the time we find dropouts not working and not happy with life
5605691 hindalco is just rs 3 away i e rs 124 from making a two year low i think it is not a good idea to be holding on stocks which are at two year low so i would switch out of it right away to something more defensive technology and pharma are again attracting some buying so those would be good options but if one wants to give it a last chance for the stock to bounce back then rs 124 could be the final stoploss

5605720 so you think doug her fiance is a cardboard cut out
5605721 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5605722 what is heartening on that question is that both candidates have indicated that they will be moving on this and with an ambitious set of targets
5605723 there is no way the first world can solve this problem alone even if the united states comes in
5605724 that is why australia coming in to the kyoto protocol is critical
5605725 the new tri site platform has given us an enhanced level of functionality that a standalone paper would not be able to achieve
5605726 this huge resource greatly expands what we have to offer and means we can do more than just shunt newspaper copy online
5605727 we are thrilled with the huge increase in audience the website has seen so soon after launch
5605728 if this trend continues we would be tracking 4m page impressions per month which we would be delighted with but our ambition is to be bigger
5605729 it was frightening when our readers started to interact with us
5605730 within ten minutes of us switching on the new website we had our first comment it was amazing
5605731 he was a newspaper man through and through even on the day he died he got a story about speedway with his byline in the eastbourne herald
5605732 im really pleased to join the nctj board in this age of the convergent newsroom when demands on journalists have never been greater
5605733 the nctj is raising standards of training across the uk and that can only add to the quality of the publications we produce and benefit the people who read them
5605734 the life of the journalist has rarely faced a more radical change in the past 100 years than it does now the fundamental role of the journalist to tell people things they otherwise would not know has not
5605735 the nctj is vitally important in preparing the next generation of journalists for the changes that are happening and are to come while ensuring they still know how to ask the questions and communicate the answers in any medium
5605736 we are delighted to have ed curran and chris elliott on board
5605737 ed will be a huge asset to the board of the nctj he is a great enthusiast and his appointment reflects our plans as a result of demand from employers and students to expand our accredited training and gold standard qualifications for journalists in northern ireland

5605742 i was hoping not to need two throws because there were so many people in the pool sayers said
5605743 but i had a bit of food poisoning last week at our training camp in macau and nerves mixed with food poisoning in an olympic qualifying round doesnt make for very good stomach cramps suffolk homes
5605744 this is the last sighting we currently have of the victim prior to the incident
5605745 the footage shows the victim is wearing a light coloured sleeveless jacket were you driving or walking along west end road at this time
5605746 any piece of information however small and unrelated it may seem could assist the investigation
5605747 the first thing that he will do when he returns home is to focus on his health since he is fairly old
5605748 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia

5605752 some of my plans and schemes have had to be put on hold because there is not much i can do if i cant walk properly
5605753 thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoelaces and bad handwriting
5605754 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being awful at everything with no discernible talent
5605755 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5605756 we hebben veel succes gehad niet alleen in europa maar dit toernooi waren we aan slag niet goed genoeg normaal gesproken scoren we wel

5605758 do we really need to see women playing volleyball in bikinis
5605759 would shorts and a t shirt really hinder their performance im convinced the real reason that womens olympic softball is going the way of the cassette player is because the players compete fully clothed and who picked the fabric for the u s womens gymnasts outfits yikes
5605760 i havent seen so much shiny spandex since a jazzercise class in 1989 just google shiny spandex and see what you get not olympic athletes
5605761 were all backslapping each other this has been months in the making
5605762 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
5605763 and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5605764 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such a biological profile if such a biological profile did exist
5605765 its nothing as simple as he has the genes of a serial killer because theres no such thing
5605766 its a fascinating and incredibly intense process and i think laurence is going to get a lot out of it

5605771 friends first reaction was usually a mixture of shock and what a great thing you are doing how brave you are and how extraordinary that you are a match
5605772 for me it felt like none of those things i dont remember the conversation or even thought processes about how we decided i should put myself forward for donation it was automatic
5605773 our interview felt a bit like applying for a green card except it was held in the foetal ward at another hospital i had to take evidence of our relationship including photos of ourselves together
5605774 before i had the op i had a creatinin level the level of toxins in my blood of 400 now it is just 105 five above what the doctors want
5605775 people said i looked a much healthier colour immediately and now my energy levels are much improved one of the nicest things is i can enjoy food now when before it just tasted of chemicals
5605776 going into hospital made me realise just what a gift it was other people were so poorly with complications or rejections
5605777 fingers crossed i will not suffer a rejection episode two months ago i was facing dialysis and a grim future now im hoping this kidney will see me out
5605778 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5605779 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units

5605789 i can count on one hand the number of people here with any kind of crop this year
5605790 but growers are the ultimate optimists hopefully well have a good crop next year

5605829 as a game ten years in the making one that was originally conceived as a playstation title when sonys inaugural gray box was only just beginning to hit its stride too human has the misfortune of being a long awaited title from a studio that doesnt make many games i say misfortune because hype and expectation will be the only things that hurt the otherwise enjoyable experience that the game offers so much is expected of this title one of the first big guns in microsofts holiday line up that its almost impossible for the modest game to live up to everything some gamers will want from it

5605842 there are no clear villains government is looking to give taxpayers free access to the research that they fund and publishers are trying to protect their business and the integrity of the research they publish
5605843 publishers invest considerable resources through the peer review process to ensure that only the best articles are published in their journals
5605844 it says a lot about our team and how motivated we are to win
5605845 were just disrupting everything theyre trying to do not letting them relax on offense or defense
5605846 we could have easily come in and had one of those games where we were making excuses
5605847 but we didnt take a step backward and that was good
5605848 with one or two more years under my belt i can really make a difference in games like this

5605859 but this isnt the kinda job you should be in with that attitude
5605860 boy youre gonna be in so much shit if you dont figure out where to draw the line
5605861 by a slight slight edge as of today gaskins is the no 2 quarterback
5605862 it was very close but thats what our staff has decided
5605863 daniel sorensen was one of the highlights of the scrimmage on saturday not only in special teams but the way he is playing defense
5605864 sean has done the best job of running our entire offense and doing everything that we need to do with our offense
5605865 he has a little more huddle command right now and thats simply because hes older and has more experience diondre is making great strides and sean knows that diondre is a person we trust to put into the ball game you have to start somewhere and you have to start someone for that first series we feel we have two guys we can use
5605866 sean setzer will be our quarterback for the unlv game but we anticipate diondre will be in the game for a significant amount of time because of his running ability
5605867 so if he sees something he can change up the call
5605868 we are 12 days out now and its time to start getting a little more serious about things and start honing in
5605869 we all know the opportunity we have and we definitely have to get it done so whatever we need to do we need to do time is running out
5605870 were not where we need to be 12 days out we certainly have to make a lot of progress in 12 days
5605871 we have to go out and execute our offense that is the bottom line
5605872 a lot of times the o line gets most of it but a lot of time its the quarterback not getting the ball out of his hands in time or the receivers not running the right depth its attention to detail once again
5605873 they played really really good volleyball so you have to hand it to them
5605874 i felt like we were strong and we were right there i felt like we were going to take over the lead at any time and get going but they stayed strong as well
5605875 its tough right now its tough to swallow but were going to take great things away from this

5605905 well do our best to bring back bengal into the elite division initially after taking over we faced a problem in which most of the seniors wanted to leave the state they felt that by representing bengal in plate division chances to make the national or india a side will be less which is a genuine reason

5605916 reliance reflects the index because of its high weightage in the index and it is essentially going to be a case of whether the market bottoms out anytime soon or not if it were to bottom out then reliance should be alright but overall it is not an unsafe stock it is not too volatile on the downside so the investors could hold on to it but one could expect perhaps a decline of 10 15

5606235 there was a level of comfort that id never experienced before from a mattress or a pillow
5606236 athletes sweat a lot in their sleep and the natural memory foam helps control my body temperature rather than elevate it by creating a humid and sticky environment when i move at night my wife doesnt feel it so it doesnt wake her up and whats most important to both of us is that were breathing in fresh air rather than toxic chemicals while we sleep

5606246 hockey games havent started with a bully off for years we now start with a push back
5606247 how many more gold medals can we realistically expect to win in these games and what is the main reason for such a haul spinach
5606248 re 0802 i think youll find that hockey games bully off rather than kick off brace yourself for a torrent of abuse from the sticks and shinpads brigade
5606249 an athletic contest in which participants go queer in their heads and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them is not sport it is brutality
5606250 the tactics that goodison employed are perfectly legitimate its the perogative of someone getting himself a lead in the early races the swede knew what goodison would try and do it was up to him to prevent it
5606251 whod have thought reading live text about a sailing boat race would be exciting stuff i need to get out more still its another brit gold yay nice one well done that lad
5606252 with conditions so tricky there was only one way to ensure i got gold and thats what i did race tactics you come to every olympics to do your best and im on top of the table i cant wait to give my mum a big hug it just feels unbelievable its going to take a while to sink in but wow with london just around the corner its hard to think its all over its a massive opportunity to represent britain at home
5606253 i got to 7km on the run and there was nothing left ive got to find a way of getting 12 places better in time for london
5606254 i wasnt fast enough so i had to do too much on the bike and that meant i came to the run tired i have to go back and do lots of work on my swimming
5606255 wow what a finish without a doubt the best mens triathlon ive watched at almost five in the morning
5606256 those tri athletes make me cry every time amazing effort great result for gb too if only there was a team medal
5606257 their gbs new found cockiness has got some substance to it they may well beat us this time but lets use that as the incentive to get the planning right for our high performance and our attack on london 2012
5606258 ive just spoken to a boa press officer who says tim don was vomiting all day and night on thursday and friday he couldnt even hold liquid down but he wanted to race anyway organisers have tried to pull him out as he is so far back but hes determined to carry on hollie avil who pulled out during the bike stage of the womens event also had a stomach bug so maybe it is connected apparently all the athletes have eaten the same thing meanwhile brownlee is in bronze position and looking extremely good in his favourite part of the event
5606259 i like to leave things to the last minute i dont know what my problem is im mad it took me three rounds
5606260 job done im pleased ive got the feel for the track and im looking forward to the final
5606261 alistair brownlee runs like eric liddell from chariots of fire go boy looks damn good if you ask me
5606262 jamaica famously took gold silver and bronze in the womens 100m why are they showing as having no bronze medals in the column in your full medal table
5606263 brownlee and clarke flew by me as they start their final lap on the bike both are looking comfortable in the middle of the main pack nobody seems concerned about the three man breakaway their lead was about 30 seconds but none of the big boys are involved so it looks like it will come down to a shoot out on the run tim don has just gone past me and he is labouring about four and a half minutes down and on his own he has a long and lonely ride ahead of him
5606264 a nightmare for tim don he is not in the leading group of 40 and he has dropped off the chasing pack and is almost two minutes behind he is now riding on his own and his olympic dream seems over the 20 year old alistair brownlee is looking good and is right at the front after a fantastic swim while will clarke is in the second group about a minute back
5606265 we want to get out there and kick butt against the chinese on their home soil
5606266 it is so difficult to win against them like this
5606267 there were no worries for the three brits on the swim leg as they reach the pontoon they are looking well placed it is blazing hot still and the bike leg with that brutal hill will be particularly punishing
5606268 look out for alistair brownlee in the tri last time i saw him he was kicking my a se at the ilkley triathlon considering he was still wearing armbands and stabilisers it was a fearsome performance future champ
5606269 an open question for everyone even you pranav do you think that due to the success weve had with the bikes and in water sports that more money from the lottery fund should go towards these sports as we are more likely to pick up medals in them than track and field
5606270 lets hope we have a tremendous tuesday and make it our best medal haul ever all of team gb should be proud of what weve achieved at these games so far
5606271 there is still an hour to go before the start of the triathlon which is being held at a fantastic location team gb has three competitors and a decent shout at a medal but the heat is already a problem i just spotted gb hope will clarke checking the pressure on his bike tyres his family are all over here to support him and gave out a big cheer as he pedalled slowly past

5606273 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5606274 our commando units were deployed into the area and engaged the attackers and pushed them back
5606275 so far 13 attackers have been killed six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5606276 thirteen suicide bombers were killed in kijran area of ali sher district
5606277 they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5606278 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5606279 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5606280 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5606281 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5606282 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5606283 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5606284 the fundamental question i have for is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5606285 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5606286 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5606287 the sitting swing finding the wisdom to know the difference
5606288 in the promotional products industry we have a common saying that every promotional pen has an average of six users in its lifetime we had the idea to demonstrate the progression of passing a pen along from one person to the next much like the pop culture game six degrees of kevin bacon this is a highly effective way to show just how many impressions one promotional pen will have
5606289 if a client has 5 000 to spend on advertising they can either buy one page advertisement in the local paper or they can buy 5 000 writing instruments unlike the newspaper ad which will only appear in one edition the pens will be passed from user to user allowing the decorated message to live on for years to come to think of the number of people who see or use just one of those pens is staggering if as consumers we look in our desks in our purses or next to our home telephones well find a pen with someone elses name on it theres no reason it cant be your name on that pen

5606300 voor mij was het ongelofelijk dat hij er was als iemand als maradona je komt bekijken dan is dat een enorme motivatie om boven jezelf uit te stijgen
5606301 we use the word bias in certain areas of our study but we also talk about blind spots
5606302 people are operating on assumptions of what old is and what elderly patients need
5606303 we were surprised that this was a recurrence of something we saw in the late 1990s this is something we have to revisit periodically
5606304 and we want to share it with other states and ems systems because if its happening in maryland its likely happening everywhere
5606305 trauma is often seen as a disease of the young
5606306 but thats changing you have a fairly active aging population that is playing sports being active and getting injured
5606307 no one ever admits they have a bias they say they know someone who does something biased
5606308 basically its difficult to get a handle on what bias is so instead of defining bias we wanted to show that people behaved differently and find a way to fix the problem
5606309 sometimes the younger doctors see a person being evaluated and it turns out to be negative and the patient is sent home
5606310 part of the problem is everybodys got aches and pains its hard to tell is that a broken hip or something else
5606311 this is much more complicated in older people there are many issues that make injury in the elderly much more difficult to get your arms around
5606312 zimbabwes annual rate of inflation surged in june to 11 2 million percent
5606313 it gained 9 035 045 5 percentage points from the may rate of 2 233 713 4 percent
5606314 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
5606315 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months

5606317 i can count on one hand the number of people here with any kind of crop this year
5606318 but growers are the ultimate optimists hopefully well have a good crop next year
5606319 i dont care if youre making spark plugs or olives you need a constant flow into the market
5606320 we cant build a market and then say we dont have any olives this year
5606321 compared to the last two years this is a pleasant change of pace
5606322 this would be considered an average to slightly above average crop and a night and day difference from the last two years

5606469 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5606470 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5606471 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5606493 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5606494 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5606495 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5606496 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5606497 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5606498 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5606499 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5606500 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5606501 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5606502 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5606503 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5606504 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5606505 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5606506 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5606507 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5606508 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5606509 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5606520 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5606521 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5606522 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5606523 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5606542 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5606543 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5606544 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5606548 looking at ourselves in the mirror teachers as reflective practitioners
5606549 we have already referred to the tendency in higher education for knowledge to be treated as static disembodied as a product rather than a process where students may be detached from the knowledge being imparted
5606550 in recognizing the interaction for dialogue as constituting a relationship between teacher and learner and between learners we are saying that is knowledge that is the material of the interaction comes through communication
5606551 for us dialogue that is reflective and enables critically reflective learning engages the person at the edge of their knowledge their sense of self and the world as experienced by them thus their assumptions about knowledge themselves and their world is challenged by this we mean that the individual is at the edge of their current understanding and the sense of meaning they give to and with the world existing assumptions about understanding self and the world are challenged that learning becomes reflectively critical when the emergent ideas are related to existing sense of knowledge self and the world and a new understanding emerges

5606560 i believed that i was under arrest and that if i did not comply with whatever they asked me that they will either use physical violence or take me to a more sinister place to interrogate me or you know do something to my family or deport me

5606563 despite the few numbers of soldiers that this country has in the christian alliance its withdrawal will be considered an achievement and victory to be added to the numerous victories of the moslem fighters praise god
5606564 it can also be major groups trying to complicate the counter terrorism effort
5606565 it can be defeat for the coalition without being a victory for anyone its inevitable that someone will see victory in withdrawal
5606566 on this occasion we call on all moslem fighters from all factions working on the land in beloved iraq to always in keeping with their undertaking to moslem kin to be as one
5606567 i think there is a lot of ignorance because many people think that islamic schools will be teaching violence and hate

5606571 many people think if muslims move into the community that means that locals wont be able to have bacon on their burgers thats the sort of psychology we are dealing with
5606572 they need to move out of the areas that are wholly muslim because they dont get the aussie values as well as they would get them here

5606575 the crime of false imprisonment and kidnap at common law
5606576 clearly asio has to be given the power to conduct inquiries into terrorism activity particularly within australia but it should do so within the law
5606577 the fact that this criticism has been made is a worry
5606578 the problem with asio powers particularly with the huge number of increased terrorism laws that
5606579 and with unaccountability comes the sort of behaviour that this particular supreme court judge has complained of
5606580 terrorism laws are draconian if judges are finding that asio operatives are breaking even these draconian laws which favour asio against the individual then something serious needs to be done about it
5606581 despite asios attempts to bury its actions under the mantra of state secrets
5606582 over the next several months i would also be encouraging other friends and partners and allies in nato to continue their commitments and where possible extend them
5606583 here there is a war against terrorism against fanaticism that we cannot and must not lose
5606584 that is why it is important that we help with the emergence of an afghan state that is legitimate democratic and modern
5606585 we think this is an important campaign and we will of course stay the course
5606586 i am concerned that a number of nato countries are not taking up their share of the burden and on that basis we would have no intention of increasing our contribution
5606587 so no one should get the impression that because we have the actual capacity of the overwatch battle group in iraq that we suddenly have all this additional capacity to deal with additional contingencies in afghanistan
5606588 i had hoped to be able to speak to the media but i am just not strong enough at the moment its as simple as that
5606589 as part of my conditions of release from guantanamo bay i agreed not to speak to the media on a range of issues before march 30 2008
5606590 its my intention to honour this agreement as i dont want to do anything that might result in my return there
5606591 so for now i will limit what i have to say i will say more at a later time
5606592 the huge debt of gratitude that i owe the australian public for getting me home
5606593 right now i am looking forward to some quiet time with my wonderful dad my family and friends
5606594 i ask that you will respect my privacy as i will need time to readjust to society and obtain medical care for the consequences of five and a half years at guantanamo bay
5606595 i have been told that my readjustment will be a slow process and should involve a gentle transition away from the media spotlight
5606596 he now has got to get on with his life
5606597 hes on a high he seems alright but i suppose in the quiet times everything will come back
5606598 but our advice and our conviction is that this is a job worth doing
5606599 there are important meetings coming up over the next several months
5606600 i would also be encouraging other friends and partners and allies in nato to continue their commitment to this country and where possible to expand that commitment
5606601 our biggest security problem is that the international community has not been concerned enough about the rear bases of the taliban and terrorists outside afghanistan
5606602 we dont have strong teams and the other schools make fun of us
5606603 we want to get a physical education teacher so we can enter inter school competitions
5606604 there was a vote of no confidence and mustafa was elected by his party because he won his seat
5606605 he appointed a cabinet and a governor general the school staff are referred to as the senate
5606606 the students see it as a real parliament because they are contributing to the running of the school it is teaching them about leadership and taking responsibility for decisions
5606607 we decided to recreate the political system in schools to revolutionise civics education
5606608 we piloted it in our school and within 12 months we had a parliamentary club with a membership of 80 students
5606609 we are seeking state government funding to assist us in setting up the program in more schools
5606610 in 15 years time afghanistan is likely to be divided geographically
5606611 an optimistic vision sees the government in kabul with a tangible writ across the north and west
5606612 provincial leaders will respond to central directives because kabul is delivering the benefits of international assistance
5606613 in the south and east pashtun provincial leaders will take part in national governance and several provinces will be passive however areas of kandahar helmand and the eastern provinces that border pakistan will suffer from insurgency
5606614 there may be scope for a bigger australia federal police presence in areas where the insurgency is absent but law and order is weak
5606615 some nato militaries are currently conducting police training this is potentially counter productive just as police would not be used to train infantry soldiers are not suited to preparing a police force
5606616 only coordinated donor funds and the right personnel will improve the situation
5606617 he underscored that unless canada was able to meet the conditions specified by the panel of additional combat troops and equipment from nato allies canadas mission in afghanistan will not be extended
5606618 halftime at the bright house the knights would make a comeback the name goes up

5606636 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s but it would be damaging and dangerous to the economy
5606637 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two per cent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5606638 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs
5606639 then well all be back to square one but with inflation still high
5606640 throughout the launch of windows server 2008 we said we would be keeping with a 2 4 year major minor release cadence with the next version of windows server so it is appropriate that the name of the next version reflect that windows server 2008 r2
5606641 that release cadence is indeed still the plan for the server team
5606642 it is important to note that windows vista shipped a year earlier than windows server 2008 so the client version of windows 7 will have an extra year of development the client in fact will be a major release but as weve said before compatibility with previous versions of windows vista and windows server 2008 is a design goal
5606643 im proposing that the price of petrol be cut by at least five cents a litre at the bowser that is deflationary
5606644 i am also opposed to the increase in tax on alcopops the tax is inflationary
5606645 were also opposed to the medicare surcharge proposals which will have an inflationary impact on private health insurance premiums
5606646 mr rudd can reorder his priorities if he wants to keep the bottom line the same
5606647 if the government was fair dinkum about fighting inflation it wouldnt be increasing taxes on cars computers software alcohol and a whole variety of other things that australians consume
5606648 i think the liberal party has simply lost the plot they are so riven by internal divisions they are incapable by behaving in a responsible way
5606649 everything from our culture itself to education prevention to pricing advertising labelling the enforcement of existing laws and also i think the way in which we approach the issue of parenting
5606650 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5606651 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5606652 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5606653 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5606654 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5606655 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5606656 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5606657 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5606658 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5606659 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5606660 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5606661 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5606662 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5606663 happiness factory musicians and designers working together what a great idea
5606664 topps rightly prizes its reputation for accuracy and the matter is under investigation
5606665 the reality is that the broderick family has been visiting kilcar for nearly 30 years you could say they are adopted citizens at this stage they have integrated fully into the area and we are proud of that
5606666 they come here for peace and tranquillity and relaxation and we the local community are extremely anxious that their privacy is respected
5606667 we see them more as one of our own at this stage they may be glamorous celebrities but when they come here they are treated as ordinary people and allowed to go about their business without interference
5606668 when you go into a pub there its like you are going into somebodys home in a way very friendly
5606669 i think that is what they have liked so much about coming here the fact that they could be out and about and nobody would take a blind bit of notice of them but that is starting to change now and its too bad
5606670 and if that requires segregation well then we have got to segregate the child in the best interests of that child
5606671 they need proper english language training but my view is at the moment thats not happening i know my views are controversial but the bottom line is that i have only the interest of the new irish at heart

5606673 the desired financial return of any developer to be a valid planning consideration
5606674 a building of this kind if permitted would explode all the good planning principles in the area
5606675 to permit this development in the absence of such a study would be to engage in an ad hoc approach to tall buildings and of course would undermine the planned approach to tall buildings and the identification of appropriate sites for their selection
5606676 the government told eskom to build in 2004 but it didnt accompany that with the changes to policy regulatory or governance frameworks to support that decision and ensure the system could be managed through some tough years
5606677 the forecasts said tough years would come yet there was no sense of crisis nor the capacity and leadership within the government thabo mbeki and his ministers to respond as the risks mounted it took a crisis to provide the catalyst for action to start breaking some of the policy deadlocks
5606678 the danger is that sa could overinvest in power again and commit in long term investments it may not be able to afford and may not ultimately need the potential for high level corruption when contracts are being signed at this level is enormous the danger is that the nuclear programme could become sas next arms deal

5606702 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5606703 ich hatte das gl ck gleich mehrere gro e jahre zu haben ich kann mich nicht beklagen und ich danke gott daf r
5606704 ich habe sechzehn jahre auf hohem niveau gespielt und nur drei waren nicht so berauschend
5606705 das waren nicht immer nur rosige zeiten aber ich habe tagt glich mit grandiosen spielern zusammengespielt zu meiner zeit war ja noch zidane bei turin daher war das eine gro artige sache damals
5606706 das ist meine sch nste erinnerung an einen mannschaftserfolg schlie lich handelte es sich um einen weltweit anerkannten titel und den ersten sieg einer afrikanischen mannschaft in diesem wettbewerb
5606707 mein tor gegen spanien 1998 um so mehr als es das siegtor war daran erinnern sich noch heute alle
5606708 beim afrikanischen nationen pokal 1994 war ich einer der besten spieler des turniers danach bin ich nach italien gegangen um anschlie end die beste saison meiner karriere in k ln zu spielen wo ich zum besten defensiven mittelfeldspieler deutschlands gew hlt wurde
5606709 da ging es f r mich erst richtig los wir haben 1998 das double geholt und in der darauffolgenden saison unseren titel im pokal verteidigt und wir haben klasse fussball gespielt das war das wichtigste
5606710 ich lasse es langsam angehen aber das ist auch gut so ich hatte nie das bed rfnis gleich in der ersten liga anfangen zu m ssen ich habe als aktiver auf ganz hohem niveau gespielt als trainer reicht es mir im zweifelsfalle nur meinen sohn zu trainieren

5606727 na het aftreden van de pakistaanse president pervez musharraf zal de radicaalislamitische taliban niet floreren de extremisten zullen ook na het tijdperk musharraf even hard worden aangepakt daarbij zal het pakistaanse antiterreurbeleid minder dubbelzinnig zijn
5606728 de grootste zorg van de amerikanen is de politieke instabiliteit in pakistan de moord op ex premier benazir bhutto eind vorig jaar gaf die stabiliteit een flinke dreun maar volgens de vs was ook musharraf een deel van het probleem omdat hij niet democratisch regeerde
5606729 zeker in zijn laatste maanden was musharraf aan het koorddansen
5606730 toen zijn populariteit kelderde probeerde hij vriend en vijand aan zijn kant te scharen en was hij daardoor controversieel in zijn aanpak aan de ene kant poogde hij de taliban de kop in te drukken maar aan de andere kant ging hij ook met de rebellenleiders om de tafel zitten hij werd niet alleen door zijn eigen volk maar ook internationaal met een scheve blik aangekeken

5606753 das innenministerium muss die planstellen der verkehrspolizei deutlich erh hen um weiterhin die sicherheit im stra enverkehr zu gew hrleisten
5606754 und zwar dort wo es um sicherheit geht nicht um geld f r den stra enerhalter zu beschaffen
5606755 es ist f r mich nachvollziehbar dass einige gemeinden diese zweitbeste l sung gew hlt haben
5606756 aber da die verkehrspolizei personell nicht mehr in der lage ist das tempo auf gef hrlichen stra enabschnitten zu berwachen bleibt mir keine andere m glichkeit als das innenministerium aufzufordern die dienstposten bei der verkehrspolizei wieder deutlich aufzustocken denn wenn man nicht rasch auf die entscheidung der datenschutzkommission reagiere hie e das sich mitschuldig zu machen an mehr verletzten und toten auf sterreichs stra en

5606760 theres nothing more powerful than the experience of knowing you have touched anothers life in a transformative way we need a way of communicating this to young people and supporting their education to enter the field
5606761 child welfare research is increasingly identifying the importance of a professionally trained and supervised work force to good outcomes for our most vulnerable families and children not surprisingly social work education and training are found to be the best preparation for the work
5606762 as our population ages the needs of older adults and those caring for them will increase
5606763 its critical that we invest in expanding gerontological social work education training and research
5606764 will help to design and implement more effective programs targeting the unmet needs of different populations for example resources and programs that enable older adults to remain in a supportive housing environment the legislations goal of expanding gerontological social work training and research which target community based programs and legislative solutions would be one way to address this need
5606765 jump in there and git er done go to gal
5606766 we were kind of going back and forth i was kind of listening to everybody i gave all the coaches even the defensive coaches a chance to voice their opinions i just kind of listened and then didnt sleep much tossing it over in my mind but when i came in this morning i was pretty solid with what i wanted to do
5606767 the biggest thing to me is how well jordan has played
5606768 i think its important that i evaluate what i see i have credibility and i have to have some credibility with my players too because they see it also if you dont reward people who practice well i think youre in danger of losing the whole team im not going to do that
5606769 but i think well play portis i think hell have a role maybe as a tempo changer and well kind of see where that goes and how well he does
5606770 very clear to me that it was an open competition
5606771 i went through it with both of them before i told them the decision
5606772 thats his m o but we didnt win every game he played in we need consistency based on not only fall practice but i even went back to spring practices and steffy was by far and away ahead in all the statistics
5606773 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5606774 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5606775 i wanted to hang on but i couldnt it was unbearable if i had finished the race i would have risked my tendon i could not describe my feeling at that moment

5606785 with time batsmen will get used to playing him even murali some seven eight years back was really difficult
5606786 everybody was talking about him with time i think it will get a bit easier mendis is a bit more unusual than murali i have not seen any bowler like this
5606787 mendis is difficult to pick because he is a very different bowler
5606788 but if you see the way he has played the two games against us even in the asia cup he gave away just ten runs in six or eight overs you need to take a few from him and a few from murali and look to attack the others youve got to have something on the board
5606789 we were off to a good start in the asia cup but then we lost quick wickets
5606790 after that when you are playing mendis its difficult it gets a bit tough when you have to rotate the strike and also save the wicket if the bowler is as unusual as mendis
5606791 it sounds like you are more interested in the applied engineering aspects of agile than the tools and practices

5606803 my dad shouted so much that we thought there were lions in the house
5606804 there were flames everywhere you looked we had to watch as the whole place burnt down

5606808 so many traumatic things have happened to our family this year nine family members have died and my husband and daughter were both in hospital twice a friend of mine died due to an aneurysm and a month ago my car was hijacked
5606809 we were at kwa maritane because my husband pan had a stroke six weeks ago when people started beating on the door and yelled we should come out i got a huge fright and immediately thought of the hijacking the fire has just been too much for me
5606810 i woke up from noises that sounded like the wind at first i thought it was at the pool where they are building but then i heard things falling down when i looked out of the window i only saw flames
5606811 we have only a cellphone and car keys i dont even have a dry nappy for gabriel
5606812 one of the problems we face in maintaining the church environment is that we tend to overlook defects after about four weeks once you become familiar with a building you stop noticing whats wrong with it the defects and disorder dont bother you as much as they did when you first noticed them you become oblivious to the faded paint the frayed carpet the chipped pulpit the outdated tract rack in the vestibule the old bulletins left inside hymnals the stack of stuff on the piano and the burned out light bulbs overhead
5606813 unfortunately these things stand out immediately to visitors they notice details

5606828 he comes in not immediately as the boss but he has an interesting genetic profile that in certain sort of medical contexts theyve noticed that many times serial killers have that same genetic profile
5606829 and this gentleman knows this about himself and is sort of in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5606830 let me just say that i have no knowledge of such biological profile nor would i be at liberty to speak about such a biological profile if such a biological profile did exist

5606850 its a one way ticket to an ofarrell victory at the 2011 election
5606851 the only winner from alp unrest is mr ofarrell and his team
5606852 this is all about morris iemma trying to preserve his leadership using an appalling poll result to shore up his hapless premiership instead of getting the real message that exists in this poll

5606854 i think we are playing good technically physically and mentally
5606855 we fought we gave it our best but we also made some stupid mistakes
5606856 certainly our team has to play better the next two games to win

5606874 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5606875 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5606876 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5606879 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5606880 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5606881 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5606882 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5606883 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5606884 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5606885 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5606886 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5606887 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5606888 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5606889 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5606907 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5606908 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5606909 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5606910 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5606911 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5606912 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5606913 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5606914 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5606915 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5606916 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5606917 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5606918 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5606919 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5606920 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5606921 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5606922 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5606923 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5606924 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5606925 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5606926 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5606927 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5606928 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5606929 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5606930 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5606931 i think whats exciting about being a woman and being 40 is that very often you have a kind of confidence that took all those years to get
5606932 but youre still young enough to be excited and to be vital about the future without having to worry about your identity am i a mother
5606933 if you go to iraq enough times youre going to get hurt or die
5606934 its not a matter of if its a matter of when
5606935 i can take it ive been through a lot worse in iraq
5606936 but i dont feel its fair my family has to suffer for something i didnt do and theres not even proof of me doing
5606937 arising out of or in connection with actions of a police officer
5606938 i believe in my heart that had kathleen savios case been properly handled my sister would most likely be alive today
5606939 i cannot help thinking about that on a regular basis and believe that no family member should suffer the emotional roller coaster that i have been on the last 10 months
5606940 i cant get away with telling my citizens we have a great system it failed
5606941 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5606942 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship his childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5606943 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5606944 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5606945 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5606946 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5606948 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5606949 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5606950 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5606951 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5606952 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5606953 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5606954 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5606955 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5606956 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5606957 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5606958 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5606959 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5606960 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5606961 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5606962 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5606963 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5606964 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5606965 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5606966 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5606967 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5606968 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5606969 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5606970 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5606973 i am not too concerned about soft ground she won the computaform sprint and man owar stakes in those conditions
5606974 obviously she is a filly with issues but she is in great shape i have given her two hard bits of work which have tightened her up nicely
5606975 i can imagine what the poor man went through when he first arrived its tough when you dont know anyone but it is a first class operation here with the staff mostly south africans
5606976 deep testing ground would be far from ideal for him the plan is still to run him but there is now a slight doubt well discuss the situation with the owners and make a decision after that
5606977 im a great believer in my horse hes tough and hes genuine a good horse can go on any ground its a clash of the titans and its a very hot race but although i respect them all i fear nothing
5606978 during my days one could break away and just go like i did at the 1968 olympic final which today remains my most memorable race
5606979 tomorrows todays final will be different tactics have changed a lot and many things will come into play
5606980 the most important thing is that the two kenyans must stay with the lead pack and wait until the last two laps before they can make any move things are very different now from what they were during our days
5606981 the blunder i made in the 1 500m was that i took off too early the two kenyans today should not do the same but be cautious until the final two laps
5606982 they should not go ahead too much must avoid being too deep in the pack because they will be blocked and they must also guard against running too wide because it will be hard to move in to the inside lane
5606983 we will plan as kenyans and make sure nothing goes wrong in the final i hope for the best
5606984 some of the guys ran off leaving one in the car
5606985 at the moment we are waiting for the insurance claim the wall has been made safe for the time being and should be fixed in a couple of weeks
5606986 according to the drinkers the car lost control and flipped over smashing into the car park brick wall
5606987 three passengers in the car extracted themselves and began fighting with the police as they tried to arrest them but they managed to get away
5606988 a police dog unit arrived from newbury at 9 45pm and positioned itself in the middle of wantage road as back up to help out those police at the spread eagle looking for those who had escaped from the smashed car
5606989 like something out of the movies you dont expect to see anything like this
5606990 drinkers managed to get the driver out and took him into the pub as more drinkers spilled out to view the wreckage
5606991 the police stayed until 11 30pm and a local breakdown lorry arrived to take the car away
5606992 two council workers arrived at midnight to clear the remaining pieces of the car
5606993 one fatality was a young cat crossing the road which was struck by a police vehicle
5606994 police had attended an incident at the same pub which they were leaving when they became aware of the car which was driving erratically
5606995 martin was seen to attend particular urinals to enable him to stand next to people even when there were plenty of free urinals available to use if he had in fact simply wished to use a urinal
5606996 he was also seen to move in and out of the general toilet area and enter cubicles for a short time and then emerge from the cubicles and attend the urinals again whereby he would stand next to a male and again look at the male whilst they were urinating
5606997 it was not his intention to find sexual gratification from watching people urinate what this amounts to is the case of a man looking for another willing partner to engage in casual homosexual sex
5606998 there was no complaint from any of the other people who were using the urinals at the time since his arrest hes stopped going into public toilets its had some salutary effect on how he looks for partners
5606999 i had not only found a remarkable family and the beginnings of a new form of documentary but a friend for life margaret wilkins
5607000 she may be gone in voice and body her finger will no longer wag at us do it my way or youll be sorry but her smile twinkling eyes quick wit and wise words will still forever be in our minds eye
5607001 a truly wise woman whom i shall always remember as margaret the family wilkins
5607002 it is a huge weight off our shoulders because it has been absolutely horrendous
5607003 when the case was thrown out it was a mixture of utter relief that justice had been done and absolute anger that the justice system allowed it to go this far
5607004 its been on our minds constantly to be called a racist was the worst of all it was more than i could bear
5607005 i have a black partner and i am well known within the asian community in reading
5607006 we lost our jobs because of this and our families have been worried sick back home in india
5607007 it was frightening to be locked in a police cell in a foreign country it has been like a nightmare
5607008 when we were arrested we were kept waiting in the cells for 11 hours
5607009 if the police had looked at the cctv closely they would have seen there was no case to answer
5607010 at the very least it was sheer incompetence but at its worst it was collusion
5607011 if we have a police force which doesnt follow procedures then this will happen again
5607012 we want to know why this case cost so much money and why it caused so much distress
5607013 we have been exonerated by the court but we cant just forget about this
5607014 we have been hurt so much its about time others were hurt

5607021 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5607022 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5607023 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5607024 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu
5607025 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5607026 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5607027 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5607028 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5607029 apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5607030 by now lindsay was sending i love you notes to samantha and signing them lindsay ronson but telling courtenay she loved her too
5607031 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5607032 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5607033 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha

5607043 todays music industry is either moribund or dead depending on whom you ask downloading has destroyed it and no one in the business is smart enough to figure out how to fix it
5607044 no one in the business is smart enough to fix it
5607045 in the era of the online music store even if you buy from itunes rather than stealing from limewire the problem is the same no one knows how to listen to a complete album anymore everything is slanted toward the hit single this means that the music industry is oriented toward one hit wonders rather than consummate musicians and talent development is just not worth the trouble
5607046 no one knows how to listen to a complete album anymore

5607051 since rock has long refused to sell his music as digital downloads fans who want to get
5607052 itunes is an old system where itunes takes the money the record company takes the money and they dont give it to the artists i was telling kids download it illegally i dont care i want you to hear my music so i can play live but i think they should steal everything
5607053 its definitely interesting that hes the only artist thats not available on itunes with a monster hit right now and were seeing that kind of a growth its certainly spurring a lot of debate in our company

5607204 i was in there to really try to be my best to prove im the best and to always improve and come out a better fighter
5607205 for my last two fights i was basically trying to coast i was trying to get in shape for the fights but i wasnt in there to really become a better fighter so thats really what i brought back to my focus my motivation

5607259 while agents provide a certain level of service there is nothing like having direct contact with customers and the service outlets will carry inventory and be staffed with salesman and trained brake installers
5607260 we are confident that when our marketing and sales network is rolled out on a broader scale it will result in higher sales and improved margins

5607277 on wednesday last week keepers noticed that claudio was very lethargic he hardly had anything to drink on friday and simply grew weaker and weaker he died on saturday
5607278 we cannot keep on taking away children from a mother
5607279 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5607280 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man from today the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5607281 he is looking forward to coming back he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters
5607282 he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart
5607283 for me it looks as if it came from old stocks as far as i am aware it is the first time they have used semtex

5607287 the russian troops have been very kind they give chocolates to the children and cigarettes to the men we are now afraid of what will happen if they leave we think that the ossetian militia will simply come in and there will be trouble we do not believe that the trouble is over it is frightening at night and we can hear gunfire in surrounding areas we need international forces here as soon as possible
5607288 at the outset you may be wondering why i have used the words claiming to be the head of state

5607336 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5607337 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5607338 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5607339 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5607340 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5607341 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

5607360 es ist ja bekannt dass wir mittlerweile auch in mittelzentren expandieren
5607361 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5607362 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5607363 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5607364 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5607365 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5607366 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5607367 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5607368 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5607369 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5607370 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5607371 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5607372 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5607373 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5607374 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5607375 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5607376 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5607377 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5607378 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5607379 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5607380 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5607381 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5607382 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5607383 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5607384 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5607385 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5607386 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5607387 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5607388 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5607389 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5607390 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5607391 this is a planning took where all things are going
5607392 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5607393 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5607394 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5607395 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5607396 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5607397 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5607398 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5607399 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5607400 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5607401 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5607402 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5607403 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5607404 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5607405 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5607406 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5607407 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5607408 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5607409 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5607410 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5607411 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5607412 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5607413 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5607414 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5607415 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5607416 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again

5607419 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5607420 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5607421 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

5607603 please cut off your battery power source entirely for fifteen minutes
5607604 mine is disconnected and we are working with the auroral current how do you receive my writing
5607605 better than with our batteries on current comes and goes gradually
5607606 my current is very strong at times and we can work better without the batteries as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately making current too strong at times for our relay magnets suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble

5607611 demand has been so much in the last couple of days that banks and other importers have run out of supplies

5607627 platinum has been buoyed by interest in the sector linked to xstratas bid for lonmin
5607628 it shows a more positive view of the platinum situation in south africa

5607633 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them

5607638 i have discovered this principle of life that when i want to do what is right i inevitably do what is wrong 22 i love gods law with all my heart a within me that is at war with my mind this power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me 24 oh what a miserable person i am who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death 25 thank god the answer is in jesus christ our lord so you see how it is in my mind i really want to obey gods law but because of my sinful nature i am a slave to sin

5607649 in the last few years after i learned about all that was happening around the world and how i contributed to it i chose to do something the things i knew could not be erased from my mind had i decided to turn the other way and ignore the facts i would have
5607650 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5607651 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5607652 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5607653 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5607654 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5607655 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5607656 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5607657 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5607658 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5607659 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5607660 were just happy to continue making the show as it is

5607662 a friendless mining sector is in need of a lifeline having pulled back 25 from the may peak citigroup analysts clarke wilkins and matthew hope admitted adding that global growth is
5607663 we remain bullish on gold with a 2009 price forecast of us 950 oz driven by a return of fabrication demand after the price correction wealth effects in developing nations and negative real interest rates
5607664 the underlying driver of commodity intensive infrastructure investment in developing countries remains unchanged short term risks remain but the opportunities are there for investors corporates that can look through the haze of negativity
5607665 the super cycle bull market for commodity stocks that has been underway since early this decade has not been a one way street with a number of meaningful corrections that have tested the resolve of the market
5607666 trading these spikes and troughs in the mining stocks is not without risks but is undeniably a highly rewarding strategy for those that are nimble enough and have the courage to look through the current negative haze surrounding the sector
5607667 the only reason for not stepping up and buying the sector after this recent correction is a belief that the cycle is not well and truly over and commodity prices will fall further
5607668 this point is critical as china is after all the key driver of the commodity super cycle
5607669 economic policy post the olympics will be key it seems likely that the government will continue to selectively stimulate
5607670 they are dragging their feet in forcing these banks to reserve realistically some of these banks could have been closed two or three quarters earlier
5607671 in some of these cases i believe regulators should act sooner than later to prevent future losses to the fund
5607672 the failures so far this year will drain the fdics insurance fund by an estimated 9 2 billion
5607673 love is that first feeling you feel before all the bad stuff gets in the way

5607679 love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him to make sure the taste is ok
5607680 love is when you kiss all the time then when you get tired of kissing you still want to be together and you talk more my mommy and daddy are like that they look gross when they kiss but they look happy and sometimes they dance in the kitchen while kissing
5607681 love is whats in the room with you at christmas if you stop opening presents and listen
5607682 if you want to learn to love better you should start with a friend who you hate
5607683 love is hugging love is kissing love is saying no
5607684 when you tell someone something bad about yourself and youre scared she wont love you anymore but then you get surprised because not only does she still love you she loves you even more
5607685 there are 2 kinds of love our love gods love but god makes both kinds of them
5607686 love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt then he wears it everyday
5607687 love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after theyve know each other so well
5607688 during my piano recital i was on a stage and scared i looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling he was the only one doing that i wasnt scared anymore
5607689 love is if you hold hands and sit beside each other in the cafeteria that means youre in love otherwise you can sit across from each other and be okay
5607690 my mommy loves me more than anybody you dont see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night

5607693 love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than robert redford
5607694 if you want somebody to love you then just be yourself some people try to act like somebody else somebody the boy likes better i think the boy isnt being very good if he does this to you and you should just find a nicer boy
5607695 love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day
5607696 when youre born and see your mommy for the first time
5607697 love is what makes people hide in the dark corners of movie theaters
5607698 love goes on even when you stop breathing and you pick up where you left off when you reach heaven
5607699 i know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones
5607700 you really shouldnt say i love you unless you mean it but if you mean it you should say it a lot people forget
5607701 you have to fall in love before you get married then when youre married you just sit around and read books together
5607702 i let my big sister pick on me because my mom says she only picks on me because she loves me so i pick on my baby sister because i love her

5607707 scegliere il gioco che si preferisce e copiare il codice tramite il tasto
5607708 good t how are you what are you up to
5607709 i was at the library and decided to walk over here for lunch thought id do something different and relaxing
5607710 i was out all night with a hot sexy guy and just ran in to grab some oysters so i can feed them to him in bed when he wakes up did you know oysters are an aphrodisiac thought i would grab some for our 100th round of hot passionate sex
5607711 well i just ordered come sit here and join me im alone too we might as well make a group besides i just ordered m can add it so well get it at the same time
5607712 anyhow one would wonder whats the relation between the mi franchise and dr gardners mi
5607713 an intelligence is the ability to solve problems or to create products that are valued within one or more cultural settings
5607714 you look like a rattlesnake walking front of me with all that swerving
5607715 we are going to play 10 hours of sad chick flicks so remove all knives from the kitchen and ropes from the garage

5607720 man i am sure glad i have the group of students i have
5607721 t d was just here did you guys see each other
5607722 dont tell d but i was just checking you out i didnt realize it was you with the hair
5607723 calm down youll be fine just slowly shuffle past her
5607724 oh yeah thats definitely a black widow web like i was lying where did it go
5607725 to equate what i said with what this racist bigot has said from the pulpit is unbelievable
5607726 he gave a very good speech on race relations but he did not address the fact that this man is up there spewing hatred
5607727 what this man is doing is he is spewing that stuff out to young people and to younger people than obama and putting it in their heads that its ok to say goddamn america and its ok to beat up on white people
5607728 but more than a day after the scandal broke sen hillary rodham clinton and other senior democrats in the delegation had yet call on spitzer to quit
5607729 there is an incompatibility between this tool and the current operating system unable to continue
5607730 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
5607731 this is very important for people to know i hope you are going to succeed
5607732 we really need this now and it is quite timely with what is going on in the news and how the world is awakening to it good for you
5607733 why do they need to make these girls so stupid
5607734 they act like dumb bimbos flocking like idiots to young boys who are acting as if the world belongs to them
5607735 would you do such thing flocking to a boy all together and flapping your eyelids at them like that
5607736 do you think it is right that the boy flicks his fingers and tells the girls to walk away
5607737 do you think it is right for hannah montana to boss the other girls around asking them to laugh or act in particular way on and on it went i deleted all the recorded shows and canceled the program she understood agreed and didnt fight us
5607738 is the death or suffering of a child today more important than the death or suffering of a child twenty five or fifty years from now
5607739 nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change
5607740 i do something similar to what mark does but in a cheaper way i tell people to turn the switch off
5607741 id actually pay to buy a ticket for that one
5607742 who else was up there patrick ewing so patrick david and karl malone that would be interesting
5607743 the world is embracing the sport that the dream teamers brought to barcelona
5607744 and i would say the 2008 olympics really demonstrate that complete embrace
5607745 you know i didnt even dare to think about that
5607746 the question was one step at a time if youve been along on the journey sometimes you dont realize how far youve come
5607747 that would be a separate league that would be nba affiliated or nba sponsored but it would be independent
5607748 and it would just sign players for a very long time to come it would be at a lower scale than the nba but as the sport develops in china and as more players around the world recognize the opportunities of playing in china we see that league growing and strengthening
5607749 i think that that is likely to become a regular thing
5607750 coming out of athens there was just more of a focus at every level on the game and the representation of ones country and were just doing a better job collectively on that front
5607751 i think that i would encourage usa basketball and the nba players to focus upon longer than bringing a group together
5607752 i think that commitment is not just about the teamwork but also about the international discipline that comes from basketball diplomacy and our players are learning their lessons well
5607753 however despite the adverse economic conditions affecting much of the globe consumers continued to increase their spending on gold jewellery
5607754 seharusnya ada sinergi antara penegakan hukum dan pengembalian aset negara yang hilang
5607755 karena itu kita merekomendasikan agar para penegak hukum mengkaji ulang strategi pemberantasan korupsi sinergi antara penegakan hukum dan pengembalian aset sera pengawasan pelayanan publik
5607756 saya menilai pemberantasan korupsi lebih dititikberatkan pada kuantitas daripada kualitas akibatnya korupsi masih berjalan
5607757 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity
5607758 believe in the lord jesus and you and your household will be saved
5607759 you deny my existence for all these years teach others that i dont exist and even credit creation to some cosmic accident do you expect me to help you out of this predicament can i count on you as a believer
5607760 it would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a christian now but perhaps you could make the bear a christian
5607761 blesss us o lord for these thy gifts which we are about to receive through thy bounty through christ the lord amen
5607762 of course ill come to school just so as i do not inconvenience you in any way you can puch me down the hallway in a wheelchair
5607763 gee its your turn to give me a challenge but i didnt want to insult your intelligence by telling you outright
5607764 if it is not the first 20 things that pop to your head i lose and i must stand on my head for 8 minutes
5607765 i dont think that its a sticking point as such
5607766 weve actually got a model that weve prepared and theyre the players are more excited because they can actually see and visualise what the facilitys going to look like
5607767 i just wanted to send you a quick note and let you know that bill and i went to a cake tasting at bakery gingham the cake and especially the frosting did not disappoint we were both floored by how delicious it was thank you for the recommendation we have not decided on the flavor yet amanda said that we will meet about 6 weeks before the wedding to decide good thing because i would have chosen each of the 6 types we tested they were all phenomenal
5607768 amandas life long love of baking and arts and crafts finally found a place to blossom when she decided to fulfill her dreams and launch bakery gingham
5607769 a delicate coconut cupcake finished with vanilla buttercream icing we then dust it with coconut flakes

5607781 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5607782 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5607783 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling

5607791 if people only knew how hard i work to gain my mastery it wouldnt seem so wonderful at all

5607793 opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work

5607806 kim bum soo feat yoo bin do you know that
5607807 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5607808 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5607809 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5607810 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5607811 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5607812 we were all set and then the georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted
5607813 russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in south ossetia and abkhazia
5607814 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict

5607821 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5607822 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5607823 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5607824 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment
5607825 i spent the day on the bluffs just starting out at france and just getting mentally prepared
5607826 its hard to get sleep when youve been dreaming about this for 25 years
5607827 by this time i was in the shipping lane along the english coast
5607828 so there were some pretty big ships that came within 500 metres of me and i had to battle through the bow waves that they send what was key at this point was to ensure that my stomach contents remained in my body
5607829 once i saw the coast i thought now i can put my head down and work
5607830 i had heard of swimmers getting to within 400 metres and then the currents pushing them back out into the middle of the channel
5607831 i had done a lot of visualization for many years on what this experience would be like so it was very emotional
5607832 i could see those sands of france there is the goal its staring me right in the face so just enjoy these last 400 metres
5607833 it was just a complete sense of accomplishment the magnitude of this challenge didnt sink in until the next day
5607834 this is a mega leader in the community i think its exciting
5607835 ive got a lot of support im really flattered but still i have lots of questions to answer
5607836 a year before the election they suddenly need a candidate
5607837 whenever we have a concern we can call the vision councillors and they answer in the recent past they have been involved in our day to day events with the npa council we were thinking these people were from another planet
5607838 there is an inherent risk in any activities that people take part in and its unfortunate when these things happen but for the number of people we have rafting its more dangerous to ride your bicycle down the street than it is to go rafting with a commercial operation in the province
5607839 i am talking of odds against chance of hundreds of thousands to one
5607840 and just for the record i know a thing or two about statistics i have a phd from glasgow university on statistical ecology and a further 33 years working on
5607841 did you know that the distribution of olympic swimming medallists against the tropical astrological zodiac signs can be almost exactly mapped by a polynomial function of the third degree
5607842 no one wants to see the devastation i saw my friend and his family go through we have to lend our support to this campaign
5607843 you dont expect situations that are happening whereby people go to school in the morning and then you never see them again
5607844 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to it is unfortunate it is part of life part of culture these days and this is why we want to get involved we want to make a change
5607845 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives
5607846 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5607847 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5607848 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential
5607849 before the conflict with french authorities is settled and before he gets an apology from the french side neither onexim nor prokhorov himself would do any business in france
5607850 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5607851 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5607852 he is stunned by this situation he feels like hes lost his daughter
5607853 my client wants to appeal so no other parents will live through the same thing
5607854 father doesnt know best court rules in girls fight to get grounding overruled
5607855 good bread is the most fundamentally satisfying of all foods and good
5607856 its my hope all these projects are going to go over the next few years
5607857 the people here work in the mills log the forests and drive the trucks what is going to happen when those jobs vanish
5607858 theres always going to be some impact but we think it can be mitigated
5607859 there is a huge snow pack there with an average annual snowfall of 1 100 centimetres and its just two hours from the lower mainland
5607860 weve talked to the city of merritt and the province and believe there is opportunity there that can be a win for everyone
5607861 what goes on through someones mind in this day and age god knows
5607862 it was friday night it was sunny it was hot it was just one of those things lets take them up the street up by the pitch and putt
5607863 if its poison then its most likely this is the stuff
5607864 theres always been a bitter friction between people who have dogs and use parks and those that think animals should be kept out of parks or have a problem with dogs
5607865 there are people who do get upset about dogs who dont like dogs who are fearful of dogs who resent having dogs in the park but it would be pretty frightening to think that someone was going to take that in their hands and poison an animal
5607866 shes not one of these dogs that ive seen thats running around and a big nuisance and so on and so forth
5607867 i have a three year old daughter and kids are around the house all the time its almost like a petting zoo
5607868 she said her dog never gets sick and her dog was throwing up foam
5607869 except i suddenly had an incredible capacity to draw anything out of the blue with no references
5607870 okay kid heres your shot go draw the next issue of fantastic four

5607888 it was first discovered in devon in the early 1990s and no one is really sure how it got here

5607897 in iranian law we dont have execution edam for persons under 18 years of age what we have in the laws for persons between 15 to 18 is the issue of retribution qesas
5607898 not to apply any provisions or articles of the convention that are incompatible with islamic laws
5607899 broad and imprecise nature of the state partys irans general reservation potentially negates many of the conventions provision and raises concern as to its compatibility with the object and purpose of the convention
5607900 this case epitomizes the vulnerability of the iranian people and particularly juveniles in a system without due process and the rule of law and which ignores the world regarding juvenile executions irans judiciary must halt this execution now
5607901 iran is executing several children every year despite the fact that it is banned under international law
5607902 it is cruel and inhumane to apply the death penalty even to adults let alone to those convicted for crimes committed before the age of 18
5607903 execution of persons who were under the age of 18 at the time their offence was committed contrary to the obligations of the islamic republic of iran under article 37 of the convention on the rights of the child and article 6 of the international covenant on civil and political rights
5607904 irans insistence on executing juvenile offenders in the face of international law and international protests portrays an image of a judicial system bent on the application of state violence against juvenile offenders but unconcerned about justice or international law
5607905 the lord has seen that i am not loved so he has given me this son
5607906 after ten years of repression the authorities are still not willing to acknowledge the legitimate rights of student activists and their organizations recent detentions are evidently orchestrated to silence and intimidate the academic community
5607907 it is ironic that human rights activists trying to follow up on arbitrary detentions are themselves victims of such methods
5607908 the government is in effect imprisoning these people inside the country preventing their freedom of movement in an effort to keep their voices from international audiences
5607909 denying momeni to travel to this forum is a barometer of the human rights situation in iran that will not escape the notice of participants the iranian government has no justification whatsoever in preventing its citizens from participating in and contributing to such conferences

5607940 no one can accept that hana abdis trial was anything other than a farce
5607941 hana abdi was tried and convicted on trumped up security charges apparently to punish her for her peaceful and legal work on behalf of equal rights and to deter others from exercising their rights
5607942 talking about human rights is not a crime in iran
5607943 if a law abiding 21 year old student can be arrested and convicted of such serious crimes with no evidence having been provided and without benefit of a legal defense then no rule of law exists in iran and no iranian citizen is secure

5607949 mehrnehads prosecution and trial were a farce and we are left with an impression of a justice system in the hands of those bent on repression by instilling fear a system that does not value human life or the truth
5607950 state sanctioned murder of a civilian without evidence of any crime but justified on the basis of being a
5607951 to ensure justice and protect the integrity of the judiciary itself
5607952 it appears that the result of this trial was prepared in advance and that the trial was staged in order to give the appearance of a proper legal process leading to this result the procedure and trial regrettably suggest political motivations on the part of his accusers and failure or unwillingness by the courts independently to assess guilt or innocence
5607953 recruiting individuals to attend conferences abroad with the aim of overthrowing the system
5607954 as long as these detainees are held in incommunicado detention as long as they are deprived of access to their lawyers and families and as long as no conclusive evidence is presented against them in a public court there will be no justice delivered in their prosecution
5607955 mr hadad claims that all of these detainees have accepted the charges against them after months of incommunicado detention and complete lack of due process these so called confessions would lack any validity in a proper court of law
5607956 seven bahais formed an illegal group and had some connections with countries such as israel and received orders from them to act against the system this led to their detention and they have accepted all their charges including connections with israel
5607957 the government knew perfectly well about the existence of this committee long before its members were arrested just as the government knows perfectly well that these people are not involved in any underhanded activity
5607958 they have been involved in organizing gatherings on topics such as aids that has received attention from domestic and international ngos they acted to recruit individuals to travel abroad with the aim of training them on overthrowing the system they were well aware of their activities and topics of trainings such as velvet revolutions

5607966 american christianity is entering the most exciting era in our lifetime
5607967 that loud crack heard throughout the evangelical world when national research showed that more than half of american evangelicals believe people of other religions can go to heaven wasnt thunder from an angry god this crack came from the rock upon which the modern american evangelical movement sits it was splitting right down the middle the universalist evangelical finding which came from the pew forums u s religious landscape survey was one more sign that american christianity is entering the most exciting era in our lifetime some people believe a new awakening is at hand others believe a reformation is in the making no one knows how long it will take or how far it will go whats clear is that people in the pews are taking back their faith wresting it from leaders who helped sell the idea that only the most fundamentalist brands of christian belief could succeed and that their words alone represented that belief
5607968 theyre admitting what their own studies show that evangelicals almost never convert a native born american who wasnt raised in a church that most evangelical growth comes from stealing the sheep from other denominations and that theyve stolen about all they can

5608028 i understand that senator obama said that if al qaeda established a base in iraq that he would send troops back in militarily al qaeda already has a base in iraq its called al qaeda in iraq
5608029 for the first time in american political history a candidate for president has called for surrender and raised the white flag
5608030 al qaeda is stronger than anytime since 2001 according to our own intelligence estimates and we are bogged down in a war that john mccain now suggests might go on for another 100 years spending 12 billion a month that could be invested in the kinds of programs that both senator clinton and i are talking about
5608031 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

5608049 filled with scenes of heroic bloodshed black lagoon is action incarnate rokuro okajima is meek mundane and metropolitan his business trip to south east asia turns from pleasure cruise to festival of pain when modern day pirates board the ship and take him hostage revy dutch and benny are merciless maniacal and mean together they make up the crew of the black lagoon they are the exact opposite of rokuro in every way but one a mercenary group out has targeted them to steal the data disc that rokuro had and with it classified information that threatens the peace and security of the entire world amen hallelujah peanut butter
5608050 but only during those moments taking on the nickname of rock rokuro starts his new life as a member of the lagoon company the show provides a good two episode introduction to the concept and then shifts into a pair of standalone stories that help to build up the relationships of the characters and the setting where its a rough and tumble world of bad guys rocks time with dutch and the others begins to unearth some of their quirks but it tends to be rock who is the most interesting as he adapts to it still keeping his white shirt and tie on he takes on a real business role within the small company and plays it straight while you have revy getting all psychotic and ready to kill the dynamic of the group is positively hilarious and works to great effect as a whole package there is a lot to like about this series madhouse has done an outstanding job with the animation and adapting the character designs with lots of open sea vistas that shift to rundown sections of the town they live in everything has a sense of realness to it and plenty of detail scenes of the lagoon racing across the open waters on our 70
5608051 now user acquisition is the biggest focus for us in the next year or so we want to be known as the global company which has an international presence
5608052 all services of this kind have more than a million users so when we reach that critical mass we would have reached a major milestone
5608053 after we reach that point we plan to form strategic partnerships for merchandising also various companies can have their timelines on lifeblob which can be used by them to target the audiences which fit their customer profile

5608055 till now we were controlling how we grow but since last week we have opened up our membership to everyone
5608056 also the idea is a little ahead of its time for india but this seems to be a perfect time for this service to be targeting a market in the us and uk

5608075 assessing the condition of oil related infrastructure cleaning up oil spills or other environmental damage at oil facilities engineering design and repair or reconstruction of damaged infrastructure assisting in making facilities operational distribution of petroleum products and assisting the iraqis in resuming iraqi oil company operations
5608076 the fact that the department was planning for the possibility that it would need to repair and provide for continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure was classified until march 2003
5608077 this prevented earlier acknowledgement or announcement of potential requirements to the business community
5608078 contingent on informing wh white house tomorrow we anticipate no issues since action has been coordinated w vps vice presidents office
5608079 the most blatant and improper contract abuse i have witnessed during the course of my professional career
5608080 the u s considered such contingency planning necessary because of saddam husseins actions in kuwait in 1991 when iraqi forces damaged 750 wells
5608081 that destruction resulted in an environmental disaster as well as a tremendous blow to kuwaits oil production capability
5608082 from behind the obsidian mirrors of his wraparound sunglasses ray rodon surveys the vast desert landscape of southern iraqs rumailah oilfield a project manager with halliburtons engineering and construction division kellogg brown amp root rodon has spent months preparing for the daunting task of repairing iraqs oil industry working first at headquarters in houston and then out of a hotel room in kuwait city he has studied the intricacies of the iraqi national oil company even reviewing the firms organizational charts so that halliburton and the army can ascertain which iraqis are reliable technocrats and which are saddam loyalists
5608083 rodon represents the vanguard of what is expected to be a growing army of halliburton employees in iraq where the u s is preparing to embark on the grandest exercise in nation building since its occupation of japan after world war ii at the center of that undertaking will be u s companies with halliburton probably chief among them
5608084 indeed texans wearing kbr baseball caps are arriving by the planeload at kuwaits airport
5608085 the liberation of iraq couldnt come at a better time for halliburton whose business has been dogged by a host of troubles from a slowdown in domestic oil production to nightmare asbestos litigation last year revenues declined 6 to 12 6 billion and the company reported a net loss of 984 million but ceo dave lesar who took over when his predecessor dick cheney went to washington is starting to put halliburtons problems behind it he has cut costs sold unproductive assets curtailed money losing overseas operations and devised a bold plan to settle asbestos related lawsuits
5608086 the dod through its us army logistics civil augmentation program logcap iii contract with kbr tapped the company in november 2002 to develop the contingency plan implementation of the plan is being executed through a separate contract kellogg brown amp root now holds with the us army corps of engineers
5608087 kbr was selected for the iraq contract based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice

5608106 children have much fascination for games and sports if we make special provision for games and sports and promote it in a systematic manner it can help us to increase the enrolment of children and check the drop out rates
5608107 the children will learn subjects like health and physical education they will also participate in various sports activities adequate equipment will be provided to each schools to involve students in sports activities
5608108 china is doing very well in olympics because the children are trained in games and sports from childhood if such efforts are started india will be able to produce good sports persons
5608109 it came at 2 02 pm three quarters of an hour into a speech that kept the nation on tenterhooks president musharraf bowed to the inevitable and announced his resignation here at last was the moment the overwhelming majority of the countrys politicians had been hoping for
5608110 most will wonder why it took the president so long some will rue the lost opportunity to impeach him what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5608111 the large number of children coming into contact with the legal system mostly as a result of abuse cases has motivated intense scientific effort to understand childrens true and false reports
5608112 the seriousness of abuse charges and the frequency with which childrens testimony provides central prosecutorial evidence makes childrens eyewitness memory abilities important considerations arguably even more important however are adults abilities to evaluate childrens reports
5608113 the area is crowded with machinery and printing factories shops restaurants and houses

5608128 doch die l nderpolitiker verzichten lieber auf die notwendige verringerung der feinstaub und klimabelastungen durch den stra eng terverkehr um sich auf kosten der b rger im bayrischen wahlkampf und bei der spediteurslobby zu profilieren

5608133 its hard to go that way because then a different referee could bring out a yellow card for your players at the moment the players and the referee are not on the same page
5608134 its an irb rule but i dont know why we cant discuss these things before the game
5608135 both coaches should be there the day before a game to speak to the referee
5608136 these days there are so many different interpretations of the laws all you want is clarity from the ref you want to know before hand you want him to tell you this is how i see it
5608137 im kind of caught between the devil and the deep blue sea but we cant back off now were at 60 per cent of where we want to be so we have to bite the bullet and see if we can get there

5608171 maka parmalim dengan demikian merupakan orang orang mengutamakan kesucian dalam hidupnya
5608172 mereka masyarakat awam dan pemerintah tidak mengerti siapa sebenarnya yang kami sembah dan luhurkan

5608191 variance films will represent the best of the old thinking and the best of the new adapting both to the reality of todays marketplace
5608192 while there is no shortage of independent films being made today there are far too many noteworthy films that are struggling to find distribution and often winding up going straight to video variance films is designed to take these smaller films to theaters tailoring each release to the specific film for the specific us markets even when it doesnt fit the standard theatrical ny la expansion model and we will have a strong acquisitions component so well soon be a staple at festivals and markets chasing after films we believe in
5608193 with brendan fraser and sarah michelle gellar has been distributing films for several years and developed a reputation for finding smaller films with breakout potential
5608194 variance films and dylan marchettis passion and commitment to the powerful message sent by walking on dead fish and the people of new orleans made my decision to walk away from traditional distribution easy belief in making our country a better place through the medium of film how rare
5608195 walking on dead fish is a great example of the kind of movie that would slip through the cracks if released in a rote fashion
5608196 its not a new york or los angeles kind of movie at first glance it needs to get some momentum behind it and were going to do that by opening it in football country and slowly expanding it we want the buzz to drive us into the major markets rather than the other way around

5608209 teachers should focus on their students expectations and needs and get support from colleagues if they feel overwhelmed but not try to make overly demanding parents happy

5608214 oooh yet again hillary is so cold and emotionally flat oooh what a strange person she is

5608236 it is also disputed whether the happy man will need friends or not it is said that those who are supremely happy and self sufficient have no need of friends for they have the things that are good and therefore being self sufficient they need nothing further while a friend being another self furnishes what a man cannot provide by his own effort whence the saying when fortune is kind what need of friends but it seems strange when one assigns all good things to the happy man not to assign friends who are thought the greatest of external goods and if it is more characteristic of a friend to do well by another than to be well done by and to confer benefits is characteristic of the good man and of virtue and it is nobler to do well by friends than by strangers the good man will need people to do well by this is why the question is asked whether we need friends more in prosperity or in adversity on the assumption that not only does a man in adversity need people to confer benefits on him but also those who are prospering need people to do well by surely it is strange too to make the supremely happy man a solitary for no one would choose the whole world on condition of being alone since man is a political creature and one whose nature is to live with others therefore even the happy man lives with others for he has the things that are by nature good and plainly it is better to spend his days with friends and good men than with strangers or any chance persons therefore the happy man needs friends

5608247 the parties involved in this conflict are not merely abolitionists and slaveholders they are atheists jacobeans red republicans and agnostics on one side and the friends of order and regulated freedom on the other
5608248 as i view the contest it is no less than a contest for the advancement of the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of satan
5608249 the war for freedom in the confederacy is more than just a contest for civil liberties it is a war for religion it is a war against infidels it is a war by gods chosen nation for gods plan for the universe

5608270 can use overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
5608271 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message and thats its military power
5608272 thats not the way to deal in the 21st century
5608273 a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5608274 nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coasts so this effort to somehow assert russian power or influence by military means is something that weve been seeing for a while
5608275 it cant act in the way it did when it was the cold war and it was the soviet union and expect to be treated as a responsible partner
5608276 the kind of language russia uses about poland isnt tolerable
5608277 when people reach out a hand of friendship its really not responsible language to threaten them with nuclear attack as apparently some unnamed russian general apparently did
5608278 mounting evidence that russian and georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the south ossetian conflict
5608279 ongoing militia attacks and a growing humanitarian crisis also indicate the urgent need for the deployment of a mission to enhance civilian protection
5608280 deploy a robust european defense agency mission consisting of police and security forces to ensure protection of civilians and the return of displaced persons to their homes
5608281 clearly absent some other substantial evidence it is difficult to get in the mind of an individual officer
5608282 this is not to be interpreted as a finding that racial profiling discrimination or bias policing does not occur however it is difficult to sustain these complaints
5608283 we frankly have a continuing divide between where the department is and where members of the community are
5608284 i am not suggesting every single person who thinks they were stopped because they were black is accurate but it is a continuing perception in los angeles and this country and that perception is a reality in the minds of many people
5608285 whatever other departments do the fact remains there have been 1 100 complaints of racial profiling against the lapd and zero have been sustained over the last five years
5608286 its not realistic to believe that racial profiling never happens in the lapd
5608287 i dont think the members of minority communities for whom racial profiling is very real will feel at all comforted in the knowledge that other departments dont sustain complaints at high rates
5608288 proving a claim of racial profiling is very hard from a single complaint you cant say its racial profiling
5608289 profiling means that its an inherent pattern of an officer targeting someone of that race
5608290 eu nunca tinha pensado em fazer um blog antes mas percebi que algumas notas que fazia no jornal o dia estavam ficando velhas por sugest o de um amigo criei um blog
5608291 hoje em dia trabalho mais do que quando estava numa reda o acostumei meus leitores a dez doze atualiza es di rias e sou cobrado para que continue assim
5608292 foi a pior li o que tive nesses 40 anos de jornalismo recebi muitas cr ticas que falavam como um jornalista pode publicar algo sem checar sem apurar a internet cobra muito mais isso a quest o da checagem e apura o das informa es
5608293 os jornalistas transcrevem as falas dos pol ticos e n o se preocupam em explicar o que aquilo quer dizer como vai afetar a vida do cidad o
5608294 no meu blog tenho a preocupa o de tentar descomplicar as coisas porque a pol tica est presente em todas as nossas a es e decide coisas que nos afetam diretamente
5608295 my understanding is she will be brought in in a sheriffs vehicle from her home
5608296 it is the city attorneys position that the decision on whether or not ms hilton should be released early and placed on electronic monitoring should be made by judge sauer and not the sheriffs department
5608297 i want to thank the los angeles county sheriffs department and staff of the century regional detention center for treating me fairly and professionally
5608298 i am going to serve the remaining 40 days of my sentence i have learned a great deal from this ordeal and hope that others have learned from my mistakes
5608299 she would have gotten out early if she was plain jane
5608300 she did as much time as a normal person would have done
5608301 the time and resources needed to take care of a paris hilton are huge
5608302 they have to make sure she is safe and her medical needs are attended to everything they did was going to be looked at under a microscope
5608303 the crowd made me feel like im part of the yankees already
5608304 i dont feel like i have to do anything necessarily to win them over
5608305 i have to win and bobby has to win and alex has to win and i still think jason has to win
5608306 no matter how much youre made to feel part of the team when you come here you start pressing and one big swing helped me relax
5608307 but we havent won yet winning a world series is hard weve been to the playoffs every year and you need to win there
5608308 youre a yankee when you put on the uniform and compete alongside these guys here as far as what the fans seem to sense as a coming out its something like that yeah

5608311 i still think about you everyday whenever this guy at work plays halogen i get goosebumps thinking of you gives me goosebumps ive never had goosebumps this much in my life

5608313 oh i dont know what do you want to do
5608314 grape juice can have a similar effect against heart disease as red wine but without the alcohol that is a very important message
5608315 but not every grape juice has the beneficial effect it has to have a high level of polyphenols
5608316 we have information on more than 100 different kinds of wine and the amount of polyphenols what we know is that the most protective ones have the highest levels of polyphenols that is established
5608317 that might seem like a good sign but if we look back at the past ten years its a bitter failure
5608318 after that the g2e government to enterprise model was developed and became the foundation for hcm citys e government planning
5608319 project 112 exposed many problems but was also the inspiration for current plans and ambitions hcm city decided to develop its own style of e government in late 2004
5608320 e government can and probably will fail without marketing because people are either unaware that it exists or dont know how to use it
5608321 the sooner vietnam develops successful e government the sooner it can move ahead to the next step at every level from private citizens to major enterprises to global politics

5608429 if you have written about why verizon can cheerfully trumpet fios all over the airwaves but still doesnt have it in the city and wont say when it will be there i missed the story
5608430 while weve not announced plans to offer fios tv in baltimore city to date it remains a very important market to us
5608431 were in the middle of a massive transformational upgrade of our infrastructure and we simply cannot be everywhere at once
5608432 were working hard to bring the benefits of our fiber technology to as many people as quickly as possible
5608433 but as with all new technology this will take time as well as investment to accomplish
5608434 verizon has not yet begun franchise negotiations with baltimore city

5608436 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god
5608437 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5608438 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5608439 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5608446 the problem was the overall market sentiment we did investigate whether reducing the price but the market simply was not interested
5608447 the problem facing juniors is they have small assets and require deep shafts which poses a high risk in terms of completion
5608448 their projects require high capex difficult technology long lead times and this is risky for investors
5608449 i expect that there is unashamedly going to be consolidation among juniors in platinum
5608450 platinum is looking attractive compared to other investments such as equities bonds and cash
5608451 institutional investors are invested in cash right now while their other investments are low many of them have been in platinum since the price soared from 700 ounce and are still holding the issue is that if they take profits in platinum they have to reinvest the money elsewhere and there are few attractive investments at the moment

5608467 the suspension will also enable the acceleration of feasibility studies into the energy conversion project to switch the operations power source from oil to coal and the development of the loma miranda project which will provide a new higher grade mining area for falcondo and extend the mine life

5608481 access to the president doesnt mean youre going to get the truth
5608482 he never really aspired to be president but lightning struck
5608483 he turned out to be a good president because he really restored confidence in the oval office and a sense of security in the country after watergate
5608484 missed his calling he would have been a great minister
5608485 they reagan advisers james baker ed meese and michael deaver taught him to say this is not a press conference they had him quite trained on that
5608486 at the tail end both he and mrs bush began to think we were the cause of all their troubles so the press was not liked at all
5608487 clinton was denied his legitimacy as president by the ultra right in this country
5608488 he was asked so many personal questions no president has ever been subjected to that kind of tyranny
5608489 theres a blackout now i believe until the end of his term

5608502 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5608503 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5608504 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5608505 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5608506 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5608507 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5608508 es zahlt sich aus sich beim einkauf von schul startpaketen zeit zu lassen und zu vergleichen wer klug kauft kann g nstig kaufen und sich viel geld ersparen denn es macht einen gro en unterschied ob ich im papierhandel 184 euro daf r zahle oder nur rund 46
5608509 das verr ckte und absolut sinnlose handyverbot von vp b rgermeister siegfried nagl wird fallen sp testens mit 18 september ist das absurdeste kapitel der grazer stadtgeschichte abgeschlossen diese undurchdachte ma nahme hat nichts gebracht und kein problem in graz gel st ganz im gegenteil wurde durch nagls alleingang nur ein unn tiger generationenkonflikt heraufbeschworen f r menschen die tats chlich und tagt glich unter l rm wie baustellen verkehrs oder arbeitsl rm zu leiden haben war nagls handyverbot ohnedies eine regelrechte ja fast zynische verh hnung
5608510 dort wo andere menschen ein r ckgrat haben haben die gr nen allein wenn man sich ihre t glich ndernde meinung zum handyverbot ansieht einen gartenschlauch ich hoffe dass wenigsten diesmal r ckers ank ndigung h lt und die gr nen gemeinsam mit sp fp und kp unserem antrag zum fall des handyverbotes zustimmen werden
5608511 ich glaube es ist durchaus sinnvoll das ohnedies berh hte gehalt des b rgermeisters zur abdeckung der finanziellen sch den heranzuziehen
5608512 ziel der politik der stadt graz muss es wieder sein sich mit den wesentlichen problemen des darniederliegenden ffentlichen verkehrs zu besch ftigen anstatt scheindiskussionen ber jeglicher grundlage entbehrender verbote zu f hren
5608513 handelsketten sind zwar im schnitt billiger als der papier fachhandel aber das gilt nicht generell preise zu vergleichen lohnt sich
5608514 es ist unfassbar nun alte und kranke pensionisten dem risiko eines berfalles auszusetzen
5608515 hier wird offenkundig dass man der kriminalit t in diesem lande offenbar nicht mehr herr wird weshalb man das risiko von berf llen auch nicht mehr l nger tragen m chte
5608516 ich verlange von den verantwortlichen stellen sofort entsprechende ma nahmen und verwehre mich gegen ein abschieben des risikos auf jene die oftmals die schw chsten in unserer gesellschaft sind

5608520 she particularly mentioned countries which havent been directly included in the eu neighbourhood policy so far
5608521 we will suggest that the eu presidency arranges for a conference of the eu and within the framework of the neighbourhood policy the neighbouring states in the south caucasus and the region
5608522 we are serious there is a red line the red line is the withdrawal of the troops they must withdraw the troops
5608523 at a given moment we will be faced with ultimatums
5608524 today in line with the plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers has begun
5608525 there is a distinction between the understandings of a pullback and a withdrawal in the conversation with french president sarkozy the discussion was about a pullback of forces not a withdrawal
5608526 the technical agreement gives unmik the united nations mission in kosovo the green light for transferring assets to us
5608527 as with every similar provocation this technical move cannot be ignored and the government will submit a protest to the un security council you cant go about it the eulex transfer this way
5608528 brussels plans to have eulex enter kosovo through that process we are aware of this and it is illegal
5608529 russia will give you the most energetic support in this
5608530 we continue to have great respect for creative teams and products and are hopeful that we can work together to reach a mutually agreed transaction
5608531 we think that take two management understands its lack of leverage particularly given the dearth of other bidders
5608532 if take two management remains realistic and negotiates a price below 27 50 we expect a deal to get done

5608542 hemos tenido dos atletas en los puestos cuarto y quinto no puedo quejarme han estado en la carrera y han dado un buen espect culo
5608543 pero hac a 41 grados al sol eran las peores condiciones posibles para l aunque este a o nos hemos preparado mucho en calor

5608546 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5608547 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5608548 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5608565 sie werden nicht einem unternehmen folgen dessen gesch ftsmodell kaputt ist wenn es also nicht so wirkt dass wir einer l sung entgegensteuern sind wir erledigt
5608566 unsere k nstler und rechteinhaber verdienen gerecht f r das blut und den schwei entlohnt zu werden die das kernprodukt dieser unternehmen bilden
5608567 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5608568 it didnt take that long for the russian forces to get in and it really shouldnt take that long for them to get out
5608569 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5608570 a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5608571 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organization like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999
5608572 we dont want to hear that saakashvili is a saint
5608573 unfortunately we were caught in the last friday critical mass ride
5608574 everyone in tokyo rides bicycles i did almost all of my grocery shopping by bike on my housewife bike during the 7 years i lived there i love to ride a bike in the old fashioned sense of that phrase for pleasure not competition people routinely ring their bells in japan when they are coming up behind you and everyone endeavors to be careful it was a pleasure to ride there
5608575 the same bias exists in the east coast gay press according to them stonewall started the gay liberation forgetting that our drag queens rioted years before the gay new years ball where many were arrested started liberation here with the support of clergy and judges when they give a gay trend they mean a new york trend
5608576 the funny part is that we kept on recording the number
5608577 its not trannyshack unless you get hit by bologna or a shoe
5608578 we never thought wed be doing it for this long and it would become internationally renowned and change drag culture
5608579 because it hasnt just changed drag culture in san francisco its changed drag culture worldwide
5608580 nineteen ninety five was a very sad year for me everyone who had influenced me in san francisco died during that year
5608581 i just remember funerals one after another that year i remember what influenced me were the smaller clubs like klubstitute and i thought i could do that it was the punk aesthetic the diy thing for me 1996 when trannyshack started it was when new aids medications were coming out and it felt like a celebration
5608582 every week id take these empty budweiser beer boxes like 50 of them and stack them up and staple fabric around it and that was the stage
5608583 i remember there was a gap between the boxes and one night martiny fell in between the gap it looked like her legs were severed
5608584 it was kind of normal at the time but i remember it being shocking because we couldnt get her out
5608585 you can get away with being bohemian and couch surfing and partying in your 20s in your 30s not so cute in your 40s no one wants to talk to you
5608586 bohemia does not age well if you dont move on
5608587 it started out as a parody of a parody the imperial court coronations which was a parody of miss america
5608588 all you have to do is look at the attendance that night
5608589 i remember getting to the stud and i was running late and there was a huge line down the street the marketing the enthusiasm the anticipation made it a real event also it was only that year we had a performer who was just from another planet what was her name
5608590 plenty yente a nice jewish boy who was studying the flute
5608591 for some people it was a big deal but a cool thing about trannyshack is that everyone is accepted
5608592 even when youre doing conventional drag you dont have to put on traditional makeup or breasts
5608593 it was never my intention to become this drag thing with this institution
5608594 when you are the establishment and you realize that then i think for me i need to quit
5608595 would be like trying to pick out who your step father will be
5608596 someone should not try to fill these heels right away
5608597 it made her want to tear through the dull present
5608598 claw the vivid past back into herself devour it like a bear busting into a campers stores
5608599 i emerged from sukys womb fulsome and alert fat as a six month old and covered in fine black fur
5608600 i can say for certain when the new year will come but i cannot give an exact date for the withdrawal of our troops from the conflict area yet
5608601 i can only say that we will not be leaving as fast as we came
5608602 its not getting any worse but its not getting any better
5608603 its a little sore but i think ive got to keep doing my stuff between starts
5608604 you have to run your other stuff up there this is a playoff race youve got to suck it up
5608605 weve got to find a better way to economize those pitchers at some point
5608606 theyve been banged up real good and theyre starting to run out of games
5608607 maybe i should be worried but worrying is not going to do me any good besides the teams playing hard im not defending our record im just defending the effort i think this teams getting better
5608608 guys came out with a lot more energy this week
5608609 we were focused on getting off the field on third down we didnt do it on the first series but we bounced back nicely with four or five straight three and outs including a defensive score
5608610 it was tough being there for a certain amount of years
5608611 its all business basically and they did what they needed to do
5608612 i just want to go out there and pitch and be reliable be consistent be one of those guys who when they call down i just know that im going to get the ball in an important situation
5608613 when i got to college i pretty much learned not to love one team just have love for the game
5608614 i dont know when but damn sometime soon somethings got to happen and its got to happen soon it cant be like this this is not me im letting my team down basically thats what it is this is not me this is not me and somethings got to happen im the one that has to do it cant say this guy is going to do it for me or this guy is going to do it for me no its going to take a lot and i know that but its got to happen
5608615 anytime you come in and give up hits youre a little bit concerned
5608616 ill have to talk to our people to see if everything is all right if hes healthy
5608617 physically im totally fine im not down on myself i dont think anybody would be happy im not down at all just real off
5608618 its not getting any worse but its not getting any better
5608619 we kind of shot ourselves in the foot in a number of different areas today
5608620 but again if you look at the big picture six out of seven well take that
5608621 guys know if they give good effort and theyre in the right place at the right time it becomes very noticeable
5608622 sometimes it even overshadows what they do from an xs and os standpoint
5608623 i do have a lot of friends on that team its going to be interesting to hit them
5608624 braylon edwards is like my little brother so i communicate with him a lot i have a couple of running backs there i took under my wing so ill have a chance to block them a couple of times on special teams its going to be real exciting to see
5608625 i travel here daily on the trains and it has become a concern that stealing cabling is virtually epidemic
5608626 the reasons this happens is that the metal from this cabling can command a considerable price
5608627 this sort of offence is happening time and again causing disruption and inconvenience and financial losses to many people who travel on trains in addition there is danger caused to the system of the signalling which is interfered with
5608628 when players are hurt you have a chance to work with other guys who normally wouldnt get that much opportunity
5608629 writers critics and the general public react spontaneously to an unusual set of provocative forms with concepts phrases and similes they already know
5608630 a successful iconic building will always elicit a flurry of bizarre comparisons a veritable blizzard of idiotic similes an absolute snowstorm of ridiculous conceit
5608631 the successful landmark has to be both enigmatic and expressive it must suggest much more than it names and leave the final interpretation if it ever comes
5608632 quick before the music stops how ballroom dancing saved my life
5608633 how much do the stars on dancing with the stars get paid
5608634 not often that a government agency so clearly states how it operates
5608635 im going to vote for john mccain i want him to be able to be president before he dies
5608636 am i mistaken or are orgasms not what they used to be
5608637 we dont want to be in a situation where we are in some kind of frozen relationship
5608638 but until russia pulls its forces out of georgia and respects international norms of the 21st century we just cant go on with business as usual
5608639 if these decisions are in fact taken on behalf of the georgian aggressor we will not be able to maintain the quality and the schedule of our relationship with nato
5608640 we have a serious temptation to bring all our potential co operation with nato under question
5608641 we were told to sit him down and talk to him about a few things
5608642 one of the big things was his pitch selection at the plate he walked four times
5608643 when a guy gets sent down after having as much success as hes had up there you kind of wonder what his attitude is going to be we have a good thing going down here were in first place
5608644 hes just got to understand when hustles good and dumb baserunnings bad
5608645 we planned to find a way to ensure a stable electricity supply at a reasonable price
5608646 we have 1 200 people here and we need 400
5608647 wir haben bereits viele verbesserungen an mobileme vorgenommen haben jedoch noch viele weitere vor uns
5608648 people are expecting the worst so its a reason to stay on the sidelines for now
5608649 i dont know if it was because it was monday night or because we had such a long break but for some reason our intensity level was higher its a testament to our leadership and our coaches
5608650 guys came out with a lot more energy this week
5608651 we were focused on getting off the field on third down we didnt do it on the first series but we bounced back nicely with four or five straight three and outs including a defensive score guys made up their mind that enough is enough the defense is making progress
5608652 we have agreed a fee with newcastle for shola and he spent time at the club having a medical
5608653 things are moving on hopefully we can get it all tied up
5608654 since the detroit game getting my feet inbounds is something we have practiced
5608655 it is something i need to do better every day after practice we work on it i even talked to amani and plax about how they get their feet down inbounds
5608656 it was really a great job on both of them of getting his feet down
5608657 hes taken snaps with the first team all training camp hes been making plays for us and his work paid off tonight
5608658 the wedge cleaned them out and gave me a seam to run and everybody else sealed off their blocks out front
5608659 the tough job is the blocking all i had to do is run
5608660 what he did he screwed himself up he got involved with the
5608661 it takes a highly sophisticated agency to produce anthrax in the lethal form not many parties can do that
5608662 continues his part of the war in the form of terrorism it is unlikely that anthrax will remain in letters it is likely that it will be used in the subway of a city or in the ventilation system of a u s building saddam wants revenge against us he wants to do to the u s what weve done to iraq
5608663 the south african media have been abuzz with details of that nations former biological warfare program and its links to the cia the south african bio chemical war program was code named project coast and was centered at the roodeplat research laboratories north of pretoria the lab maintained links to the us biowarfare facility at fort detrick and britains porton down laboratory the head of the south african program dr wouter basson was reportedly offered a job with the cia in the united states after the fall of the apartheid regime according to former south african national intelligence agency deputy director michael kennedy when basson refused the offer the cia allegedly threatened to kill him
5608664 they were drinking buddies whod both been involved in anti terrorism efforts long before the world trade center crumbled now suddenly people were saying that hatfill could be responsible for the countrys first case of domestic bioterrorism a release of lethal anthrax through the mail that had left five people dead and 17 others infected in the fall of 2001
5608665 where hed begun making a name for himself preaching the dangers of a bioterror attack soon they ran into each other again at charleys place in mclean then a favorite hangout for the u s intelligence community
5608666 showed up there with men whom bedlington recognized as bodyguards for saudi arabian prince bandar bin sultan
5608667 former cnn reporter who has known hatfill socially for six years said he and hatfill are part of a group of friends who visited a house in the virginia mountains near shenandoah national park in october for a weekend of skeet shooting and socializing
5608668 inspired a mini industry of speculation that he may somehow be implicated in last falls deadly anthrax attacks
5608669 the hunting of steven j hatfill why are so many people
5608670 symington is strongly believed to have worked with the ian smith led white supremacist regime on its biological warfare project
5608671 the zimbabwe authorities have since established that smiths security forces particularly the much feared selous scouts stealthily distributed the deadly anthrax spore among the hungry cattle of the rhodesian tribal trust lands where most africans lived and seeded cholera into the rivers
5608672 it is true that anthrax was used in an experimental role and the idea came from the army psychological operations
5608673 the phd certificate he submitted to nih could have easily been tracked back by authorities and exposed as a forgery
5608674 but it was overlooked and hatfills credentials helped him gain access to sensitive government agencies
5608675 on october 4 2001 we confirmed the first bio terrorism related anthrax case identified in the united states is a resident of palm beach county florida
5608676 identified themselves as pilots when they came to the emergency room of holy cross hospital in fort lauderdale fla last june one had an ugly dark lesion on his leg
5608677 in october a pharmacist in delray beach fla said he had told the f b i that two of the hijackers mohamad atta and marwan al shehhi came into the pharmacy looking for something to treat irritations on mr attas hands
5608678 after sept 11 when federal investigators found the medicine among the possessions of one of the hijackers ahmed alhaznawi dr tsonas reviewed the case and arrived at a new diagnosis
5608679 the fbi contends that it pursued a hijacker connection in the early days and became convinced that they were not involved in these mailings mainly because the anthrax strain used was a military research strain many people in florida however who know about the hijackers movements in that part of the country in the months before 9 11 do not believe the fbi pursued this with enough vigor
5608680 in an interview dr otoole said that after consulting with additional medical experts on the alhaznawi case she was more persuaded than ever that the diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax was correct
5608681 they would probably have needed an accomplice to mail the tainted letters
5608682 could embarrass the u s government and provide insight into the ongoing investigation of the fall 2001 bioterrorism attacks

5608687 zimbabwean authorities have made several reports that indicate that rhodesians were using biological warfare against guerillas during the liberation war but these have not received international coverage
5608688 they would relentlessly track down their opponents and kill them even if it meant crossing into neighboring countries in violation of international law their training taught them to live off the barren land during their long pursuit on foot drinking fetid water and eating carrion scraps some articles claim that they were responsible for two out of every three enemy fatalities in the civil war admirers and vets boast that the selous scouts were the most skilled and ruthless guerrilla warfare fighters in history
5608689 bioterrorism related anthrax first case of bioterrorism related inhalational anthrax in the united states palm beach county florida 2001
5608690 i was surprised to see that spitzer had used his position as attorney general to support one private litigant over another normally this is not done silverstein could well have been someone who destroyed evidence concerning the 9 11 events by apparently ordering or consenting to the tearing pulling down of 7 wtc and the removal of the debris from his multiple ground leased premises thereafter
5608691 maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse
5608692 i read that the white house did know and they went on the anti biotics
5608693 african american employees at brentwood us postal facility were basically left out there to twist in the wind when the white guys up on capitol hill got immediate treatment
5608694 while its vaccine worked well against the vollum strain of anthrax used by russia it was more problematic against the ames strain so it had conducted tests with the virulent ames strain on guinea pigs mice and monkeys with mixed results bioports spokesperson confirmed that it had access to the virulent ames strain for testing on animals

5608700 im doing what ive always been trained and taught to do if you know its right you stand up for it and likewise if you know its wrong you have to challenge it no matter what the consequences
5608701 after 13 years of exemplary service to my country i am willing to give up my job my rank and everything i have worked for to avoid taking an unsafe drug
5608702 it is appalling that admiral crowe who was a key player in the effort to let all u s citizens sleep better at night by leading our defenders of freedom to defeat communism now keeps these same defenders and their families awake at night wondering if their health will be defeated by his companys product
5608703 vaccine a the covert government experiment thats killing our soldiers
5608704 only one paper at the workshop reported near perfect results 100 percent protection from the ames strain with just one or two shots
5608705 why would active duty reserve and national guard personnel jeopardize their military careers and even their liberty rather than take the vaccine the missing element of the mandatory anthrax vaccine program is trust radiation testing agent orange the reckless use of experimental drugs and mysterious gulf war illness have made military men and women understandably distrustful of the pentagon on medical matters

5608713 the rape of the public resources of great britain was virtually complete
5608714 interests of the saudis and the carlyle group began to look to the united states for more promising plunder
5608715 governor engler gave the most respectable and profitable agency in michigan government to fuad el hibri without any individual investment whatsoever
5608716 incurred no individual expense made no investments and did not owe any individual promissory notes or obligations of any kind for their new lab purchase
5608717 this group is obviously an investment syndicate composed of numerous intelligence agency members representing assorted countries
5608718 the development and use of biological agents against economic targets such as crops livestock and ecosystems
5608719 such warfare can always be carried out under the pretexts that such traumatic occurrences are the result of natural circumstances that lead to outbreaks of diseases and disasters of either endemic or epidemic proportions
5608720 when a travel brochure mailed from miami to a buenos aires family initially tested positive
5608721 within hours frantic citizens swamped police stations hospitals and all kinds of government offices throughout the country with about 1 000 pieces of suspicious mail most of them posted from the united states or pakistan
5608722 the danger of anthrax spores spreading through the air and the requirements for decontamination after various kinds of attacks the author william c patrick iii describes placing 2 5 grams of bacillus globigii an anthrax simulant in a standard business envelope slightly more than the estimated amount of anthrax in each of the letters that killed five people last fall
5608723 is a friend and proteg of patrick 75 a bio weapons legend who has himself experienced the dual status of expert and possible suspect
5608724 hatfill commissioned william patrick iii a biological weapons expert to write a report on how to deal with anthrax sent through the mail
5608725 the concept of a report on anthrax mail attacks two years before last octobers mailings intrigued the fbi in particular patricks report discussed mailing 2 5 grams of anthrax powder about the same amount contained in the deadly anthrax letters
5608726 it was just shock and complete disbelief that this was happening
5608727 before the sept 11 attacks ivins had worked on and held a share of two anthrax vaccine patents at least one of which was licensed to
5608728 in the letter to rumsfeld daschle raised concerns that the vaccine didnt work and may have made soldiers sick he noted that the u s food and drug administration approves drugs only after they are proven safe and effective
5608729 the letter also signed by then house minority leader richard gephardt was sent to rumsfeld on june 21 2001 the first anthrax letters were postmarked sept 18 2001 the anthrax laced letters sent to the offices of daschle and vermont sen patrick leahy were postmarked oct 9 2001
5608730 he has criticized the fbi investigation of the anthrax letters and the agencys refusal to update him and other victims on their progress
5608731 blumenthal said tuesday that attorneys in his office worked closely with dodd and daschle to craft the letter to rumsfeld
5608732 scientist theorized anthrax mail attack fbi searched apartment of expert linked to study
5608733 you simply dont develop a new hyper weaponized strain of anthrax powder for military defense and then commission the top u s anthrax expert to report on this new weapons capability and lethality from mailed delivery unless thats how you foresee it being used
5608734 the possibility that financial gain was the motive behind the anthrax mailings
5608735 a contradictory announcement was relayed the same day december 21 2001 by ohio senator mike dewine based on an abc news report concerning a bmi employee who had been under fbi investigation for an anthrax threat fbi director robert mueller had according to
5608736 last week i phoned the fbi why i asked when the evidence was so abundant did the trail appear to have gone cold the investigation is continuing the spokesman replied has it gone cold because it has led you to a government office i asked he put down the phone
5608737 the armys development of weaponized anthrax the processed ames strain for example directly contravenes both the biological weapons convention and domestic law so does its plan to test live microbes in aerosol chambers at the edgewood chemical biological center also in maryland so does its development of a genetically modified fungus for attacking coca crops in colombia and gm bacteria for destroying materials belonging to enemy forces these as the research group project sunshine has discovered appear to be just a tiny sample of the illegal offensive biological research programmes which the us government has secretly funded
5608738 this appears to be the case and explains the fbis capricious explanations to the press
5608739 in 1957 at the dugway proving grounds in utah the q fever toxin was discharged by an airborne f 100a plane
5608740 riddle of the spores why has the fbi investigation into the anthrax attacks stalled
5608741 public health expert says solving the anthrax mailing mystery may be easy fbi doesnt seem interested
5608742 ivins performed research that required exposing research animals to airborne anthrax according to a 1998 report in the journal vaccine the goal was to test whether a new vaccine could guard against anthrax inhaled in a bioterrorist attack
5608743 in ivins vaccine experiments was a wet form sprayed into the faces of macaque monkeys through a mask
5608744 q did ivins and other researchers for the u s army medical research institute of infectious diseases at fort detrick md work with dried anthrax spores
5608745 a no says col david franz the institutes commander until 1998 and now with the midwest research institute
5608746 q would ivins have had the opportunity to make dried anthrax
5608747 q did the lab have equipment to produce dried anthrax
5608748 a no franz says adding that it would be difficult for ivins or others to carry out the work without detection

5608751 cipro and smallpox vaccine have much in common besides capturing americas urgent attention

5608943 your story left me curious why would disney require cast members to transcribe guest complaints rather than have the guests themselves fill out a form i asked a family member who is a lawyer this is what they said
5608944 it could have something to do with avoiding evidence that demonstrates actual knowledge of problems at the park for liability purposes when a third party fills out the form employee then it is easier to be vague about descriptions another possibility is that guests tend to ramble on about irrelevant garbage and the cast member can get right to the point of what information is needed by the management thereby saving time and money
5608945 the western mindanao command will continue military actions to catch and neutralize those who are responsible for the violence in lanao del norte
5608946 troops from the western mindanao command have cleared kolambugan town in lanao del norte of moro islamic liberation front as the military continue to pursue the fleeing bandits taking with them innocent civilians the rebels used as human shields
5608947 we will have to await the ruling of the supreme court the president has made it very clearly that she is looking at all option possible to bring peace in mindanao
5608948 the unauthorized milf attack is jeopardizing the peace talks creating havoc and atrocities so how can we say that there will be peace in mindanao
5608949 it would appear as if they milf rebels are threatening government to fast track the signing of the ancestral domain agreement but that has to go still to our processes we have the supreme court process it will go to congress we will have to call for a plebiscite and they will have to be patient if they are unleashing their dogs of war then they are entirely wrong because they are jeopardizing the peace talks
5608950 we are assessing all of these events now how the milf operates as an organization and how their troops operate whether they are under their control or not and ultimately how the milf will take care of its own internal organization we will also determine how we will ultimately deal with this whole issue of negotiations with them
5608951 i compared these rebel attacks to a shattered glass and it is going to be very difficult to put them back together small pieces of shattered glass are very difficult to put back together but despite of that difficulty it is very important to bring back that small pieces of shattered glass together because peace is the only option we have
5608952 there is totally no justification for armed groups without warning in a traitorous manner attacked unprotected civilians in many areas in lanao del norte and some other areas there is no justification at all that armed groups invade areas destroying communities commit murder and violate the law whether they are uncontrolled people by the milf
5608953 with all these incidents how can we say that everything is normal or that everything is business as usual we are monitoring all of these because there are so many incidents already are people playing games with government government is very sincere in the effort to bring sustainable peace to mindanao
5608954 all we want to see is that no armed group such as the group of commander bravo be allowed to go unpunished and that is the exact statement of the president
5608955 we need to have peace in mindanao and all of these events now are glitches already on the radar screen but we have to work towards sustainable peace as what the president has always clearly stated the alternative to peace is war and war is unimaginable scenario in mindanao
5608956 we have filed a formal protest with the cease fire committees against the milf for these attacks
5608957 this is plain and simple violations of the law and we cannot put any justification as to their actions like they can be frustrated with the issuance of the tro supreme courts temporary restraining order on the signing of the ancestral domain deal between manila and the milf this is not sufficient reasons or justification to commit an illegal act
5608958 we have been saying this repeatedly even right at the beginning of the peace process that there are sectors in the milf both political and military which are against in negotiating peace with the government because their argument is the government is not sincere in finding just and lasting solution to the problems of mindanao
5608959 milf members are so frustrated with whats going on they believed that the government is insincere
5608960 some members and other groups are disgruntled with the peace process and they can mount future attacks even without telling the milf leadership otherwise we will stop them
5608961 as far as the milf is concerned the ancestral domain agreement is a done deal we will not agree to renegotiate the moa ad

5608988 deandre and glover quin theyre probably the top two cornerbacks in our conference right now
5608989 i know its made me a whole lot better because every time you go against them you have to bring your a game or theyre going to make you look like a little kid
5608990 when we came down to albuquerque we saw it as a war with the north
5608991 last year i went up against one of my former teammates alex bernard
5608992 i got my first start up there against him it was pretty special
5608993 ive had to run my routes a little tighter and faster
5608994 because with deandre one inch could mean the difference between being covered and open
5608995 i think ive been coming out on top a little more lately
5608996 i already knew when i first got here being a walk on even players who come in on scholarship have to spend at least their first year on scout team
5608997 its always good to come in with the faith that youre going to get a chance to play
5608998 but for the most part im sure everybody who has been on scout team goes through a time where they say man i might not ever get a chance to play
5608999 there was no way i was going to allow myself to go through everything i went through only to let myself quit
5609000 at the same time i can look back and say i made it through
5609001 ive managed to train myself to accept it take it in understand what theyre really trying to say look past the screaming and take the positive out of it
5609002 with mike the sky is the limit when hes feeling healthy
5609003 i have the utmost respect for mike and confidence in mike and every year he just gets better
5609004 i felt it was my duty to rutgers university to come back
5609005 i think its just things that we need to get accomplished and thats something that i want to be a part of
5609006 i turned 19 like a month and a couple days ago im definitely thinking im quite young
5609007 its given me that extra boost of confidence like i already know what im getting into i feel confident going against 22 year olds that are 320 pounds i dont care
5609008 when younger d linemen ask me questions im definitely there to help them in any way i can
5609009 im all about getting the unit better you might want to swim here you might want to club there whatever works
5609010 when youre young you sort of question yourself before you question somebody else like you wonder whats my responsibility
5609011 they know they can ask now its just about them having confidence to ask questions and the whole units gotten better even when i mess up i can ask rulon or tyson alualu what i can do better
5609012 what can really top your first home game coming back to arizona coming back and scoring a touchdown
5609013 i wanted to get some things accomplished tonight and hopefully get out of it without any injuries
5609014 and i think weve done that or at least theres nothing im aware of right now that is a significant injury
5609015 i think weve got a lot done in camp this kind of concludes camp
5609016 well stand down here for a couple days and get school started and then well restart practice tuesday and focus on marshall university
5609017 i wanted the kids to have some fun and play you know with family and friends out here and the new kids
5609018 we just wanted to play and get some things done on both sides of the ball
5609019 theyre a little bit different style guys i feel very blessed they might be the best set of four since ive been here
5609020 i made one bad throw down here in the red zone there were a couple balls i overthrew that were easy touchdowns and i think i make those plays nine out of 10 times in practice
5609021 weve got two weeks til marshall its not like were playing them tomorrow
5609022 as a whole i felt i played alright i still gotta improve i didnt do everything perfect but neither did anybody on the football field we still got a lot of improving to do but i was pretty pleased with tonights performance
5609023 to me he looks very comfortable in the huddle he looks very comfortable under center
5609024 hes not flawless he threw a pick he did a couple of things on film im sure well all grimace about but ive never had a quarterback that didnt ive never had one play perfect yet im really pleased with him and i thought drew kiel started to emerge as well

5609030 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5609031 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5609032 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5609033 note from merkel to rice you and your white house say good bye to georgia and lika and iran and u s and russia and all else would be fine
5609034 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5609035 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5609036 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5609037 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5609038 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5609039 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5609040 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5609041 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5609042 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5609043 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5609044 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5609045 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5609046 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5609047 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5609048 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5609049 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5609050 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5609051 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5609052 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5609053 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5609054 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5609055 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5609056 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5609057 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5609058 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5609059 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5609060 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5609061 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5609062 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5609063 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5609064 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5609065 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5609066 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5609067 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5609068 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5609069 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5609070 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5609071 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5609072 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5609073 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5609074 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5609075 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5609076 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5609077 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5609078 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5609079 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5609080 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5609081 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5609082 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5609083 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5609084 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5609085 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5609086 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5609087 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5609088 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5609089 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5609090 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5609091 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5609092 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5609093 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5609094 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5609095 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5609096 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5609097 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5609098 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5609099 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5609341 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5609342 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5609367 he was quiet calm collected a real thinker and not a risk taker
5609368 today were doing a more intense search than sunday turning over every inch
5609369 he has the skills and ability to take care of himself out there
5609370 hes heavily involved in the community both he and his wife
5609371 as far as edwin getting lost in the area its hard to believe
5609372 he knew his land so well knew every tree on his property unless something overtook him physically or mentally he wouldnt be lost
5609373 if something happens how do we get her files in a hurry
5609374 nova scotians shouldnt be paying in the vicinity of 175 200 to access their medical files
5609375 costs for records transferred are the responsibility of the patient who may opt to have either a summary or the complete record
5609376 handled by an outside or contracted information provider manager but there must be a legal contract that specifies the physician has full control of the information

5609381 the smell was so strong that i thought somebody must have been smoking in the car
5609382 at first i thought it could have still been the previous passengers although that would have been illegal too
5609383 i didnt really look at the roof number because i was kind of shocked
5609384 you have a responsibility to report it thats why i ended up calling the police about this
5609385 i was home safe so it wasnt about me it was just about other people getting in with him
5609386 i was told theyre self employed theres nothing we can do
5609387 i leave a message in the evening but in the morning the drivers going to be sober and off the road
5609388 a woman said they couldnt do anything if i didnt have the roof number or the licence plate which i was really upset at myself about i felt kind of guilty for not knowing it
5609389 as soon as i mentioned the smell and all that stuff he got really really defensive and started almost yelling at me and saying that it was probably the passengers that were high as a kite
5609390 unfortunately i will say our dispatcher handled this the wrong way in our opinion at this stage
5609391 i call the driver in check the driver out check the car out
5609392 if i thought the driver was indeed high on drugs he would no longer be employed here
5609393 i would have perceived it as an impaired driving complaint
5609394 there would actually be nothing we could do about it at this point because it was two days ago
5609395 to charge someone with impaired driving you need to have them within two hours
5609396 he really is the leader of show jumping in canada
5609397 he comes down to the maritime fall fair every year hes an absolutely outstanding person

5609399 but for the other three riders as well theyve worked so hard and eric lamaze has had such an awful time and for him to be redeemed in the last couple of years and to get this medal is incredible
5609400 as he says himself that was the lowest point of his life
5609401 four to six years ago really was the lowest point of his life and for him to come back now and first of all be selected for this team and actually win the medal is just phenomenal
5609402 for so long the canadians have been in the back seat
5609403 they had not great horses theyve come 30th and 40th at the olympics and to go from that to now winning a medal just shows how far theyve come and ian really is the leader in all of this just about everybody thats come up through the international ranks has schooled with him at some point
5609404 im sure that hes a mentor to many of the up and comers it was jill henselwoods first olympic experience and im sure that he mentored her all the way

5609438 if you need to be in toronto waiting for a double lung transplant then maybe you should focus in on that im not suggesting that they should sell houses or anything but normally its a pretty equal cost

5609445 a modern and inclusive party that steers away from race politics
5609446 unavoidable decision that the time had come to lay the ghost of the party to rest
5609447 we are trying to restore that balance to have a real strong opposition for the anc
5609448 we were cat food we were not that special at that time no armour just meat on feet
5609449 it was in size between a lion and a leopard it probably ambushed its prey used its front paws to subdue the animal while biting into its throat
5609450 we dont know what happened then but i like to believe it was probably a woman who first dragged fire into the cave
5609451 i think it would have been a woman because she is likely to have done it for the safety of the group and her children the men i think would have been more interested in hunting
5609452 julia research suggests dino felis preyed largely on ancestral springbok
5609453 how many people getting shot or killed is it going to take
5609454 if other people can shut them down why cant we
5609455 when these guys are robbing these places are they carrying out big bags of stuffed rabbits
5609456 of course not theyve got cash they have to know theyre paying out
5609457 everyone else around is at risk when theres a robber
5609458 its in our neighborhood in a lot of towns thats not the case here theyre amid our homes
5609459 there are some people that are pretty doggone tired of that and i think they have a reason to be
5609460 i tell them as soon as you come in im going to bust you
5609461 we dont want it to happen again and disrupt service
5609462 dengan begitu kita berharap juga pakistan dapat memulihkan diri memulihkan keadaan
5609463 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report

5609466 once in a lifetime opportunity to provide ubiquitous wireless broadband access to all americans
5609467 open access to this unused bandwidth would surely be good for our own bottom line not to mention those of many of our industry peers better access to the internet means more people doing web searches and using our software products
5609468 she was paralysed in her hind legs and we had to equip her with a metallic cart with two wheels in order for her to be able to move
5609469 her head started wobbling and she yelled that she needed to see the band because they were friends of rod when it didnt work she stropped off and told staff to get her a car back to london immediately she was told it would take five minutes so she went nuts again she spotted a car that was waiting and opened the door despite being told it was already booked and luggage was loaded
5609470 fuckin men they text 20 times a day then cancel our dinner plans
5609471 i can count on one hand the number of people here with any kind of crop this year
5609472 but growers are the ultimate optimists hopefully well have a good crop next year
5609473 i dont care if youre making spark plugs or olives you need a constant flow into the market
5609474 we cant build a market and then say we dont have any olives this year
5609475 compared to the last two years this is a pleasant change of pace
5609476 this would be considered an average to slightly above average crop and a night and day difference from the last two years
5609477 but this is not the end for there are higher powers of consciousness beyond mind which await their turn and must have their act in the greater play their part of the creative lila
5609478 satya hi shiva hai shiva hi sundra sundra yeh sansar hai

5609480 truth is lord shiva and lord shiva the god who is omnipresent is truth
5609481 lie is a sentence made from set of some true words with wrong intentions which actually do not meet the requirements of time
5609482 a true word is a word which has a potential to be proven as a truth

5609486 inderdaad onze monteurs hebben het erg druk en er valt helaas niet een bepaald uur af te spreken hij komt zeker tussen 12 00 en 18 00 uur
5609487 nou nee tegenslag met een leidinkje leggen gehad u kent dat wel
5609488 nou meneer de monteur ik ben druk met het eten bezig en u kunt hier zeker niet voor halfzeven zijn en we hebben gezien wat er hiervoor gepasseerd is inmiddels geen vertrouwen meer in de zaak dus we zien alsnog van goedkoper surfen en bellen af
5609489 och kom nou toch meneer ik moet ook nog eten en dat wordt helemaal een latertje
5609490 nee sorry meneer de monteur we sturen de twee volgens voorschrift retour en mijn vrouw en ik hebben zojuist besloten dat we op termijn naar een klantvriendelijker provider gaan

5609492 the collection will meet and exceed all standards and expectations of the vancouver customer

5609494 we think this years high earnings growth will not be sustainable into next year
5609495 next year the banks may face higher credit costs and that may lower earnings growth
5609496 the positive earnings revision cycle over the past 12 months looks to be ending as nims credit risks are rising as chinas economy faces potentially greater than expected slowdown risks
5609497 the odd bit of profit taking maybe but i think the stakes theyve got are quite unique and they wouldnt be in a rush to sell unless they were really financially stretched
5609498 that the sound judgment he has demonstrated on foreign policy issues like iraq and pakistan more than compensates for any such shortcomings
5609499 at a time when our foreign policy and national security have so obviously suffered from a simplistic black and white interpretation
5609500 an american president who spent part of his formative years and young adulthood living in a poor country under a dictatorship brings an understanding of the complexity of things that others may not have im not saying that official travels and congressional delegations are without value but there are limits to what you can glean from that

5609521 i was involved for almost 30 years in the appointment of judges and i dont know of one name that i knew personally who became a judge that was a bad apple
5609522 we have a system that works in my judgment replacing it will perhaps not be that good
5609523 so that they would not be in the firm any more
5609524 harper needs all the help he can get in quebec a place where mulroney continues to command a network of political leaders and operatives and where he remains much beloved
5609525 should mulroney decide to intervene in the next election campaign against harper the prime ministers efforts to win a majority may be thwarted
5609526 in the end mr harper will be the worse for it this was one of the rare occasions where mr harper panicked to his detriment
5609527 wise enough to be tough on his opponents when it is to his advantage but he must display a more amiable side to his party the press and the nation being optimistic and visionary rather than gruff and a loner is the better path to becoming a majority prime minister
5609528 i dont think there is nearly enough pro toronto urban credibility that the stephen harper government has established for there to be a swing in that tradition
5609529 does not have a city agenda does not have a toronto agenda and has a finance minister who says we are just whine a lot
5609530 there is a lot of good stuff this government has done for toronto

5609533 you want me to the tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of sask you have to put things in perspective
5609534 we are at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china ask any businessman who has been to china and he will tell you the same thing
5609535 we did not pass as the newest little dog of the united states
5609536 of course tibet is a problem but tibet has been a province for them for a long long time to make the dalai lama an honorary citizen of canada was not a compliment to china
5609537 but for them the dalai lama is not a religious leader
5609538 i have to tell you that when you say resistant to change you should have been with me in 1994 when i visited china go to china today and youll see there has been a hell of a lot of change they have improved

5609565 brown has had probably two or three ongoing problems over a period of about three weeks one is a leg from a knock one is a hip from a knock both of them were collision injuries so hes had a couple of things that have been niggling away
5609566 i thought our guys were really quite switched on in their roles defensively i thought our backs were really sound they were prepared to come off their men and assist at times and we quite regularly saw two on ones three on one scenarios happening where backmen went to franklin and were able to do the job those who played on roughy were really quite solid on him as well
5609567 four quarter wise that was the thing that we were more pleased about that from start to finish we sort of got the job done the way we wanted to
5609568 i was really surprised i must say when i picked up the papers and saw id taken aim at them i didnt think it was that at all
5609569 nigels always had a great empathy for his teammates and he knows the game hes got a great empathy for the game

5609572 theres a lot of options in different places where myself and my family can go weve just got to try and work out which ones the best one for us
5609573 its hard not to live in the moment and for me at the moment i havent been able to get what i want out of footy
5609574 so at the moment im sort of frustrated by what has happened this year
5609575 but my career as a whole has been really successful
5609576 i was waking up and not really looking forward to playing footy as i had in previous years and you just get the feeling it is time

5609578 it does go really quickly but id like to be here right to the end

5609594 i hope the world has woken up to what is going on the russians should get out of my country
5609595 the worst thing the world could do would be to compromise and show weakness
5609596 the russians will invent all kinds of excuses pretexts not to pull back their troops
5609597 they will rename themselves peacekeepers maintain their positions in the security zone

5609599 since then there has been a clash going on between nato and the taliban six taliban were killed after they blew up the bombs they had on their bodies two children have been killed and two more along with a woman have been wounded
5609600 we had up to six suicide bombers on foot some of the bombers were able to blow themselves up outside the base and some have been killed by our forces
5609601 the firefight is still ongoing there are no casualties on our own side
5609602 this is not a game this is training for war
5609603 the game is played on a board of 128 squares obtained by adding to all four sides of a regular eight by eight board a strip of two by eight or eight by two squares players have each twenty four pieces a headquarter a bomber a tank two guns two cavalry two machine guns and fifteen soldiers

5609607 the final word then is the game read how and why the system is as it is follow the parameters and then cut portions as needed to maintain excitement
5609608 thanks to john wayne and lee marvin it was relatively easy for gamers to translate the action of the game board into real battles in their imaginations lending the whole experience a lively escapist quality

5609634 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5609635 it can be an attribute because i have long arms
5609636 but im working on my strength those throws are going to get better from here
5609637 i have the levers maybe some day ill be the first recordholder who is clean
5609638 when youre not in first you pay attention a little bit sooner than you would
5609639 weve already started weve got to take care of what were doing but were interested
5609640 when you look at it theres time but at the same time you dont want to get behind
5609641 at this time of the year if you get five or six games behind especially seven its not like you cant do it but odds are youve got to really play good and the team ahead of you kind of has to fold kind of has to go through a bad streak the thing about it right now id say at 38 games a team that can get a winning streak going or can get hot thats a team that can put a good push on claiming our division weve got to stay with them
5609642 you should let it affect you psychologically in a good way like last year
5609643 having to watch the mets last year we responded and played well hopefully at this point two games behind well do the same we watch what they do they keep on winning we know we have to keep on winning its unfortunate that we put ourselves in this position but thats the position we are in so were forced to see what they do
5609644 at this time of the year when you let it slip behind its harder to gain ground so this time of year yeah you pay more attention when you are behind
5609645 said liukin who on different days competed in the qualifiers the team competition the all around which she won and the floor exercise before yesterdays bars contest
5609646 i dont think a lot of people know whats going on right now
5609647 i believe its correct to have two gold medals three
5609648 im very disappointed in that consistently it was the same country i think this was a different judge i dont want to go any further with that want to go ask her no idea theres not a single gymnast in finals from there
5609649 i know they were both from australia i dont want to start anything im just kind of stating the facts
5609650 if it had happened in the all around i would have been more disappointed
5609651 the chinese girl did an excellent routine and the girl who got third i thought got a little underscored its unfair to her
5609652 im hoping to get that gold i feel i missed out on today
5609653 iguodala is a major and integral part of our team
5609654 he is not replaceable the way the league works and the collective bargaining agreement works this man was not replaceable iguodalas option was to play for the qualifying offer and then become an unrestricted free agent
5609655 we didnt want to even get to that we wanted to make a deal so that wed have him for the long term
5609656 we made a commitment to the city and to our fans that we were going for an nba championship when we signed elton brand
5609657 this to me was a deal that we had to get done along with reserve guard lou williams who signed a 5 year deal worth about 25 million
5609658 now we have a nucleus of players that we feel real good about we wanted iguodala in a 76er uniform we were going to make a deal with him and thats what we did
5609659 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year
5609660 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5609661 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5609662 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5609663 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5609664 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5609665 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5609666 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5609667 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5609668 if serbia gets that far well be ready for them
5609669 its hard to execute because you need to be fortunate opportunities have to arise and we were fortunate this off season
5609670 basketball people in the nba have a high regard for andre iguodala because of all his attributes
5609671 a lot of people were saying gosh you turned down a lot of money last year but we looked at it as a challenge
5609672 together we had the belief in what he can do as a player it obviously worked out for him
5609673 i want to improve as a player in this city
5609674 andre had one guy guarding him and another four guys waiting on him
5609675 its extremely difficult to do something with that and thats why we made it a major goal of ours to go out and get that other piece to help us to help andre we did it when we got an elton brand type
5609676 sensitive sexual amp beautiful girl is waiting for u ill give u all i have all of me just for u

5609680 it was a good book i blame it on the book
5609681 i just didnt get up and walk around like im supposed to my back just kind of froze up on me a little bit
5609682 talk to him there he is right now in all his splendor
5609683 my hands slipped a couple times and i guess they saw me
5609684 and they didnt see that one i had a big target on my back
5609685 we need to find a spot for this guy somewhere
5609686 thats about it just from playing last year you understand that brians going to play at running back and theres not really much room for a lot of other guys to play you just know that you just want to play football you want to get in the game so any time theyre telling you they want to put you on the football field thats a good thing
5609687 im not going to say i expected it but i was ready for it
5609688 he has to be able to block or at least sustain a block where hes not getting pushed back and then understand his leverage of that
5609689 then he has to be effective in the pass game and be able to catch the football and the handful of times that we give him the ball during the season he has to be productive with those we ask our fullback to be a good special teams player or at least a contributor so that ends up being the main part
5609690 the thing he has improved at most is we knew he could run the football but hes a special teams player he deserves an opportunity hes a big kid who wants to be on the field and he doesnt really care where he plays he just wants to play so well give him a shot
5609691 i think its something that hes going to have to work hard to be able to do in such a quick time
5609692 tony is an athletic guy hes also a big guy so definitely can take a pounding and he can do it its just being able to do it in a week and be really good at it its probably going to be tough youll be able to see what he can do when he gets in there on friday
5609693 maybe it would have been better earlier but thats not what it is they did it now studying the position isnt really the thing playing running back you know the fullback position most things are the same you just know it because youre in the same meeting room its not really much of a change pass plays youre still doing the same thing on every pass play the only thing that changes is the run blocking and its not that hard the guys going to come to you its more about just wanting to do it
5609694 surprise me no i kind of came in here expecting a lot of curveballs and twists and turns
5609695 for me now its a four man race instead of three
5609696 then she decided to get fit and change her speed
5609697 she needed that quick burst of speed every time both early in the game and late in the game she completely changed her fitness level
5609698 she has been one of the most important players on this team
5609699 i see it as a collective effort what weve been able to take from abbys injury is that it isnt just one person
5609700 if brazil is going to focus on me its not going to matter
5609701 it was great playing with them but lets face it
5609702 we knew coming into spring training he would make the rotation
5609703 we slipped him right into the three hole and hes done a great job we watch his pitch counts and try to rest him but his stuff is as good now as it was early in the year it shows how hard hes worked
5609704 its a form of reverse evolution rendering the numbers of the best players with the best karma obsolete
5609705 this is the number of craig biggio for two decades he gave more effort and got more out of his ability than anybody in his generation honor his memory
5609706 the u s a hasnt really had a great showing so far and we wanted to uplift the track team with the sweep
5609707 i knew america was struggling a bit but i knew we could be the heart of the team that could bring it back
5609708 right now the way were playing we get him out of there in the seventh or eighth inning he has had a couple of key hits for us hes not swinging the bat the way we think he can swing it but i think he has helped everybody out to relax a little bit at the plate and get better
5609709 hes going to get some practice time in there this week
5609710 he played very good football this past week not only from the backfield carrying the football but he was taking special teams very seriously
5609711 just from playing last year you understand brian is going to play and there is not much room for a lot of other guys to play you know you want to get onto the field any time they want to put you on the field its a good thing
5609712 hes a big guy so he can definitely take a pounding
5609713 just being able to do it in a week and be really good at it its probably going to be tough
5609714 but that is not what it is they did it now studying the position isnt really the thing playing running back you know the fullback position
5609715 i know its a challenge for him to learn a new position with blocking schemes and stuff
5609716 its going to be something to sit back and watch hopefully hell do well with it
5609717 im going to have to put more time into it as far as the position change goes its not one of the easiest but fullback and tailback go hand in hand
5609718 pass blocking is the same its not like i have to learn too much more for the most part you know a lot of the fullback responsibility from being a running back i would say its just the run blocking
5609719 hes a great kid he wants to be on the field he doesnt care where he plays he wants to play well give him a shot
5609720 it was unfortunate laporta had to go down because of things that went on earlier
5609721 if the ball wasnt cut off it would have been a bang bang play and nobody would have said anything
5609722 we do not teach that in china or in the united states
5609723 it was a low blow to throw at his head
5609724 i think it was brutal to throw at his head you can hit guys in other places thats part of the game
5609725 thats baseball but you never hit the guy in the chest thats an illegal slide the umpire should have ejected him thats where the game got out of hand
5609726 the last one laportas beaning really bothered me i hope the fans dont get the wrong impression of the game
5609727 if a referee is going to make a judgment ok but it doesnt make any sense that everyone would come over spend all that time looking at a tape that provides incontrovertible visual evidence that a butt caused the damage and then the decision is to allow the referees first incorrect ruling to stand
5609728 the first concern should always be to get the call right
5609729 a saga of bad or poor judgment dereliction of duty total lack of governance greed breach of rules and law gross negligence and possibly criminal acts cascading down from the very top of aibas former administration
5609730 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields

5609737 time will tell but hes not a guy you write off
5609738 he might be the best olympic athlete of all time
5609739 incredible you talk about tiger woods michael phelps and michael jordan hes part of that class where they dominate the sport
5609740 fine when you go we wont transfer you well put you in as you quit and if the other branch calls for a reference ill give you a bad review and tell them you never came in on time and called out all the time
5609741 my son will stay up all night basically playing xbox live with friends that are in various parts of the world
5609742 and yet i cant sit there in front of the tv and have the same kind of a social interaction around my favorite basketball game or golf match
5609743 i was like damn because i knew what was coming after that especially with what had been going on with him not running out a play
5609744 they scrutinize the small things here the way i look at it just play hard just play well all that is forgotten about if he performs well theyll forget about it
5609745 as of late its been all love youve got to understand the city hasnt had a championship in a while and the fans are very passionate about their sports ive learned there are things you just cant say even if the statement is right you can kind of get caught up in tough situations at times
5609746 there have been a number of times in his career where hes bet on himself on his confidence in what he can do
5609747 i dont like to talk about myself but i think ive done enough to earn where im at and that i have so much room to grow
5609748 im working on whats after this contract to continue to be a great player in this league i dont think you have to be a great shooter to be effective but you have to be a good shooter i work out every day trying to become a better shooter just like anybody else
5609749 if i improve every year i think ill be a shoo in if im also a winner the olympic team has guys who play well together they have some guys who have gone deep in the playoffs who have won a championship
5609750 i dont like iggy i dont mind the other a
5609751 it just shows the fans are watching basketball and know what i do i want to be dre thats it

5609757 four years after athens his main goal was beijing gold and he has done great work for it
5609758 todays result is not perfect especially for liu xiang there is great expectation and a great pressure from all for the past 4 years liu xiang has been an athlete with great stability who never drops out of competition easily
5609759 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5609760 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5609761 liu xiang is a great athlete he stands the pressure no other athletes can simply stand
5609762 we didnt realize it was so serious and that it would cause the problem of today
5609763 we didnt want to tell people he couldnt compete because we didnt know at the time
5609764 we go to stores and we look at what gadget best fits our needs and a lot of the time we compromise what we want
5609765 an alternative approach is to allow people to decide what they want
5609766 when apple first came out with their microcomputer there were no applications written for those machines
5609767 then dan bricklin wrote visicalc the first spreadsheet software and then you just had to buy the computer and the application that is how we see bug labs working for everyone
5609768 we want to give any person the chance to create products that might be useful to themselves and not have to rely on the big company offering
5609769 a resistance to new things will be our biggest barricade
5609770 these guys are doing interesting stuff in the sense that one size doesnt fit all the challenge they have is providing solid building blocks for the developers to create useful applications for the hardware
5609771 the microcomputer hardware itself didnt take off at first but when the programs got released they doubled or tripled sales
5609772 we expect the same effect when the modules start shipping and when we have software that makes peoples visions work

5609798 the chinese stock markets steep losses since the olympics began are also denting sentiment towards heavy industry such as steel makers and shipbuilders there are worries the chinese economy may not grow as robustly after the olympics
5609799 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5609800 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5609801 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5609802 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5609803 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5609804 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5609805 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased

5609808 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5609809 i think he has done a great job right now
5609810 i have been here a while so ive seen when they see rookies come in and catch a couple balls and everyone gets excited
5609811 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that he is going to be the next steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
5609812 you kind of have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted to this league i think we also have to put him in a position to make plays thats something this year that will be very important for us to get guys involved and call plays for them
5609813 the biggest thing for me every time i get an opportunity is to do great things for this team
5609814 most teams that we have played play coverages sometimes where they are not pressed and up on receivers like i said they are pretty much vanilla
5609815 she wanted to win and she would run so hard that after some of her races she just practically would lay down for 3 or 4 days
5609816 she would run very very hard and give it all she had every time
5609817 i just told them this could be your last at bat as a team
5609818 after merrell hit the home run i thought we were in good shape

5609820 estoy muy orgulloso del poder de este disco siento como si mis melod as y los arreglos de las canciones hubiesen madurado
5609821 nos parece m s coherente cantar en el idioma que hablamos
5609822 nunca hemos ido de mujeres que tocan hacemos lo que nos gusta sin explotar nuestra condici n sexual y seguramente por eso nunca se nos ha atacado especialmente en ese sentido
5609823 quisimos probar como sonaba nuestra m sica cantada en castellano y en cierta manera nos parec a coherente cantar en el idioma en el que hablamos y del pa s donde vivimos
5609824 hay un buen equilibrio entre las letras de las canciones y la melod a muchas veces hablamos en las canciones de situaciones tristes o dif ciles y con la melod a les damos un empuje de positividad no digo que esto siempre sea as pero es una manera de ver la vida que nos parece interesante
5609825 while the transition to digital music collections has improved and simplified our lives in many ways it has made them more difficult in others
5609826 we created tuneup to make it simple to organize and complete your music collection at the same time we wanted to create a way for people to explore their music and find new content without having to leave itunes as a music lover i use many of the new technologies and services out there yet still felt something fundamental was missing from my own music library this is why we created tuneup
5609827 someone picked up on omar saying it and its stuck with me ever since
5609828 you see him in on a lot of plays out there so i think his progression is going well he certainly makes it hard for offenses when you have a guy like that whos strong and who can run and who can hit
5609829 not only do you have to know the plays for yourself but you have to tell everyone else whats going on
5609830 its just a matter of learning the defense and having a grasp of it at the middle linebacker position where youre in charge of everything he just has to continue to learn
5609831 die in the fight for the gold instead of surviving just for the sake of participation
5609832 a thousand silver medals is not as good as one gold
5609833 for a long time i got very depressed with anxious and complex feelings
5609834 they probably took the ioc web site as the closest thing
5609835 on that you will find countries listed by order by gold medal total and not the total
5609836 i think the old director came out of the military system
5609837 he was really good at what he did he got it into marching order theyre still aiming for the most gold medals but the overall atmosphere has changed in the past four years theyre catching up with world trends with less of a military influence
5609838 they use modern sports psychology rather than political thinking that said lets win glory for the nation now individualism is not only allowed it is encouraged they recognize the audience really likes it earrings funky hairstyles
5609839 he would never give up as long as he can run
5609840 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed

5609842 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5609843 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5609844 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5609845 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about

5609854 varies by topic if you were to compare us to someone like digg a story about apple is ranked the same way as a story about everything else we rank according to these topics
5609855 thats a good question thats come up a few times
5609856 weve been categorized as both a search engine and a publisher but we havent constructed a search engine that crawls the web but this is something thats interesting to us we want to make a place where users can show up and find great stuff this is opposed to users going to a new site and starting from scratch when it comes to finding something interesting
5609857 we noted in our preliminary q3 results as the business and products continue to gain traction infosearch will be launching new products
5609858 trafficbuilder text tuneup is the next in a series of extensions to the trafficbuilder product family that we intend to be rolling out over the coming months

5609862 i came into the 2004 olympics just out of college
5609863 i was very nervous but i told people when you make the final anything can happen i had a far throw and nobody else stepped up
5609864 after about 15 minutes of video i started to walk back to the room
5609865 and who did i see walking in my direction gerd kanter that was a good sign for me
5609866 im not going to be disappointed it is disappointing to know i had a legitimate chance for that podium my last throw i set it up i did everything i wanted to do and the disc just got away from me
5609867 i just came up short its always a learning experience and getting to the second day is an accomplishment for me
5609868 the first soccer player to appear in fhm in a five page photo spread
5609869 shes been very professional the way she treated her body she wanted to get back we gave her time
5609870 i think thats one of the special things about two athletes dating
5609871 youre having your highs youre having your lows youre there for one another i think thats a really really special part of our relationship
5609872 i want to be recognized for my talent on the field i work every day for it hopefully eventually ill be recognized for that
5609873 if i can win another gold that will definitely help
5609874 im more worried about whats going to happen tonight really all you have to do is win the game and theyll cheer they want a winner we want to win theyll cheer if we win and if they dont oh well
5609875 its like man what was i doing last year ive watched my highlight tape i look at things and im like got it i come in here and try to repeat it sometimes it happens sometimes it doesnt but even last year i was looking at myself going ok got it id go into the game and i was able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over this year i just havent been able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over thats the only difference
5609876 defensively hes had some real good games yeah hes been hustling he does early hitting in the cage some days and every now and then he comes out and hits early last year he probably took early hitting hell maybe not at all hes never done that hes probably done more this year than he has in the past
5609877 ive been hitting with my foot in the air a lot if the foot isnt down youre not going to have a good swing youre not going to see the ball anything you can put with a bad swing thats what happens when your foot is in the air your timing is off when your foot is down you recognize pitches earlier you see them better youre able to make a better decision and naturally because you see them earlier you can put a better swing on it you have a better chance of doing something close to what you want to do with the ball
5609878 i think it is hard being prideful when you have a younger brother and a younger sister
5609879 your whole life is trying to lead the way and you have to share nothing is ever yours because you have to bring them in thats part of it
5609880 the worst expletive deleted fans in the world front running expletive deleted
5609881 take a look at history and the way web 1 0 worked publishers didnt make it until the ad dollars started to scale the same mistakes are being made in the social media space today
5609882 i cant imagine a large agency giving a rat about a small firms data advertisers are looking for aggregation of data and someone at a very high level to give an overview of what it means
5609883 we crowd source content from unknown artists around the world and sell it for a dollar
5609884 the internet is a noisy place loud3r is the solution for the noise
5609885 the average digital music collection has more than 1700 tracks from many different sources and this means a typical users library has inaccurate track titles artists and genres
5609886 we are pleased that tuneup is utilizing our technology to provide a fun and intuitive way to keep the collections of music fans accurate and complete
5609887 we built tuneup because we all had disorganized music collections after doing some surveys we learned that the vast majority of music collections have incorrect or missing information
5609888 our strategic relationship with gracenote allows our users to enhance their current itunes experience by providing them integrated access to the worlds largest music database

5609892 we have agreed a fee with newcastle for shola and he spent yesterday at the club having a medical
5609893 we knew from the start that some sites would flourish with many thousands of users and that others would serve the needs of some enthusiasts without garnering a huge amount of traffic
5609894 because of the low cost of launching sites we created a wide network looking at it as a whole our aggregate traffic after 30 days is outstanding
5609895 we believe our partnership with the new media expo is a perfect fit we share a similar vision of podcasting as a rapidly emerging industry
5609896 podcast tune up is on the cutting edge of podcast engineering expanding current design and production methods to create a new formation of industry wide standards we feel well positioned to propel the podcast community forward from a niche to an industry
5609897 im a motorcycle enthusiast and found myself unable to keep track of all the news that was out there on a daily basis thats what prompted me to build loud3r
5609898 i tried using rss readers and other services but only found an overwhelming amount of spam and fake web sites i created loud3r as an intelligent publishing platform that will help millions of people find the content theyre really looking for online
5609899 while the translation to digital music collections has improved and simplified our lives in many ways it has made them more difficult in others we created tuneup to make it simple to organize and complete your music collection at the same time we wanted to create a way for people to explore their music and find new content without having to leave itunes as a music lover i use many of the technologies and services out there yet still felt something fundamental was missing from my own music library this is why we created tuneup
5609900 track 01 or you have some information but are missing the album title you drag that track along with as many as you want to select from the itunes windows to tuneups clean tab
5609901 now we find that of course the money was sent to the general fund and the governor still hasnt paid the cola so im asking him to come forth and be truthful to the people and especially the retirees
5609902 i have decided that in the best interest of both uconn and myself that i will not play college basketball this year
5609903 both uconn and i require a 100 percent dedication to the sport and as of now i feel i cannot give that level of commitment it therefore would be unfair to their excellent program coach geno auriemma the team and uconn fans for me to play
5609904 coach auriemma and the team have been extremely understanding during this time of my transition from high school to college and i thank them for that i am especially grateful to coach auriemma whose kind wisdom has shown me why uconn is such a class program
5609905 i intend to enroll at the university of delaware for my freshman year this fall
5609906 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion
5609907 it takes time but i think he did good out there
5609908 today was a big step for him he did a good job i was impressed with his instincts when we switched off a couple things hopefully come game time hell be 100 percent
5609909 everyone kind of knew i didnt warm up properly i talked to trainers about it its something were going to be doing pregame especially for late games with the monday night games we have i need a routine to get up in the mornings and get going
5609910 it feels good but there definitely is some weakness in there im trying to get the strength and range of motion back a bit but its healing pretty good
5609911 it hurts a little bit just in evaluating the young players giving them game experience and opportunity and then seeing them over the long haul of things
5609912 there is a lot of potential here for involver but all of the responsibility for a successful video launch should not rest solely on their shoulders in order for a brand or company to succeed with their video launch they need to be smart about their marketing its not enough to just use involver to put up a bunch of videos you need a strategy behind it and you have to be creative
5609913 of course who else can get me on the guest list at all the clubs
5609914 why are you doing this you know what you want
5609915 i dont talk about the vice presidential stuff because i think its mostly speculation and i just have stopped talking about it
5609916 i think the one thing that is sort of etiquette in politics is you dont do your vice presidential candidate in a way that competes with the other guys convention you dont do it in a way that sort of rains on his parade
5609917 most people are really unaware how much energy pcs are wasting and we want to draw a lot of attention to that

5609924 today i was told that it is a priority at the studio to find the right direction and if bryan singer is willing to do that fine but if he gets in the way he may not stay on the project
5609925 er doctors have to listen and take the time to appreciate symptoms from patients to treat them appropriately
5609926 in this case for whatever reasons they didnt do so and missed what were obviously neurologic problems that should have led them to order a ct scan
5609927 we feel badly that she has suffered all of these injuries from her very rare cancer
5609928 none of her injuries are related to any failure of theirs
5609929 people on medicaid dont get the same treatment in the emergency room as people with private insurance
5609930 anybody with those symptoms and a blue cross blue shield card or comparable insurance would have been ct scanned on the first visit
5609931 what is more troubling to us in this case is the fact the plaintiffs counsel would introduce issues of ethnic discrimination and discrimination based on insurance status
5609932 temple has more medicaid patients than anyone in the commonwealth of pennsylvania
5609933 i want to see if i could go to college or go to a trade school or something
5609934 it takes the monitoring and the exposure of products of incomplete combustion to yet another level of potential impact on peoples health
5609935 if you have an understanding of how these are formed and then can figure out how they interact in a biological way then you can have a basic understanding of how diseases progress and are formed
5609936 our job is to figure out and determine how to link the exposure with the disease
5609937 were working on determining just what types of radicals the breadth of how many radicals could be formed what sources could be responsible
5609938 i mean come on dude have you even read this blog
5609939 no of course they havent read this blog this is their first time dont be so fucking arrogant
5609940 dass das dfb tor f r alle torh ter der bundesliga offen steht

5609944 die aktuellen datenskandale belegen leider wie dringlich das thema datenschutz ist
5609945 man muss davon ausgehen dass wir nicht einmal die spitze des eisbergs sehen
5609946 je mehr daten vorhanden sind desto mehr menschen kennen diese daten und um so gr er wird das risiko
5609947 ich sehe dringenden handlungsbedarf um den au er kontrolle geratenen datenhandel zu stoppen
5609948 this win is a huge source of satisfaction for both me and my team
5609949 in the absence of my key rivals it was vital for me to take as many points as possible here in order to claim the advantage in the junior world rally championship the rally went well for us but i would have preferred to have continued our duel with martin prokop all the way to the finish at the start of the rally i saw straight away that i could more or less match his times so i chose him as my reference point luckily i was then able to find the right pace on these very quick stages and maintain it all the way to the end at the porta nigra in trier
5609950 i couldnt find the right feeling with the car straight away
5609951 i also made a couple of mistakes on saturday that cost me time but luckily i was able to set some quick times towards the end of the rally and im very happy to take second place now i wasnt very pleased with my fourth place last year but this is a result that i can be proud of
5609952 mom i dont know why you call me the wild child im really not all that wild anymore
5609953 a note from wild child i as most people have been greatly influenced by my parents they inspire and encourage me constantly my fathers limited mobility has given me an appreciation for the experiences that he cannot share with me my mother on the other hand inspires me with her irrational fears yesterday was no exception for some sick reason i enjoy the disapproving looks and disdain in her voice almost more than the act which causes it love you mom talk to you soon
5609954 fine when you go we wont transfer you well put you in as you quit and if the other branch calls for a reference ill give you a bad review and tell them you never came in on time and called out all the time
5609955 hes so big and so global now im sure well try to top it
5609956 we had hoped to have it end at johnny unitas stadium but that may not cut it
5609957 were inviting everyone from brad pitt who appeared on dallas early in his career to robert duvall
5609958 dallas has impacted the lives of some of entertainments most famous people and theyre coming out to celebrate their love of the series

5609960 media from cnn to entertainment tonight have picked up the story access for coverage is the request of the day less than 24 hours after the dallas morning news broke the story over 400 international media outlets picked it up
5609961 we were delighted to have our clenets featured on dallas one of the longest running shows on television
5609962 we jumped at the chance to sponsor this fun event knowing that a portion of the proceeds will benefit the national kidney foundation
5609963 i would love to see a revival of dallas with a new generation of ewings driving their natalia sls 2 sport luxury sedans
5609964 hes definitely one of the greatest athletes ive ever seen in my life
5609965 its humbling for me and for kobe bryant it was unbelievable especially for myself
5609966 going against greece and spain those were easy to get up for this game it might have been easy to come out and have a game where afterward we make excuses but we didnt take a step back and it felt good
5609967 were a good team getting back to square one but its still getting back to square one for the medal round
5609968 defensief vond ik gent perfect maar offensief was het minder
5609969 ik zie wat ik zie gent had altijd de controle maar zoveel spektakel was er niet
5609970 i cant sell this dog food to you unless i see your dog its store policy

5609983 its going to end up being up to coach bill belichick and what he wants to do but i think hes been coaching long enough to understand that the first game in september is whats going to be important for us
5609984 its entirely different than the super bowl same side of the body same leg but not the same injury

5609986 if i can be out there then ill be out there but it remains to be seen we spent some time this weekend getting treatment on my foot and hoping that it responds quickly like it usually does
5609987 watching matt and hearing the criticism on tv i dont even know where that was coming from
5609988 the quarterback there is a lot of responsibility out there i thought matt was making good decisions he was really decisive with his throws was every throw perfect no but that doesnt happen so often anyway
5609989 i see matt in practice every day and the improvement he makes i love what i see from matt i have a lot of confidence in matt
5609990 its great because it feels almost the same in practice as it does in a game
5609991 there is just as much pressure put on us in practice and coach always preaches that perfect practice makes perfect game execution i try to do it in practice and when it carries over to the game its rewarding because youre working all week to have success in a game
5609992 any time you have a good week of practice and it shows in a game you know why you worked that hard each week to get better and it just makes you want to go out and do better next week
