2050000 it was not an issue of space in san francisco
2050001 we just want full access to the bay area for client relationships and recruiting
2050002 the best site on the world wide web although she could cut some of that crazy music she listens to
2050003 this site is not bigger due to lack of access to big piles of money
2050004 i spoke to sen clinton this week shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida and she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think were gonna have a terrific convention
2050005 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2050006 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people supported a whole range of different candidates during the primary are gonna come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that weve got to take the white house back
2050007 there hasnt been controversy other than what you guys are projecting right now
2050008 just because i am not answering your question doesnt mean that it is hard it is getting worked out by our staffs

2050015 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset
2050016 our mobilator shows people just how much their mobile content is worth for many people mobiles are an extension of their daily lives with personal memories once in a lifetime contact details and the odd sexy text holding huge importance putting a cash value on it all seemed the best way to highlight the value of peoples mobile lives the one thing the mobilator cant put a pound sign on is the emotional attachment to your personal content so the message is clear you should protect what is valuable to you
2050017 if you lose your data then often the loss for the individual is much more than the value of the handset itself in most cases the information lost on a mobile is hardly ever retrieved if a handset is stolen the data loss has proven to be the biggest inconvenience and trauma during a theft as you never know who has your details this takes us into the realm of id theft and fraud
2050018 he was free to do what he wanted and its a shame that he isnt coming to us because hes a player who would really have improved this great group but hey it doesnt matter weve got a great group to get started on an important league campaign and fight for all the objectives weve set its a decision we have to accept
2050019 weve already discussed the fact that if we focused too much on cristiano ronaldo and hoped for a lot then we could have a problem especially if whats happening now happened if he didnt come
2050020 now weve signed van der vaart and in three months well have a new signing in the shape of the injured wesley sneijder theres no need now to panic and say we should sign such and such because we really only need players who can improve this group and for a team like real madrid thats difficult
2050021 cristiano has said it all now hes not coming and thats the end of it
2050022 he said it all himself and as i said a few days ago with the group we have here we can aspire to achieve all our objectives theres a great group here both in terms of football and the personalities in the group and were in the right condition to fight for everything its his decision it wasnt to be and now we get on with it
2050023 abydos is archaeologically rich and even more important historically than giza and luxor

2050025 attractiveness is primal its something you cant put your finger on

2050033 these people dont need to be running a day care center they need to shut it down burn it i dont care shut this place down

2050039 the let the market rip squad assured us that such outsourcing would free up resources enabling hospitals to get on with their core business of treating patients
2050040 put simply political conventions keep people too busy to allow them much time for mischief
2050041 amended law has impermissibly chilled their first amendment rights and will negatively affect general voter registration and in particular will affect those who rely on plaintiffs to participate in the political process most harshly such as disabled persons and members of low income communities

2050047 its striking how many states have taken on poverty as a top policy priority
2050048 no one even used the word poverty in the past it was all about helping working families
2050049 these new state and local efforts are important because they reflect a greater level of engagement and commitment by legislators and governors
2050050 states are also putting pressure on the federal government to do more
2050051 a lot of initiatives dont produce good results the political support is there now but if you want an impact on poverty you need a 10 year program
2050052 were bringing people together at the table so the efforts arent just haphazard by individual entities but collaborative and holistic in their approach
2050053 when we showed lawmakers how much poverty and extreme poverty was in their districts it really did change their minds they understood the urgency of taking action

2050113 it is a newer phenomenon where parents have a difficult time letting their children grow and make decisions on their own
2050114 although these parents are truly acting with the best intentions it does sometimes hinder progress that staff makes with a student when it comes to things like course choice and major exploration
2050115 without a ferpa family educational rights and privacy act release staff will not release a majority of the information parents are hoping for thus causing undue stress to the working relationship between parent and child
2050116 if a student is struggling with balancing family influence and wanting to make decisions on their own we always encourage them to come see us without their parents so we can discuss these matters with them

2050131 in the current study we focused on pre existing psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalisation most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt
2050132 one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
2050133 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
2050134 the mccain campaign is determined to give their paris hilton ad a run for its money in the desperation department and theyve succeeded only in shining a light on the fact that the john mccain of today is unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign the new john mccain supports the bush tax giveaways for the wealthy he once denounced opposes his own immigration bill flip flopped on torture and runs negative ads after calling for an honorable campaign frankly it tells you everything about this election that the mccain campaign spins its wheels recycling what we said about john mccain way back when while scrambling and sputtering to explain away governor pawlentys praise of barack obama today

2050181 the construction of settlements anywhere in the occupied palestinian territories including east jerusalem is illegal under international law

2050205 after being put in museums an object can have a second life in a museum context like how people and their loved ones have a different interpretation of one memorial
2050206 initially the word held little meaning to me but as i was working on my thesis i realized that this isnt just the climax of my undergrad and mfa work but also a new beginning
2050207 after graduation from the mfa program there are many possibilities such as pursuing phds teaching being a studio technician going into administrative work in the field and then there is the starving artist route seriously though there are many emerging artists in calgary making a good living selling their art
2050208 hes inspired lots of people to drive responsibly and safely its important and thats why we chose him
2050209 the whole experience was quite surreal actually i didnt know where to look because he kept his helmet on and his visor down the whole time
2050210 its odd speaking to this man and you have no idea what he looks like
2050211 yes the stig did attack us he has irrational fears and apparently one of them happens to be scouts
2050212 the tussle between us was purely comical and having spoke to the stig for a long period of time he soon conquered his fear of scouts
2050213 these individuals have all been identified by a panel of scouts as positive role models for young people today
2050214 we are delighted to have awarded them the appropriate badges to celebrate the birthday of scouting
2050215 this is normal its not shameful it is everyones need to to have food and be nourished and nurtured
2050216 this is for all businesses including airlines clothing stores pools and restaurants
2050217 ive set my sights on providing spectators with one of edinburghs best free shows
2050218 it is the first thing you think when you evaluate it can i go on i want to do what is best for the team
2050219 but these are the cards i was dealt and what i have to play
2050220 with each dismount im more comfortable and able to handle it better ill be ready
2050221 i hurt it in a morning workout and then i was back in the afternoon without doing dismounts and the next day trying to prove i could compete i told them id do whatever i can for the team
2050222 the best part is she was still able to have confidence and train
2050223 she didnt take any time off just the bars without a dismount for one day then it was full routines she had to rally quickly we are at the olympics and there is no time for crying you have to get in and do your job
2050224 i give a lot of credit to her colleagues we did not have to lobby them at all they decided this is the best team we have chellsie is part of this team and can provide the bar routine they need
2050225 then i said ok this is the new plan we had to change the whole plan just for bars
2050226 im still here and able to compete in the olympics im still an olympian
2050227 consistent with our comments at the end of the first quarter we were aggressive on markdowns at the chicos brand to help drive business and manage inventory levels to lower comparable store sales trends while this resulted in lower earnings for the quarter our inventories are better positioned as we go into fall season our balance sheet remains strong with meaningful free cash flows expected through the remainder of the year we currently have no debt and approximately 275 million in cash and marketable securities additionally we continue to focus on expense control throughout the organization
2050228 it was probably still warm but it felt like a cold front came through it was a good practice we stayed healthy and got some good work we worked a lot in the throwing game
2050229 we have five or six guys that have an opportunity to play as freshmen running back travis miller has a chance to play obviously markelle defensive back markelle martin is going to play defensive backs victor johnson and johnny thomas have a chance to play and im probably leaving someone out
2050230 i think were in good shape we dont have a lot of fat on our team and we have good chemistry other than keith toston weve stayed healthy we just have to keep practicing hard and get ready for the scrimmage
2050231 her face started turning red and she couldnt breathe and i just popped up and did the heimlich

2050233 shell wishes to immediately pass these savings on to our customers thus allowing us to reduce the price of our fuel products by 20 cents a gallon
2050234 tell all the gas stations to drop prices some more
2050235 every time they make a 30 run they have to put like 20 gas in order for them to keep moving
2050236 the puc is continually looking for the most recent updates to fuel costs in their consideration for fuel surcharge increases
2050237 if this trend continues it should contribute to a reduction in the fuel surcharge
2050238 we wanted to meet some of the folks on the ballot
2050239 i want to know whos going to be on the ballot and who im voting for
2050240 thats why the public needs to understand that prosecutors and police are all law enforcement in the state of florida its up to us to enforce the laws of the state of florida we have to work as a team or these criminals are going to end this war
2050241 ive put people on death row ive sent people to prison for the rest of their lives and ive kept juveniles from breaking the law with our prevention programs i think the answer to the question is someone who could do both of those things we can stop murderers by stop creating future murderers
2050242 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2050243 we now offer a plugin manager where users can add third party plugins to our software we also allow a lot more file compatibilities which allow other types of files to be attached to planswift jobs this includes attaching files such as pdfs and e mails to a planswift job and breaking up jobs and files to send as e mail
2050244 our july comparable store sales reflect continuation of a very difficult and highly promotional market consistent with our approach through the first half of the year we remain focused on tightly managing all aspects of our business as we enter the important back to school selling season
2050245 we also remain on course with the arden b merchandising transition we started in the first quarter this year though we have been very cautious with overall inventory levels during the early evaluation stage of this effort as of the end of july approximately 70 of arden b inventory now reflects our new strategy and sell through rate on this merchandise during july exceeded the divisions rate as a whole
2050246 cost reduction flexibility compliance with operators requirements and short time to market are extremely important to the device manufacturer
2050247 the integration of tis m shield hardware based security and discretix cprm security client on the ti omap 3 platform gives device oems the design advantage industry standard content protection and future proofed drm architecture they need
2050248 with mobile devices playing an increasingly central role in entertainment and related services the need for cost effective standards based drm solutions offering fast time to market is essential
2050249 we believe the discretix multi scheme drm client leveraging tis complete m shield hardware backed security platform on omap 3 devices is an exceptional choice that meets not only these requirements but also delivers the speed of operation oems and end users demand
2050250 content access technologies play important roles as both enablers and protectors of music video games and tv 4c entitys cprm technology allows such forms of entertainment to be enjoyed by a broad audience across many different devices and platforms

2050255 subscribers in brazil russia and later this year china are migrating to 3g which in turn will lead to a 2g and 2 5g to 3g subscriber migration process in 2008 however current gsm deployment patterns remain unabated with double digit gsm subscriber growth rates being common in bric countries
2050256 we didnt have any fear last season and weve got to look at it the same way just work hard and our ability and team spirit will come out hopefully we can go one better this time and make it automatic promotion
2050257 i dont think it was luck last year weve got a good group of footballers and i didnt feel the opposition last season was in any way that far better than us
2050258 ive had a really good pre season with wolves and feel really fit and strong and raring to go its just that match sharpness now which you can only get through playing games
2050259 birmingham have got a lot of quality and im sure with the squad weve got were going straight back up
2050260 the injury situation is what it is well get to the end of the week and hopefully have an improvement in one or two players
2050261 its straight into the deep end with three games in seven days and the squad will be tested to its fullest depth
2050262 you hope for a good start to give a good first impression but still recognise it will be a tough challenge over the year
2050263 the first month will determine a lot of things as regards the capability of teams and their ambitions every game is difficult theres no such thing as an easy fixture especially in the first month everyone is bubbly full of energy and its a difficult start every teams agenda is still to be determined so it will be an eye opener
2050264 the 2008 version of the focus rs includes front style changes as well as engine improvements style changes to the grill area reflect the looks of the recently previewed focus rs road car
2050265 a new turbo and crankshaft will also increase the range of power available
2050266 i had two really good days covering 230km on the first day and 200km on the next it was 30 c and clear blue skies so i hope the rally is like that
2050267 i learned a lot about the tyres and i believe i have a better set up for this rally than the last asphalt event in monte carlo
2050268 late antiquity 3 as well as our lingering preoccupation with concepts of decline fall continuity and change and their cousin
2050269 when one side sees their own country as the problem and the other side sees their own country as the solution somebody tell me where you compromise with that
2050270 gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart
2050271 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2050272 but from this there have been positives as the attention of the world is now on china and their human rights record is in the spotlight
2050273 we appreciate morgans cooperation and are pleased that it has agreed to perform this thorough review of all its city and town clients in the commonwealth in order to determine whether additional reimbursements are appropriate
2050274 cities and towns need every available dollar in their budget particularly during these stressful economic times
2050275 this is a situation were going to stay on top of
2050276 weve lost a lot of the battles but we havent lost the war

2050279 this is an opportunity to transport the successes in st louis to more than 700 chapters across the country and further strengthen red cross disaster response and preparedness
2050280 st louis success is in large part due to the enormous community support from the board donors volunteers and community leaders who believe in the mission of the red cross and the basic humanitarian need to take care of people in times of disaster and emergencies
2050281 the banks that offered the credit cards really wanted you to start using them and become dependent on them
2050282 enormous series of networking lanes that connects east coast with west coast
2050283 if i have broadband in my house which i do that gives me faster access to anything outside
2050284 you add more dynamic content to your familys web site you can add 100 megabytes of family photos or even movies
2050285 take that a step further and you can have interactive tours of the backyard
2050286 the more houses that you have connected with broadband then the more youre loading up that backbone and the more i use the backbone the more it takes away from someone elses ability to use the backbone
2050287 theres not a whole lot that im gonna want to do with it
2050288 if i set up a web site with dial up the person trying to access my web site would die of boredom before the page finished downloading
2050289 the fact that taking it away would cause such a mass amount of chaos means that the internet service providers much like credit card companies have an awful lot of power
2050290 theyll test the waters and see where people fall and stop using their products or where they grumble and moan a lot but still use their products
2050291 thats where they can continue to charge the customer higher fees and thus make more money
2050292 imagine youre on hillsborough and dan allen is crossing at hillsborough and youve got a stoplight all the packets come through like little cars
2050293 the stoplight allows traffic to pass through it also shuffles the cars
2050294 say it takes a look at your license plate and say youre going to cary its going to send you forward onto the direction of gorman street if youre another car and youre heading south its going to turn you onto dan allen it does this for every piece of network traffic that goes through
2050295 it could be as early as later this year it might not be until next year or 2010
2050296 im fairly certain that by 2010 we will be seeing the caps
2050297 we were pleased to see that the majority of those who responded are in favour of the measures discussed in the plan
2050298 if anyone has ever thought about travelling working or going to school outside of canada the youth service officers at the service canada centre for youth are ready to help explore those options
2050299 i have spent years promoting the message of water safety and drowning prevention im honored to be a part of this history making event during the month of august which is drowning impact awareness month drowning is the leading cause of death for infant and young children in our state and its 100 percent preventable as a city we must educate and continue to spread this life saving message to residents
2050300 when kids get involved their lives and the lives of those they touch change in the process if our event can save one child from drowning or near drowning all of the work will have been worth it
2050301 im sure thats how all parents feel also when they come in to drop off their kids on the first day of school they are nervous and worried if their kids are going to be ok especially if they are new
2050302 its easier for them to transition from summer if everything looks nice and colorful
2050303 you know some of the kids dont want to come back but this makes them a little bit more comfortable here and you want them to feel welcome in your classroom
2050304 its still exciting with me working here its so nice to have them back its quiet when theyre not here and you do get a lot done but you do really miss them they are part of your everyday lives for 180 days a year
2050305 at the end of the school you are happy because you know you helped move them up to the next level
2050306 but at the beginning you get a whole new group and you get to start again they are all different
2050307 clear lack of transparency in the council decision making process
2050308 people have said that the council is becoming very split with decisions being made along party lines as a councillor you have got to leave party loyalties at the door
2050309 a lot of people who supported me have also supported peter i dont as you shouldnt want to trade off that legacy to win here in orange im running for council as me and not as a potential replacement for peter andren
2050310 fec chairman donald mcgahn indicated at a commission meeting july 28 that the fec could consider issuing advisory rulings on pressing issues in the run up to the november election including questions about permissible pre election activity that may have been raised by the shays iii ruling mcgahn said that political parties and others may have questions about issues such as whether their plans for get out the vote activities comply with the law
2050311 thisll be the last time i set foot in this apartment and thisll be the last time you set foot in this apartment
2050312 after long discussions with director el shafie i became convinced that a film with a linear plot would have the greatest chance of making it into production
2050313 so we worked together on my original script getting rid of some characters and finding new dimensions for others it took us about a year to come up with a revised script that would fit within the production budget all in all the film was written in a kind of workshop atmosphere with the director collaborating on the screenplay
2050314 we talked through the film together discussing how to express the feelings of the young woman who is at the centre of the film she is in love with a young pilot but she feels she cannot marry him since she is scared of the idea of marriage
2050315 i found my niche by using modern techniques such as manipulating the narrative line and juxtaposing different characters at different times however what has really influenced me has been the kind of films that have been coming out of southeast asia
2050316 even when you are tackling big issues they can be made more real for people if they are approached in a light way
2050317 i am against melodrama as a way of delivering serious messages
2050318 my job is to find a bright area in human life even if i talk about death in my film it is a way of finding humour even in the saddest situations
2050319 tamir ezzat and i decided to develop a new idea out of our previous film and we finally came up with a new scenario the new film again revolves around the concept of home this time through the perceptions of three young people they present their ideas of homeland and their visions of what home could be however different their views might be they are all connected by the fact that each person was born on the same day now that we have finished writing the script we have to start looking for a producer
2050320 it is short sighted since it is only possible to find a producer for films that deal with subjects that have already had proven success with egyptian audiences
2050321 which runs counter to the fact that cinema production always entails some sort of risk
2050322 the result has been that the cinema scene in egypt today has become one of
2050323 while there are exceptions to this rule yousri nasrallahs fish garden for example puts the viewer in a quite different mood because of his different style of narration in general our generation is the product of a fading culture i am no exception to this but i want to make some sort of breach in what has been a narrowing circle
2050324 should appeal to a particular audience not to the audience in general this misconception of the target audience results in movies all looking the same and seeking to satisfy only one audience
2050325 for my part i want to write about different age groups not just about young people i want to write about men in their seventies women in their forties and all those marginal characters whom we rarely see on screen i want to write about the character of my own grandfather about men in general not just about young women
2050326 i might be the opposite of a feminist in fact
2050327 though i do not really know what the opposite might be
2050328 the problem with being a feminist writer is that you can fall into the trap of defending a certain category of people at the expense of all others denial of a part of the picture is not the right thing to do i believe that some men might be repressed by women and i have a horror of the notion of women in general being just the victims of men
2050329 the work of my generation of scriptwriters relates to global issues and to stories that could take place anywhere on the globe and not just in egypt
2050330 our works lie somewhere in the middle while they can look unoriginal from a western point of view they are still debatable from a local perspective
2050331 youll spend five hours on the road just to hear a man sing
2050332 but why pay le350 to listen to music you already have at home
2050333 if you already have a ticket hold it up in the air
2050334 if i wasnt a dj i would be a chef
2050335 tiesto has the sense of creating seamless transitions between back to back tracks which is called the beat matching technique
2050336 if you dont stay long enough on the dance floor the dj is not good enough
2050337 has the ability to spontaneously manipulate or restructure existing recordings to create new compositions unrecognisable from their original form
2050338 i think the only way forward for djs is to play a diverse mix of sounds
2050339 hes going on saturday to meet the leaders of the political parties involved in the sadc mandated talks facilitated by south africa

2050342 the artists are excited to share their work with others and the visitors like the interaction
2050343 what our artists and visitors especially like being surrounded by our wonderful historic 19th century buildings with many of these fine structures home to great shops galleries and restaurants many festivals are held in fields or on parking lots postoffice street has a european ambience tree lined streets and pavestone sidewalks lined with bistro tables and chairs its a great combination of history and art
2050344 fijian is the name not only for the indigenous fijian people but also for the land and the culture
2050345 you may stay in japan for 100 years but that does not make you japanese japanese is a name of a race and its culture just like fijian is for fiji
2050346 just because you live in an area does not make you the native of that area
2050347 it is part of their psyche and part of them
2050348 this is contained in our 1997 constitution this common name has not been used publicly
2050349 the problem is that the name fiji islander has not been promoted and marketed both locally and abroad
2050350 with decades of experience solving customers complex problems with innovative communications products and services we expect the combined embedded solution partners and continuous computing team to have broader market presence opportunities and capabilities
2050351 i am delighted to join such a well established and respected company as continuous computing and am excited about the opportunity for us to continue growing our revenue and customer base through an expanded set of offerings
2050352 from the inception of embedded solution partners we focused on best in class embedded software and services from the highest caliber partners in the business working with the trillium team at continuous computing and having access to a complete lineup of atca and cpci products is a dream opportunity
2050353 bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that allows the minority the right to offer its alternatives
2050354 this could substantially alter the requirements for separation distances between lead and following aircraft in airport traffic patterns
2050355 dual display technology allows people to work more efficiently thanks to additional screen real estate however dual display technology is usually limited to discrete graphics cards or micro atx motherboards our zotac nforce 630i itx enables users that want smaller than micro atx systems to enjoy the same capabilities
2050356 the integrated geforce 7100 graphics processor also allows users to drive dual monitors without any lag or slow downs as well
2050357 when we first released our zotac nforce 610i itx people loved the size form factor and capabilities however they demanded dvi output capabilities for home theater pc duties our engineers went back to the drawing board and added a dvi output and hdcp compliance for more demanding users
2050358 with the addition of the dvi output the nforce 630i itx makes a powerful platform for dual monitor and home theater pc users
2050359 the brac was not really anticipated but is definitely the number one driver behind our growth
2050360 were very blessed here its kind of a boom that el paso hasnt had before
2050361 its been difficult finding the right trades people because of the boom
2050362 were a town of 700 000 so our depth isnt quite there
2050363 you may for example have only two electrical subcontractors available to you if you need more it puts a strain on the citys available subcontractor base
2050364 texas is worried about highways and infrastructure and is trying to do something about it
2050365 i think to remain successful in the future we must get bigger and bigger
2050366 i was taught that one should keep a low profile because otherwise you might become a target
2050367 the kids have been trying out and qualifying all week long
2050368 its been a busy week we dont have a lot of time before we have to start playing in tournaments and matches well need continual preparation
2050369 once we start we play a lot in a short time i really try to encourage them to play a lot and practice a lot the more they do the smoother the transition is
2050370 if were successful enough to get an individual or our team up there its a great practice round
2050371 starting the season we hope to wind up there were working ourselves towards the end of the season
2050372 its not real long its tight the greens are fast and it requires a demanding shot the more you can see a place like that the better
2050373 i kind of look at it as just another tournament
2050374 its similar to many other tournaments that we could be in at that time its similar to the big cat and competition wise its still there it starts the season off where kids know that they have to focus right away
2050375 we need to continually improve around the greens and also in our course management strategy
2050376 on just having a plan on how to attack each hole to know the right target to try and hit at we need to know when to be aggressive and when to be conservative its like playing different teams we have to have a different plan for different places its about being disciplined enough to follow the plan versus just trying to blast the ball around the golf course
2050377 i did everything on it except for the paint and the upholstery
2050378 this is the first indication we have had that there is going to be a distinction between the dance forms it will be extremely difficult for rambert to maintain its position if we are not able easily to continue recruiting dancers from around the world
2050379 the loss to the cultural life of this country will be devastating when you are talking about internationalism it is not just a question of bringing companies from overseas into britain 25 of our dancers are from outside the european union i am sure this is an unintended consequence of what the government is trying to do but i would plead with them to listen to the industry in terms of the impact that this could have if they dont get it right
2050380 these companies attract the most exceptional dancers from across the world who specifically desire to work with leading british companies and artistic directors
2050381 without their talent britains international status in dance will be diminished and the dance economy weakened
2050382 all dancers whether specialising in flamenco tango ballet or contemporary dance to name just a few experience the same levels of rigorous training and we certainly agree that contemporary dance should receive equal visa concessions
2050383 i am recording another album soon ive got a protools machine downstairs in my house now which i record from home now i cant turn the f ing thing on laughs its like the brain of the house but when you have somebody who knows what they are doing its so easy to make records now its not even funny the art of making records is somewhat diminishing its taking the passion out of it but i will try to give it as much real me as i can theres so many tricks i can use i want to make two albums make one and go out on that one and make another one and go out on that time is very valuable to me now im 60 this december it does not seem 10 years since i was 50 it really doesnt my mission now is to do as much as i can
2050384 everything from doping disputes to eligibility issues well be there
2050385 but we will be just concentrating solely on the opposition that is in front of us our process is one fight at a time and we will not be looking ahead to who we will be boxing next or anything like that
2050386 imagine youre in a parking lot and suddenly see a car drive by with a 3 year old child sitting on top it
2050387 isra l a ajout sa voix au concert international des condamnations en expliquant nous avons soutenu le processus d mocratique en mauritanie et continuerons le faire
2050388 les auteurs du coup de force vont perdre le soutien financier de la communaut internationale
2050389 i cant even imagine they have to be so worried on one hand and also when this is the only hope you have you do anything even if you have to let go of your child
2050390 she has a poor prognosis and she probably couldnt survive
2050391 i wish it wasnt taken as an offense to the chinese
2050392 its a shame because bocog has done such a fantastic job the city its almost an entirely different city from what we saw in december so it is a shame
2050393 every single day ive thought about these games i thought about my last experience here and being sick and just missing out on that one ride and potentially missing out on my whole olympic opportunity
2050394 so naturally its a worry coming back to the same place
2050395 whatever an athlete feels they need to do to properly prepare for their competition as long as its within the rules those choices are at the discretion of the athletes
2050396 unfortunately its not just this person or that person its cyclists and i dont want any negativity coming down on this sport as a whole we have enough problems on our own
2050397 i will continue to wear my mask where i deem fit
2050398 its my life and health in the long run and i would never do something that would purposefully or intently harm the best interest or the public view of either my country or other countries in attendance
2050399 airplanes and airports are just breeding grounds for germs as an athlete in peak physical form our immune systems are actually lower than normal had i been flying anywhere in the u s i would have been wearing a mask just being around that many people its the same thing
2050400 we still believe that there is weakness in the economy however there is also inflation
2050401 this mornings numbers on jobless claims continued to support the thesis that job creation is minimal if not negative
2050402 the bears were looking for a reason to sell and aig provided it
2050403 puts pressure on other players like ubs hsbc merrill lynch to do the same thing
2050404 look the only way you can be successful the only way you can break into the industry is by signing with a major by selling them the masters the publishing doing the 360 deal for the merch and the performance rights
2050405 hes doing time over reebok pumps hes doing life over some sneakers that dont even help you jump higher
2050406 look if its a movimiento if its really a movement for our people how come we dont own it how come theres still other executives that have nothing to do with our culture that are controlling the message that we send to our people havent we learned anything from hip hop
2050407 if this had been a sunday id have canceled mass
2050408 a dui checkpoint in itself is certainly valid and we support public safety
2050409 but at the same time the potential for racial profiling is there we have to be realistic about it
2050410 write them a ticket and hope they show up for court
2050411 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
2050412 i have attended the new level 7 on 7 in las vegas barton marketing workout competitive edge combine nike camp in eugene
2050413 as of now im just training for my senior year trying to have a big senior year
2050414 that is what a lot of the colleges are looking for before anything serious offers begins from a few coaches from colleges that have told me that
2050415 i will be taking an unnofficial visit to western washington d 2
2050416 also i will be taking frequent visits to them uw this august i iook to stop by portland state this september to see a game and visit the staff i love the location it is right in the heart of portland hopefully i can make a game out in idaho as well as well as idaho state
2050417 this year will be a little bit of a switch for me position wise
2050418 i will be playing rb h back instead of te a move best for the team made by my coaches
2050419 it was a horrible horrible decision but at the end of the day were a company that has to do whats best for the company weve got to stay in business and the numbers just didnt add up
2050420 by the end of this month im confident that we will have confirmation of renewed revenue funding from the arts council
2050421 the city council has already confirmed funding last week of 274 000 annually
2050422 with the funding confirmed well be setting out to recruit a new team this will include a new management board that will be chaired initially by me as executive chair with two director posts one will be artistic director and the other will be called business development director one director will be focused on the art and the production and one focused on the business and public facing activities sales and front of house that sort of thing
2050423 i think too often theatres are overly prescriptive or they expect one person to have every skill
2050424 the artistic director will be the clear leader of the team but we will then build the team around their skills and talent im an absolute believer you need that range of skills that goes from producer to excellent director but you dont necessarily find that in one person if people want to get in touch with us before we formerly advertise in september then were up for that
2050425 now he belongs to the ages a presentation of abraham lincolns life death and funeral
2050426 gt chuck fricke of fricke calvert schrader funeral home at left and virgil davis founder of the museum of funeral customs in springfield display a photo of abraham lincolns casket being lowered into his tomb in springfield
2050427 now he belongs to the ages a presentation of abraham lincolns life death and funeral
2050428 the most interesting historical endeavor ive ever embarked on strange but neat and different
2050429 theyre exactly the kind of thing visitors tell us they want to see experiential travel
2050430 it also gets us in touch with what life was like back then
2050431 im proud to support this effort on behalf of the 42 counties in the lincoln heritage area this is a great place to have it
2050432 from the inside out from the perspective of a funeral director
2050433 then betty hickey widow of lincoln expert james hickey found out
2050434 then ron keller curator of the lincoln college museum found out and then the state bank of lincoln
2050435 thursday during the day and friday we will change the funeral home into the 1860s
2050436 but it is also a good date that will help haimish remember our wedding anniversary
2050437 the objective is not to win the scrimmage but rather to evaluate our players our schemes and their mastery of the schemes and techniques that weve been working awfully hard on thus far
2050438 we call things on both sides of the ball because were looking for answers
2050439 it may be whether or not weve got an answer to a play that causes us a problem defensively or whether or not this player or that player is an answer as far as providing us with some depth at a certain position theres a whole series of things that well take a look at and those are a couple of them
2050440 theres no question at all that its football season now that weve started hitting
2050441 well back off considerably friday and just go out in shells because weve already hit enough to satisfy us for this particular point in the week we have to save some for saturday
2050442 the one element that you can never evaluate until you do it is the physical element how someone is going to react to contact mcdaniels added
2050443 there are guys who are better players than we thought once were allowed to hit and there are guys who arent as good as we thought once contact begins thats always the last element to the puzzle it sort of brings things into focus as to whos good and who needs to get better and whos really good
2050444 we use the seven days we had in the summer to install some things and when two a days came around we picked up where we left off and went on to new things and other things
2050445 the defense expands the offense expands and you expand attention to special teams and other units what we aspire to do is strike a balance between installing additional things and polishing and making better the things weve already installed
2050446 its always important to realize that our kids focus is internal and that were paying attention to details and that were trying to be precise in what we do
2050447 throughout these practices we really have no opponent to prepare for and so our focus should be internal
2050448 i met him in 2000 at the houston grand prix and hed just been honored as the driver of the century
2050449 he was probably the nicest celebrity ive ever met so when i heard he was going to be here i wanted to meet him again and say hello
2050450 i think its wonderful what theyve been able to accomplish
2050451 this hasnt been the best year for the team but that happens some years are tougher than others
2050452 on monday i paid 3 50 for a pint now all of a sudden its 3 90 i was shocked i complained to staff they have got two prices regulars prices and non regulars prices
2050453 there is no price list on the wall i dont mind paying more but it is completely arbitrary it is not the money it is the price hike it is outrageous
2050454 we are pleased with our july sales performance particularly in light of the continued challenging economic environment
2050455 business was particularly strong during the latter part of the month due to our semi annual home and back to school promotions
2050456 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
2050457 you know i have eaten that stuff when ive had one of those before and it has never helped
2050458 these data add a new twist to the association and suggest that periodontal disease may be there before diabetes
2050459 we found that over two decades of follow up individuals who had periodontal disease were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life when compared to individuals without periodontal disease
2050460 this could be suggestive that the people who lost all of their teeth had a history of infection at some point but subsequently lost their teeth and removed the source of infection
2050461 this is particularly interesting as it supports previous research originating from the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study invest which has shown that individuals lacking teeth are at intermediate risk for cardiovascular disease
2050462 the statement that obama does not have enough experience to be president or to keep the country safe is code for hes a black man and we dont trust him hes uppity as well
2050463 while i realize that 2 hours is a long time in radio land i think the friday show can spend the entire 2 hours on issues and really unpack some of them the second hour was a waste of time to me who cares about reality tv and real estate agents training to crab fisherman why is this being covered
2050464 i had been thinking a lot about peter and the wolf and i wanted to evoke a fairytale warm summery version of that but using one of my girls in place of peter i imagine this girl and her friend to be sitting in a field at twilight and the viewer kind of imposes on them in my mind they are perfectly friendly but i love how dark the wolf is and the less detailed he or she is seems to make it all the more mysterious the girls solemn stare and the unsure wolf make you want to slowly back off from them and i love the contrast of that while everything else is dancing and thriving around them
2050465 there was an important problem with the player he belongs to chelsea
2050466 we had the utmost respect for the position he was in because he was owned by another club and it wasnt easy for him to come
2050467 it seemed as if there was a chance of signing him but then we realised it was impossible and so we thought it was best not to spend six months chasing him
2050468 the influence is still there that they want it to happen they probably themselves dont have a day set to do it but theyre waiting for an opportunity and something will come along
2050469 clothes are considered a sign of personality for they reveal the social customs that a society is accustomed to
2050470 colours in our society have an ideological meaning often with magical or medicinal connotations for example the colour red is used to cure measles beads the colour of amber are used to cure some illnesses and to dispel the evil eye
2050471 during the ptolemaic graeco roman rule black and gold were favoured by the greeks however after the christian religion appeared black was used by priests in churches it also is a symbol of abstinence
2050472 the kola was a uniform the king or ruler gave out as a reward
2050473 throughout the ages society was divided into various social classes where the higher classes were those whose clothes were distinguished by their richness and the decoration gold and silver thread was used for the rich as well as studding them with precious stones diamonds turquoise and emeralds
2050474 i like wearing western clothes as they are practical and eastern as they are artistic and aesthetic
2050475 the latest from the best fashion houses as well as personal taste the cut must fit you first
2050476 now that there is globalisation it is easy to get acquainted with the european and american culture via the internet if youth really turned to our heritage they would find beautiful things in addition to this our factories in egypt always copy western models and designs where are our egyptian fashion designers for youth to choose they must have two things to choose from but they have only one
2050477 ibn khaldoun said six centuries ago the defeated is constantly bewitched by the victor and imitates him since we feel internally defeated by the west we imitate it hence the imitation in clothing appearance accent and lifestyle in general
2050478 we need a renaissance a revival of the egyptian heritage whether the oriental pharaonic coptic or islamic a renaissance so that our heritage can be transformed into a market worthy product that can be popular in all countries of the world
2050479 the sudanese citizen has a national fashion the galabiya and the emmah the turban the gulf native has the ghotra and eqal the head cord and scarf and the moroccan has the moroccan galabiya our national fashion was the galabiya but it is now only worn at home
2050480 we lack nothing at all it is only a question of marketing and having good connections abroad
2050481 i was wondering if youve found a good alternative to endust or pledge for dusting
2050482 the only positive is that the season hasnt started yet
2050483 we said from the start that we wanted the league and we have a bit of pressure on us now to win it
2050484 celtic have a bit of momentum and there are other teams who will be much stronger but it all starts on saturday
2050485 things will come together there are a lot of scottish boys here and they know what its all about we will need to get it together and that will start on saturday
2050486 it was always going to be a pressure game first game of the season away to home to a good team and now there is a wee bit more pressure but we will be up for it
2050487 we have no european football now so everyone has to focus on the league and that starts on saturday
2050488 come saturday its going to take men to go out and take the ball and play but thats what we are going to have to do
2050489 we will have to regroup for the next couple of days and have a right shot at it on saturday
2050490 a connoisseur of mopping manny notices its a slapdash job wet mopped but not rinsed so the dirt is drying in a switchbacked ribbon yet out of professional respect he detours around it
2050491 the tamil tigers were actually the most prolific adopter of suicide terrorism in the world credited with over 150 attacks 191 is one estimate
2050492 the tamil tigers in sri lanka became a non muslim and non middle eastern early adopter in 1987
2050493 alternatively the ltte especially at the outset conceptualized suicide attacks very differently they used suicide bombing more as a substitute for military operations they could not complete with conventional means making them asymmetric but closer to the traditional military sense of the term the tamils thought about suicide bombing more for hard targets and assassinations not necessarily targeting civilians though civilians often died in their attacks
2050494 it was a great delusion that any property in bulgaria promised generous profitability
2050495 unfortunately a combination of the aforementioned factors contributed to a reflux of the major group foreign buyers coming from britain and ireland
2050496 pressed by the higher interest rates on their mortgages and the increasing fuel and food prices people are forced to carefully prioritise
2050497 we should not ignore the fact that the reflux of foreign buyers is additionally stimulated by the frequent bad foreign press about bulgaria and the lack of state strategy for tourism development
2050498 we have been living in it since january 2008 but needed money and decided to sell
2050499 it is unreasonable to talk about selling at a loss
2050500 but let us not forget that good location and quality are definitive for higher selling or rental prices
2050501 i started the newspaper with the support from the local russian speaking community who volunteered to help with articles design and distribution
2050502 i started it because there was not a single newspaper throughout the whole state that would serve the russian speaking community
2050503 our texas is special as it is not the yellow press we do not have horoscopes or dating information there we try to maintain the level and reflect whatever our community might want and need to read in the paper
2050504 the idea of the newspaper is that it should have all the information about and for the russian speaking community about their new home country
2050505 the newspaper will help them to assimilate into the local community and to identify themselves more as americans they russian speaking community should not feel like guests in this land
2050506 we try to provide the local community with the news that is interesting to them we try to translate all the available information about politics culture business you know not everybody reads english news
2050507 he was carrying this bag like a messenger bag that he carried during both robberies
2050508 he was also wearing the same hat as the banknorth robbery
2050509 after seeing the td banknorth photo the people at framingham cooperative bank said it was the same person
2050510 they may be successful initially and they think success breeds more success
2050511 the decision to rebrand under the metro name is part of a long term strategy to capitalize on operational and marketing efficiencies by uniting the individual strengths of our existing banners in ontario and sharing best practices with our quebec and ontario stores
2050512 it will show a lot if they were doing some sort of action
2050513 its nice to see that somebody takes a real look at our team its nice to be recognized as a legitimate powerhouse this year
2050514 but when the seasons over that ranking wont mean a thing
2050515 we enjoy hard work thats what we pride ourselves on
2050516 its frustrating saidcanfield who started the first nine games last season before being injured at usc
2050517 i was expecting to be 100 percent im anxious but at the same time i have to be patient
2050518 i really have to be on my horse to make sure i have everything in line to make sure i have everything down before the first game comes around
2050519 not all man is human but all human are man
2050520 several people close to thomas jefferson or the monticello community believed that he was the father of sally hemings children
2050521 suggests the strong likelihood that thomas jefferson and sally hemings had a relationship over time that led to the birth of one and perhaps all of the known children of sally hemings
2050522 rich men had courtesans for pleasure and concubines for quick sex
2050523 that we could change sexual norms to say encourage new york waitresses to look on being mistresses as a cool option
2050524 one of our primary goals for this expansion was to bring in the latest gaming technology to meet the demands of our players
2050525 pokerpro fits our needs perfectly while allowing us total flexibility to adjust game offerings and tournament schedules
2050526 we are delighted to begin our field trial in the state of indiana and increase our presence in the mid west weve proven that players in this region accept and appreciate the benefits of automated poker
2050527 we are pleased that our partnership with harrahs has allowed us to be part of such an amazing property
2050528 ill be honest with you weve got anywhere from eight to 10 guys right now that i feel have really taken that role and are expecting it from the team
2050529 theyre not on an ego trip its not an ego thing ive been real happy with the balance we have at practice on the field off the field in the weight room sometimes its just one of those things where the kids get it theyre all pretty focused and obviously they all want to be successful
2050530 weve got a couple of underclassmen who have stepped up actually its been a pretty good balance of leaders
2050531 the funny thing about leadership is that its not always the people that talk
2050532 sometimes its about how you approach practice and dictate the tempo of practice we talk about that with our guys as well
2050533 its one of the reasons why we always tell them the one thing you cant measure in football is your heart no matter how big you are or how fast you are thats an equation in football its not always the guys who are speaking up its the guys who bring it every day in practice and set the tempo for practice which shows leadership
2050534 the thing is you cant teach someone to be a leader necessarily
2050535 some people are just natural its just a natural part of them i dont necessarily go up to someone and say you know what you have to be a leader on this team because some guys arent those talkers and some guys are i kind of let it fall into place and fortunately for us its been pretty good
2050536 if we have five voters who are all close well have five captains if we have three voters who are head and shoulders above everybody else well have three captains a lot of it is going to depend on the voting
2050537 last years pink light district was a huge success and we are excited to bring it back once again
2050538 this is the date that scottsdale will be aglow once again when the pink light bulbs are illuminated on the canal bridge which links the scottsdale waterfront to the southbridge district in downtown scottsdale at the vip light ceremony the pink light district
2050539 we have also been approached by several individuals wanting to support this event again this year through a deeper level of giving because of this interest we are offering an individual and corporate sponsorship program that offers many additional benefits to the supporter
2050540 100 of funds raised through all aibh fundraising efforts stay in arizona and go directly to supporting women who are dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis
2050541 you are nasty get a tissue and do it at home
2050542 construction logistics and long range hauling are all industries which continue to expand in china and internationally and which will need reliable high quality lower end trucks
2050543 the call said my account was on hold and that to reactivate it i needed to give them my information
2050544 so i gave them my information which consisted of my name my credit card number and of course my pin number
2050545 so that was about 500 which i usually dont take out that much
2050546 so i thought my bank was letting me know hey this isnt a sign this isnt what i usually do maybe its a red flag to let me know but it wasnt
2050547 as we look ahead to calendar 2009 even though it is early the slate is strong
2050548 we must continue to work toward political reconciliation to help stabilize this entire region and i discussed with president karzai a number of issues affecting afghanistan and what we must do to solve them
2050549 i hope we will be able to work constructively and productively with president karzai in the future
2050550 i am proud of our men and women in uniform and what they are doing to defend our country
2050551 their service fighting the taliban and al qaeda as well as helping the people of afghanistan is invaluable and has not gone unnoticed
2050552 the sentence was a stunning rebuke to prosecutors who had insisted on a prison term of atleast 30 years and portrayed hamdan thoroughout the trial as a hardened al queda warrior
2050553 counter allegations that the military tribunals are unfair because the rules give great lattitude to prosecutor
2050554 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
2050555 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2050556 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2050557 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2050558 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2050559 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2050560 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2050561 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2050562 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
2050563 we try to hit every memorial they have in the county and do a ceremony there we just left munising they had a nice 21 gun salute thats what were trying to do to remember our veterans those guys are the ones that gave up their lives for us
2050564 he said it was so quiet and comforting out there he could just think and sit and fish or just watch the birds and stuff
2050565 hemos puesto a los monjes en detenci n provisional y reforzado la seguridad en la embajada
2050566 he deserves whatever you give him plus 100 times more for taking a mother away from five children
2050567 i just wish she was here because lots of things have happened i wish she was here so she could help us and everything
2050568 agli emigranti veneti che con il loro lavoro e la loro opera quotidiana hanno fatto conoscere il veneto nel mondo
2050569 it puts you in this perpetual loop so your only options are to kill your browser session or be brow beaten into installing it
2050570 malicious attackers have been building so much confidence in this risk forwarding process of hosting their campaigns that they would start actively spamming the links residing within low profile legitimate sites across the web
2050571 do not download flash player from a site other than adobe com
2050572 this goes for any piece of software reader windows media player quicktime etc if you get a notice to update its not a bad idea to go directly to the site of the software vendor and download the update directly from the source if the download is from an unfamiliar url or an ip address you should be suspicious
2050573 now still in the films segment is the games business and our games business is also ramping up lego indiana jones was the top selling videogame in june and we have high hopes for lego batman as you can imagine which we are releasing in september over time we expect games to become an increasingly important part of warner brothers business
2050574 were pursuing basically two significant changes in the games business one is were going to push to establish ourselves as a third party distributor which weve already done fairly successfully in the home video business for other peoples product but its less common right now in gaming
2050575 and second we are using some felt type financing to manage the risks some of which we got for example out of abu dhabi
2050576 but what we are doing strategically is we are leveraging our own ip the titles coming out of warners
2050577 we acquired tt games which was the maker of lego indiana jones and lego star wars and batman is coming up as i mentioned we got the north american distribution rights for codemasters which is a uk based video games publisher
2050578 we have a small interest in something called brash entertainment which is a video games publisher and i mentioned we have the arrangement with our strategic partner in abu dhabi who is funding up to 250 million to co finance the development of up to 75 games over the next seven years
2050579 so theres co development there are game companies that we have different degrees of ownership in all of it focused on getting the scale and distribution and to your question of whether we have what we need in terms of human talent in our organization inside the company you know its something we work on all the time
2050580 we are developing at a pace with the size of our distribution presence and we feel that we are in reasonably good shape if you are asking whether we can attract talent that we need we think we can
2050581 infants are six to 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea four times more likely to die of pneumonia and half of all yemeni children are malnourished
2050582 there is an inappropriate amount or lack of facilities to enable mothers to breastfeed wherever they may be and there is a lack of a social support system for mothers who want to breastfed
2050583 exclusive breastfeeding contributes to the achievement of millennium development goals one and four in particular governments healthcare providers communities and families all have an important role to play
2050584 our dependence on e mail the need to attend to a constantly beeping in box is creating anxiety in the workplace adversely affecting the ability to focus diminishing productivity and threatening family bonds
2050585 i want my son and all of our children to grow up with a sense of connection to one another and to have access to the life changing lessons that nature has provided humanity since the beginning of time
2050586 we are giving those individuals 24 hours to vacate or they will be forcibly separated from the area
2050587 no its a declaration of the enforcement of the law
2050588 we have not encroached on any area we have had a presence in north cotabato for a long time
2050589 this is a careless statement by the government that could cause more problems
2050590 i have nine offers my top seven are ole miss oregon state colorado kansas state vanderbilt tulsa and new mexico right now tulsa is recruiting me the hardest they have also offered one of our ol brian deshane he s committed to them i dont know much about ole miss but they were recruiting terrell williams and told him to get in touch with me i called them and they offered i havent talked much more to their coaches but i look forward to learning more about them kansas state has offered 4 of my teammates they are the only school to do that they want us all to come and play for them oregon state has backed off because i think they got another commit who is my exact size
2050591 i went to camp at kansas state oklahoma state and the florida football showcase i saw a lot of talent at those camps
2050592 no i havent set up any visits yet i want to visit colorado oregon state and ole miss for sure terrell williams and i plan on visiting ole miss together ive been to kansas states campus a lot so i doubt ill visit there
2050593 most schools are recruiting me at wr but tulsa and oregon state want me to play wr and cb this year will be my first year to play cb
2050594 our goal is simple to have two thriving businesses delivering maximum value to customers and shareholders over the long term
2050595 the u s pharmaceutical market is in one of the worst downturns weve seen in a long time and its a prolonged one
2050596 its not surprising that cardinal as a major player in that market would be suffering
2050597 eighty percent of the problem here is the market environment is awful
2050598 weve said ok weve seen the worst and things are getting better but theyre not
2050599 the most successful part of the business really has been kind of buried
2050600 interest rates in the government securities market have recorded a considerable reduction during the early part of 2008 and have stabilized towards the middle of the year
2050601 in line with the rate reduction in the primary market the secondary market yield curve that represents the interest rate structure in the market showed a downward shift during 2008
2050602 the reduction of the interest rates in the secondary market is in the range of 130 440 basis points
2050603 there are so few countertenors today that this will be a rare opportunity to see one in performance
2050604 and brittens opera is one of the most famous countertenor roles but most companies are limited to using a contralto or female soprano so this will be a treat for bay area opera lovers
2050605 we went over every couple hours to change the bottles out
2050606 we had to reset a pole and do all kinds of work unfortunately
2050607 there is nothing that precludes a community leader or an individual from coming forward and putting their name in the hat but they have to be a member of the lnp at the time that they officially nominate
2050608 its right to cast the net broader than inside party ranks
2050609 theres an extraordinary amount of talent and capability in the general community we shouldnt be excluding those people
2050610 all we say is anyone who wants to be a candidate subscribes to the principles of the lnp and wants to represent the best interests of that party and queenslanders in parliament

2050629 i think there have been enough boobs in the white house
2050630 aint it awful if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi
2050631 i kinda feel sorry for them we should give those two a break
2050632 i cant wait to get back to america and triumph over another boxing legend
2050633 i am just glad to be blessed with the opportunity to be gods instrument that he plays his beautiful music thru and i just cant wait for the 8th
2050634 it was a sense it was just a sense that there was something near me but when i turned around and found him literally right there i was absolutely shocked
2050635 women have the best natural guard and thats intuition and if its telling you somethings not right somethings not right go back in and get a store employee to go with you and walk
2050636 the older people my generation and up may be hesitant to holler for help because their going to be so shocked at what has happened
2050637 at that point a lot of times they will back off and go in a different direction because you can identify that person
2050638 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
2050639 and my wife got there because she was at work at the shelter thats when we found out it was very very bad he was shot in the head in the chest
2050640 i got to the hospital and it was just horrible everyone was crying
2050641 i asked what happened i found out bryan was shot it just tore me up i could not believe i thought it was a nightmare
2050642 he was just a really fun loving guy always making jokes knew always how to make people laugh
2050643 always out even in the winter playing basketball laugh he was a nut
2050644 we did everything together played basketball video games sat around watched movies
2050645 what happened was a tragedy yes but god always picks the most beautiful flowers
2050646 im glad it was caught in this case but it was probably the tip of the iceberg
2050647 there are a lot of people who feel the election may have been stolen
2050648 if there was any suspicion of either fraudulent activity or just really sloppy work we terminated them and we informed the elections commission
2050649 it was obvious to us that some of them were just making up information to complete the cards
2050650 and more importantly if the application is not completed and we cant reach the person they are not going to be registered
2050651 i think weve made tremendous strides over the past three years
2050652 weve addressed all of the problems they identified in the report weve done everything we could to address all of the issues
2050653 were not afraid of high turnout were not interested in disenfranchising voters
2050654 what were afraid of is the election laws not being followed
2050655 our customers need a partner who contributes to their differentiation and supports them in reducing costs and time to market at the same time technological complexity continues to increase presenting a significant challenge thats why ebv developed into a high tech service company we know the market the products and the applications very well and provide in depth technical support and application know how through our team of 240 technical sales engineers and 120 application specialists
2050656 why is technical support so important the optimisation of time and cost starts with the idea for a new product problems and costs that arise at a later stage of a design typically start at the beginning and not at the point of buying the components based on the combination of tis standard linear and logic portfolio and the know how of ebv the first aid kit allows designers to solve problems quickly and easily in these later stages of the project this reduces customers cost and speeds time to market
2050657 ti is pleased to work with a distribution partner like ebv who knows the importance of technical support and services to help customers solve issues with challenges at the printed circuit board level
2050658 texas instruments has the right set of standard linear and logic ics that have helped customers worldwide for more than 40 years
2050659 i never get any support from my wife to do so
2050660 problems occur from time to time so that i get fade up
2050661 its a nuisance its a constant regenerated thing that goes on over and over
2050662 its something so irritating and aggravating and intrusive and abusive that youre always on guard for it
2050663 the reason the city doesnt have control over it is because its airspace and that is regulated by the department of transportation federal aviation administration
2050664 weve spotted some fires immediately after thunderstorms and headed them off weve done some search and rescue stuff with the local ems
2050665 i dont care how many flights he makes just as long as we dont have as many across us

2050667 in america our history books say that while europe was mired in the dark ages the arabs led the world in art education science math philosophy military power and you name it according to our books a thousand years ago the arabs were every bit as powerful as america is today but what our books dont tell us is what went wrong the arabs of today would be virtually unrecognizable to the arabs of the past clearly you guys suffered some tremendous catastrophe long before 1967 and long before 1948 what went wrong and when did it happen do the arabs have a name for it
2050668 the common practice of calling such motives irrational reveals how narrow the professional understanding of what matters to people has become in our day
2050669 the notion that only economic benefits power and security are rational goals is a prejudice of our time a product of the attempt to treat the world of human events as though it were the inanimate physical universe susceptible to scientific analysis and free to ignore human feelings motives and will such an approach is no more adequate to explain current behavior than to explain the actions of human beings throughout history
2050670 at the beginning of the siege there were 1 900 inhabitants of baler the number of filipino casualties after the siege was 700 with the majority presumed to be injured and the rest killed moreover the town was razed to the ground this singular act the burning of baler was to cause the physical and economic dislocation of the entire town and bring about untold hardship and suffering among the people
2050671 it had been a direct but unnecessary consequence of those stubborn ultimos de filipinas the last spanish soldiers unwilling to surrender the philippines holding siege in the church of baler their remains were never given proper burial and had been left exposed to the elements
2050672 what distressed president quezon greatly was not only that they had abandoned the bodies in utter disrespect soldiers of the katipunan were not wont to do such things he was grieving the loss of his younger brother whom he felt did not deserve to die quezon understood his father lucio was loyal to the crown of spain to the very end
2050673 historians and family agree with the description chinese mestizo lucio quezons father was of chinese ancestry and they lived in the parian or chinatown district outside intramuros his mother could have been of spanish origins because lucio spoke spanish and thus became maestro teacher in baler after retiring as a sargento in the guardia civil however he could have learned his spanish in his stint in the spanish military
2050674 quezon looked indignant glared at the man directly and without skipping a beat answered
2050675 baler is a lighthouse for many of us who are lost in the ocean
2050676 this is a mans world but it wouldnt be nothing without a woman or a girl
2050677 not of the opinion that the actual programme itself reflects a suitable input from the government of guyana we questioned the absence of our integral involvement and we would not be participating
2050678 the only thing that comes to mind about this action by the guyana government is puppy turn dag i then reflected wow its more like manish puppy i would say
2050679 ungemach droht immer wenn die fahrerlaubnisbeh rde von dem vorfall erf hrt
2050680 sie kann n mlich v llig unabh ngig vom strafverfahren zweifel an der fahreignung geltend machen und anordnen dass eine medizinisch psychologische untersuchung die gef rchtete mpu beizubringen ist
2050681 in diesen f llen bietet es sich an auf eine verfahrenseinstellung wegen geringer schuld oder gegen auflagen und weisungen hinzuarbeiten
2050682 dann wird die tat nicht ins flensburger verkehrszentralregister eingetragen und die fahrerlaubnisbeh rde erf hrt nichts davon
2050683 hier wird er sogar auf eine verurteilung seines mandanten hinarbeiten um ihn vor einer mpu zu bewahren
2050684 attestiert das gericht dem angeklagten in seinem urteil n mlich dass von ihm keine gefahr f r die verkehrsgemeinschaft ausgeht hat dies den vorteil dass die verwaltungsbeh rde an diese feststellung gebunden ist der vorteil f r den mandanten dass ihm anschlie end wegen dieser tat keine mpu mehr auferlegt werden kann wiegt den nachteil einer verurteilung f r ihn in der regel auf droht ihm doch statt eines endg ltigen verlustes seiner fahrerlaubnis h chstens noch ein zeitlich begrenztes fahrverbot
2050685 ein behutsamer umgang mit den verfolgungsbeh rden die ja ein berechtigtes interesse haben die verkehrsgemeinschaft vor ungeeigneten teilnehmern zu sch tzen kann hier h ufig noch die im alter wichtige mobilit t retten

2050691 we believe that the electoral system under the constitution is unfair and ethically divisive and there is a need to change this with the help of the commonwealth group headed by sir paul reeves we hope to bring about this change and have democracy in fiji
2050692 people of fiji have to think outside of this country and look at other nations which in turn without parliamentary rule have been able to restore democracy take a look at vietnam its a communist country yet at communal level there is democracy and people are held accountable
2050693 i can do all things through christ jesus who strengthens me
2050694 bradley was sick with a fever for 9 days and the doctors had no clues i was totally freaking out so what to do other then hop on a parent advice site i googled parenting advice i found mt at first i was like aahhh forums i hate those i like fast answers im a bit impatient at times lol i noticed it had a chat i hopped in there to see if someone could be of some help there was a few ladies in chat and they were all super nice no one had experienced a fever that long with their lil ones but they all lent their helpful hints to keep a temp down i was hooked thus the addiction to mommytalk
2050695 it is super fun the fact that the team i work with is very supportive helps me they are always there to answer questions and you know i have a lot of them i had no experience as an editor i had a lot to learn and i am still learning everyday i totally love it
2050696 if you could describe mommytalk in three words what would those three words be
2050697 one thing we have been harping on all year is about needing an indoor practice facility
2050698 we dont need one i like practicing in the gymnasium
2050699 whats scary is bad weather on the schedule for friday too its tough not being out on the field the first day you wish you were out there you could see more
2050700 the chinese people are so unhappy with the ccp and i think there is going to be a lot of voices going to try to speak out during the games
2050701 there are thousands of foreign journalists in china right now and we are hoping the media will find out what is going on behind the facade of this so called olympics of the century
2050702 i love sport im not against the olympics but the suppression and torture of the chinese people needs to stop
2050703 weve definitely come together and we had a good chat and its a team weve both decided on
2050704 were singing off the same hymn sheet here its a positive move its an aggressive move and its given the batters the responsibility to go out and get runs
2050705 ive always said the batters need to score the runs and then were going to have freddie flintoff at number six
2050706 i like fred at number six its a positive move with timmy at number seven and then broad at number eight its not a bad batting line up when you look at it like that
2050707 hes young hes fresh hes got great ideas he thinks cricket and hes got a great cricketing brain
2050708 i faced him in the nets and the ball swung for him he bowled beautifully
2050709 hes been a bit unfortunate there have been plenty of played and misses and that happens in cricket
2050710 youve just got to basically get on with it do your job not get yourself down and this is just a nice little confidence boost and to have stuart broad batting at number eight will trouble a few of their bowlers
2050711 she and balthazar met through friends and he was already separated from his wife
2050712 while the wcl tastes the sample tega has the ability to sniff it you might think wed be smart to smell something before we tasted it but frankly ive made the same mistake with sour milk a number of times
2050713 were doing this in the spirit of openness into a better understanding of how science is done thats the tradeoff of making this research public earlier than planned
2050714 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
2050715 we found high temperature release of oxygen in one and suggested this could be due to perchlorate or other possibilities that were still open
2050716 a suite of instruments that include four wet chemistry cells thermal probe at end of robotic arm and two microscopes
2050717 the basic recipe is simple we first thaw a container of soaking solution that is mostly water and dispense it in our instrumented beaker and wait awhile for all our sensors to recover from their long frozen trip to mars we then add soil and simmer it for several hours stirring frequently
2050718 throughout the measurements we monitor the 26 sensors that line the walls of the beaker
2050719 the perchlorate was discovered with a multi use sensor that also has a small sensitivity to other ions such as nitrate which is part of our calibration solution
2050720 when we got our first soil sample rosy red back on sol 30 a martian day and saw a big signal from the perchlorate sensor we naturally assumed it wasnt working properly
2050721 but we still had three more tasks to do before we were ready to make a scientific or a public announcement one was to eliminate some of the more unlikely explanations because its an unusual finding so in fact we need to entertain unlikely explanations a second was to increase our understanding of the results by discussing it in detail with colleagues a third was to verify that the result is consistent with other phoenix measurements and observations
2050722 das produkt wurde stark von us retailanlegern gekauft wir sind in dem segment nicht t tig
2050723 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
2050724 most people who teach do so because they cannot do i want to teach and prove that i can also do says john

2050726 the series covers the entire range of everything to do with dragons the cultural aspects the natural history aspects subject matter that might appeal more to adults subject matter that appeals more to children
2050727 its nothing new for us to bring in feature exhibitions
2050728 we have a couple of galleries dedicated to these travelling exhibitions that people enjoy seeing and might not see otherwise
2050729 if we talk about these mythical creatures we think oh well this is something from the past
2050730 but its alive and well in asia we see it in theatre in story telling in the art fiction these creatures are everywhere you cant dismiss it as something from the past its right here around us which i find fascinating
2050731 nowadays sales through this alternate internet channel are a must
2050732 the rapid growth of internet penetration that weve been witnessing in spain makes it imperative to implement new sales channels in order to stay competitive
2050733 there was a lot of anticipation regarding this project as it brings the lottery closer to its customers
2050734 betware has successfully completed this complex software development the games are not only up and running but offer new functionalities such as game results prize verification or favourite numbers among others
2050735 this is the largest data centre we have worked with so far
2050736 sing was the first song we plagiarised for the new album
2050737 the strokes are the classic band of our generation and i would argue for muse as well and arcade fire and thats just the boys beyonces better than all of us
2050738 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs general manager and i believe that is reciprocal
2050739 at the end of last season he promised me that if there was a good offer he would accept that i could leave
2050740 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than 8million euros
2050741 i want to leave rennes everton are offering me 1 5 million euros a year rennes could never offer me that much
2050742 i owe everything to rennes my formative club but they must understand me in africa i have a family to feed and i am very ambitious
2050743 everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters
2050744 this is not an anti titan movement were not getting involved in that we just dont think thats the appropriate spot for it
2050745 we own property all over the u s its not just necessary for building a facility or mining lots of time we look for property to do restoration or mitigation or things of that sort we look for all possibilities
2050746 with everything thats happening in new hanover county with this ordeal im going to have a lot of questions im not extending an invitation to titan
2050747 since launching on veterans day 2006 interest has remained high for the little caesars veterans program currently more than 30 veterans have been approved to become little caesars franchisees and more than 2 000 inquiries have been made about the program several more
2050748 warning long post my rant against authors who keep shoving the same sociopathic clones down my throat
2050749 damn that was way too much thinking on half a cup of coffee
2050750 i liked blah blah without giving us the i hated this part
2050751 each time we dont have water or telephone service i know because the grass has been cut
2050752 its real bad you cant take a bath because it takes an hour just to run a tub or water its hard
2050753 we just had a 1100 water bill if this ran from 8am monday morning to 7pm monday night theres no telling what our water bill is gonna be
2050754 if you cant come out and help us repair it dont cut it
2050755 it really is not any different than already taking fingerprints at the time of arrest its just one more piece of evidence that the justice system could use
2050756 we would not only know conclusively who you are as with a fingerprint but we could also know if there was any crimes in the country you may be suspected of having committed and we wouldnt inadvertently let you back into society
2050757 just because we have the technology that doesnt mean we should be throwing away the constitutional protections that keep us a free society
2050758 there are not enough safeguards for the procedures for collection analysis and identification using dna
2050759 my father was someone who just couldnt resist a bargain
2050760 when he first bought it you could be in the basement and look at the sky
2050761 the longest weve ever stayed here is the first of december
2050762 lately we havent even been putting bait in the pots
2050763 rather than go to bed ill take some eels and go bass fishing
2050764 gt un obicei stravechi nu stiu cat tine el de traditiile scenei si cat de naravurile locului face ca desi se intampla sa treaca si cate o luna intreaga fara premiere mai ales in timpul iernii cu doua trei saptamani inainte de inchiderea stagiunii tocmai cand caldura incepe sa devina apasatoare teatrele sa scoata unul dupa altul si una dupa alta noutatile

2050766 so many of our rivals will arrive with a distinct advantage but we are certainly prepared for the challenge because we want to compete at the highest level
2050767 linking up with the uns carbon credit registry will further strengthen europes leading role in the global carbon market
2050768 we are negotiating with the united nations to decide the exact date
2050769 if we lost anywhere from two to five minutes thats potentially five to 10 points you could get on the test
2050770 if i were a person who did not pass and it was by five points and i was in a room that got a five minute disruption from the earthquake i would definitely protest it i would definitely make it an issue
2050771 its the first time ive seen two kids playing catch in 20 years so i stopped the car and gave them each an autographed ball
2050772 i said im so proud that you two kids are out there playing catch because nobody does anything today unless its organized
2050773 i kind of shocked them a little bit but i was just in awe of that because you dont see it any more
2050774 sure you did old man now take your liniment smell and get out of here before i have to call the police oh and thanks for now ruining my baseball by scribbling all over it
2050775 found that girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests
2050776 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
2050777 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
2050778 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
2050779 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
2050780 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
2050781 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements
2050782 three weeks ago saudi arabia hosted an interfaith conference in madrid spain during the conference that took place from july 16 19 king abdullah of saudi arabia called for reconciliation among various religions
2050783 plagiarism and legal scholarship in the age of information sharing the need for intellectual honesty
2050784 while not usually viewed as scholarship professors often develop teaching materials for use by their students such as study guides assignments quizzes and tests
2050785 my goal in this book was really to help all of us just think the church isnt just a business
2050786 i want us to realize that ambition is not bad however ambition with no foundation will lead you to a bad place
2050787 james gleick is the author most recently of isaac newton he is working on a history of information
2050788 it changes the dynamic and think i miss the old days
2050789 its like going around behind people and picking up the trash
2050790 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2050791 while many websites cover medal tallies and country standings we turn our cameras 180 degrees to show national pride fan support and local color along with great sports photography
2050792 we want to provide a sense of what its like to be at the games through pictures and personal stories direct from beijing
2050793 we are currently reviewing newly produced samples of a more traditional fit we are adding a female type fit in the work apparel style we are not a fashion statement jean we are just a good ole comfortable fitting and durable jean
2050794 how americans can buy american the power of consumer patriotism
2050795 an excellent example of a group blog a true community of like minded but highly individual writers topics range from the state of christian publishing to craft issues to lyrical meditations on writing as a spiritual discipline
2050796 i was trained at drama school and when i got into films i stayed there for longer than i planned
2050797 but when i made my theatrical debut at the age of 50 i knew i wanted to do more
2050798 it was one of the most enjoyable things ive done
2050799 but it did nothing for my career because people thought it was all i could do
2050800 not the kind youre thinking i married very young peter had a major heart attack not long afterwards and we lived a quiet life in the country so i think the sixties youre talking about rather passed me by
2050801 ah well yes we lived a life that would be shocking today the excess the jetsetting the polluting lifestyle i see life differently now
2050802 oh no it has been a very interesting process and in no way am i upset
2050803 i saw pictures of myself at 20 and even i was stunned i looked young and blonde and i can quite see how peter would fall for me
2050804 no i think regretting things creates bitterness and i am not a bitter person i think you learn from things and move on anyone who knows me will know my philosophy is get on with it
2050805 people keep telling me that i am this that or the other and i think what do they mean much of what has been written doesnt feel like it was me
2050806 i love being on stage i love the attention and the fact that people are focused on me
2050807 a gentle stroll through my life just me talking about the way it was
2050808 my show comes down at 7 30pm so thats a little early to start socialising
2050809 i am disappointed and surprised that the broadcasters are advocating an approach that would not and could not lead to serious substantive and enforceable terms of trade agreements
2050810 the reality is that all of us are facing significant time pressures to reach an agreement
2050811 the crtc expects each broadcast group to have concluded an agreement with the cftpa in time for the submission of their licence renewal applications which will likely be due later this year this means that we need to be engaged in real substantive bargaining throughout the fall
2050812 robust and reusable standards are the most effective solution for both those business issues
2050813 because opentravels standards are so widely adopted we can now forge new commercial partnerships with enhanced distribution of our products and services the ability to generate ancillary revenues through channels beyond our own website is key to our distribution strategy
2050814 i think cody first and foremost needs to take care of the ball a lot better this fall than we did last fall
2050815 i take a big chunk of that too and we had a big emphasis on that this spring and he did a great job of taking care of the ball
2050816 he just has to not play tentative by any means but when something is there to be had take it and when its not move on to your next option or whatever the case may be
2050817 cody in the summer did a good job of kind of spearheading everything and getting the young guys involved and getting them to learn things and that makes their learning curve a little less steep as we get going
2050818 those guys are playing faster than we ever have here and that has to come from hopefully your quarterback leading that charge in the offseason and hes done a nice job were way ahead of where weve been
2050819 as a quarterback if you know your job lock stock and barrel and then just bring everybody else along and show he knows their jobs too that gets everyone rolling along in the same direction
2050820 this year being able to come in with this new stable of talent and being the starting quarterback i think im very comfortable with the offense and im understanding things a lot more
2050821 im really learning to play within myself and let the game come to me rather than trying to force so many plays
2050822 when youre in high school and youre playing youre used to having your way with stuff but in a conference like the big 12 and when you play against so much tough competition in teams and athletes you definitely have to be on top of your game i think ive learned that

2050837 he said it as a big decision but he believes i need to go and play its no good sitting in the stands its a big step but i believe its a step in the right direction i was very impressed with owen coyle and im just looking forward to playing regularly
2050838 ive been talking about giving it up next year but i dont know what will happen well see how my body feels your body can only take you so far and im about using my strength and running and when you get older that takes its toll

2050862 our society doesnt let children experience the wonders of nature and the environment
2050863 that would be one of the easiest ways to eliminate somebody would be to get a voluntary dna sample
2050864 i think if it helps narrow it down and help find the guy who raped the girl im all for it you know

2050868 scammers capitalize on that so we have scammers who will become a member of a church so that way they can become a trusted member and scam all the people in the church
2050869 it was pretty sloppy i think we had nine offensive penalties which was no good
2050870 we have to go back and look statistics are statistics and when you play yourself you dont know whos in there and whos doing what
2050871 weve added some credence to it but its not a catch all end all to what theyve done
2050872 even though we stopped the ball a little better we still have to run the ball better on offense
2050873 we kind of stopped the run but we still missed too many tackles and weve got to get that taken care of
2050874 were still in school we still have to take exams next monday and tuesday this isnt like a normal camp were still feeling our way through this thing right now

2050876 kekhuatiran kami ialah mengenai cara konflik itu ditangani perlu ada usaha terancang oleh kerajaan untuk menangani isu ini dengan bersungguh sungguh dan bukan secara berpura pura sahaja
2050877 i mean this is essentially agriculture right but the people i talk to especially the ones coming out of business school this is the one hot area everyone wants to get into
2050878 all of us here everyone in this company and in this industry are aware of the urgency
2050879 i always start my day with the daily whackjob and any other blogs i read are because ive followed links from there
2050880 unfortunately as a result of the bombardment about 30 people mainly military men are dead
2050881 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset
2050882 our mobilator shows people just how much their mobile content is worth for many people mobiles are an extension of their daily lives with personal memories once in a lifetime contact details and the odd sexy text holding huge importance putting a cash value on it all seemed the best way to highlight the value of peoples mobile lives the one thing the mobilator cant put a pound sign on is the emotional attachment to your personal content so the message is clear you should protect what is valuable to you
2050883 if you lose your data then often the loss for the individual is much more than the value of the handset itself in most cases the information lost on a mobile is hardly ever retrieved if a handset is stolen the data loss has proven to be the biggest inconvenience and trauma during a theft as you never know who has your details this takes us into the realm of id theft and fraud
2050884 we noticed the new york plates when it was parked kind of in front of us and i seen him walk by and i said man that looks like paul mccartney

2050897 when you see whats happened in downtown marquette and the number of projects that we have worked with the city on in a partnership we realized that these are good investments paying good returns and thats why we keep making them in marquette
2050898 we are really satisfied with the resolution of the tribunal as they have accepted the position of barcelona
2050899 we had the right to decide whether to release the player to the argentine national team we have now set a precedent which is very important to the football clubs
2050900 we now have to evaluate the satiation to see what is best for barcelona and the player and we have to think what is best for argentina and we will soon make a decision
2050901 when you come in at 500 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
2050902 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2050903 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2050904 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2050905 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2050906 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2050907 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school
2050908 a lot of them have told me im glad ive got the hour drive it gives them that whole amount of time to leave it behind
2050909 they get in their bus or car and they go into a zone they say for the next hour im decompressing im getting re engaged into what its like to be a civilian
2050910 you never know what is around the corner in some ways i was disappointed i wasnt thought of as a possible test captain
2050911 but once the selectors decided they wanted to unify the jobs then i probably was a bit of a non starter
2050912 you never know there may be opportunities in the future you never say never and it is something id still like to do again
2050913 i think ive still got unfinished business with the captaincy to be honest i feel i could have done the test job and made a pretty good fist of it and would have benefited a lot from the time i had in charge previously
2050914 the most important thing from my point of view is there is no point in me feeling sorry for myself the most important thing is that i get behind kevin and help him out
2050915 the issue is the england team going forward and the senior players getting behind kevin in what is going to be a bit of a learning curve for him and we need to support him as much as we can
2050916 ive already spoken to kevin about the job and he is going to need some senior players around him through those first days and weeks
2050917 we had a chat about what the job entails and i felt was best to do things
2050918 but you have got to be your own person there is no point in kevin trying to be like michael vaughan or mike atherton or mike brearley he has got to be like kevin pietersen
2050919 sometimes you have got to smooth off your edges and tiptoe around people a little bit but fundamentally youve got to be yourself
2050920 you have to take your gut decisions because you are responsible for that happens
2050921 i am sure kevin will do that he has got a very good cricketing brain and he is going to thrust himself into the job wholeheartedly
2050922 that is the way he has played his cricket and i am sure his captaincy will be no different
2050923 we are seeing a number of common types of cyberbullying quite regularly

2050929 how is the direct quote from one of pelosis people reflective of a
2050930 we do not have any third country agreement with china so yes any duty free liquids will taken off any passengers returning from the olympics and destroyed
2050931 the agreement with croatia is just a drop in the ocean
2050932 the problems that will be faced by transfer passengers arriving in the eu from china during the olympics is symptomatic of a much broader problem
2050933 growing the list of countries with eu recognition agreement needs to become an immediate priority as several applications for such agreements are still outstanding
2050934 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it

2050937 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2050938 i feel a lot more relaxed in the job in terms of being myself
2050939 i feel more comfortable with everything that is around me and i have matured into the job nicely
2050940 i think about things a lot more now and am far less impulsive than i used to be i have settled down a lot
2050941 the other bonus is i really feel like this team is my team i feel like i have developed it got youngsters in that i felt could benefit the team
2050942 it is a wonderful feeling when you get success when you have taken certain risky decisions backed certain players and they have started to come through for you is a wonderful feeling
2050943 there have been times in my captaincy when i have thought this is a tough job how long can you do this it certainly has gone through my mind
2050944 i was very young when i took the job on so there were going to be a lot of ups and downs for me there were going to be the big highs and the big lows and i was going to make mistakes
2050945 michael vaughan probably got to his finished article a lot quicker than i got there in terms of the team he wanted the way the team was playing
2050946 i feel like i have been getting there in the last year and a half but there is a shelf life and i would love to develop someone to take over
2050947 if there is someone to take over your job then you leave the team in a better place it makes you feel a lot better walking away
2050948 i dont want to think too far away i like to meet each challenge as it comes along and i have a future plan on where i would like to take this team
2050949 i see a role of me doing that at some stage in my career to captain for 10 years is a long time i would like to do that at some stage

2051028 its still an increase and were appreciative of that but at the same time that small revenue increase of about one percent or so is eaten up very quickly
2051029 the natural gas and diesel fuel would just about eat up all of that increase
2051030 its not going to fix the problems the funding increase were getting today is less than inflation so schools have major reductions to make another year in a row here
2051031 you will only be able to buy it at shows or directly through our web site we can do it ourselves make all the cash to fund everything we need to do
2051032 they could reach out into the community just leaving it the way it is
2051033 i dont see how changing the name of a street is going to help their community outreach efforts whatsoever
2051034 we are gratified by the overwhelming response weve received so far throughout the continent and beyond
2051035 with registration nearly double that of this time last year we believe this underscores the urgent need for strategic it planning in organizations focused on successfully managing business and it transformation
2051036 if its not true hes got to stand up and say this is not true

2051038 i credit katie and troy for sticking with it in a difficult situation
2051039 keith was chomping at the bit the whole time because he wanted to be with his teammates hes thrilled both sides were definitely motivated
2051040 brandon johnson is a candidate to be one of the three best
2051041 practice is everything even the first meeting is missing too much time
2051042 but at this level its a business and you have to let things run its course
2051043 it is our opinion and contention that to spend any more money trying to upgrade the existing facility that is currently condemned would be throwing good money after bad and would be an unwise and short sighted use of the taxpayers money
2051044 once that occurs and lets say its decided to rebuild of course its got to be decided where funding is going to come from
2051045 and because the jfk kids are in a double session its not really considered an emergency
2051046 based on what i seen so far it shows promise nothing really pops out as a problem to be concerned with
2051047 as far as ive seen right now its more than adequate
2051048 one of the considerations that we have is if we were to move away from the property we are walking away from millions of dollars of still perfectly usable facilities this proposal incorporates those existing facilities and i think that is a great advantage
2051049 you just come out and do a quick survey on the computer you do a little mini physical with blood pressure and stuff and sit in a chair and read a book for five to ten minutes

2051067 it was the hardest decision of my career and im suffering a lot to have to let go of my dream juliana said in a statement released by her management company and translated from portuguese
2051068 we fought during four years to get to the olympics and i wont be able to be by larissa on the court
2051069 juliana had a very courageous and noble act larissa said
2051070 its not easy to make this decision after so many days of suffering and sacrifice im sorry that she is not in condition to be by my side in this moment that we had dreamed so much for our careers
2051071 i tried everything grabbed all the possibilities given to me by the professionals who evaluated me but unfortunately i reached my limit juliana said
2051072 we knew that this could have happened but we always worked with the expectation that i would play
2051073 there was no more time for doubts and the decision had to me mine she said
2051074 i thought a lot about it and realized that it wouldnt be fair to larissa the technical staff and the brazilian people for me to play without the ideal conditions to do well in the olympics
2051075 i know some people may question why i didnt make this decision earlier juliana said
2051076 but i ask would someone give up their dream this easily without fighting until the last minute

2051084 within an eight hour day you are entitled to take a break in the morning and in the afternoon its a benefit to everyone especially co workers you can get pretty crabby
2051085 you try to lay back and be nice to employees
2051086 we just followed the law i dont know how an employer could allow a person who smokes to take breaks and not give that same benefit to another employee even if the law allowed that you know there would be hard feelings
2051087 a group of american cyclists are apologizing to beijing olympic organizers after arriving in china s capital wearing face masks jim scherr the u s olympic committee s chief executive officer says the athletes regret their actions and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
2051088 i swung down and happened to hit his head i was intending to get away from him
2051089 you never attempted to strike the hand that was reaching for the gun
2051090 the fight seemed like it lasted forever but it was very dynamic and quick
2051091 did he just drop you or slam you to the ground
2051092 i just fell to the ground and he ended up on top of me
2051093 being on the ground is the biggest concern you could ever have
2051094 after what he said and after the fight everybody in their right mind would have been afraid i was afraid he was gonna get the gun and kill me

2051098 the united nations mission in sudan unmis has concerns that the judicial process may not have met international standards
2051099 unmis is concerned that the judicial process under the anti terrorist act only allows for an extremely limited appellate process
2051100 unmis accordingly urges the appeal court to thoroughly review the 30 death sentences
2051101 unmis also encourages sudan to abolish capital punishment and in the meantime establish a moratorium on executions

2051107 they mvp athletes all gave their full commitments and turned up for training on tuesday morning and participated at the required pace
2051108 there is absolutely no truth to the allegations that mr stephen francis will not be able to coach the athletes at the olympics under his care unless he has taken that decision not to coach his own athletes
2051109 mr stephen francis had long indicated to the jamaica amateur athletic association past and present that he does not wish to be a part of the national teams coaching staff
2051110 we want to continue to be as self sufficient as possible
2051111 but with the extra variable costs we need to have a 5t ha 2t acre crop to break even with barley at 120 t
2051112 at 72 t delivered which is what weve bought extra straw in at that is worth at least half a tonne of grain
2051113 we fear prices will go up more if the rain continues growers will struggle with quality also with the price of fertiliser more arable producers are chopping straw to make the most of its residual value
2051114 everything is looking good the longer term worry is whether the quality will be affected if the rain continues and whether grass weeds will proliferate and increase the crops moisture content
2051115 our costs of growing winter barley this year were 482 ha 195 acre and we bought our fertiliser early with the increase in fertiliser prices and other costs im not sure it still stacks up
2051116 it is going to be serious if it goes ahead it is vitally important that we fight the eus plans
2051117 i bought that in may weve never been tempted to buy so far forward before as its a big commitment at a time of year with lower sales however it has already produced a saving of 2000 as prices have risen
2051118 that is more than a 1 kg drop in just eight weeks from the first draw to the last
2051119 it seems bizarre that our processor retailers are playing games of crashing the price beyond seasonality just when we need the confidence to commit to producing for next season
2051120 i got a text message off kevin last night to say welcome back and good luck
2051121 i just said to him it felt like christmas eve i was so excited for the game
2051122 god only knows how kev felt going into his first game as england captain but i was just pleased to be back
2051123 it wasnt too bad it was better than i thought it was going to be it was excitement more than nerves i think but i have bowled nearly 500 overs this year so it was a case of running in and trusting my ability
2051124 to be honest the first ball was not a good ball it was a short wide long hop which he smacked straight to gully it wasnt as if it was top of off hed nicked and it had been dropped
2051125 i never get too upset about dropped catches it is one of those things people dont do it on purpose it would have been nice but it is about england
2051126 today england as a team were fantastic there were 11 leaders out there
2051127 kevin did a fantastic job i thought he was brilliant as captain he didnt get challenged that much because a lot of things he did went right for him and the things we did went right for us
2051128 it is not a knock on county cricket but you dont get that in county cricket
2051129 you might get that once every six weeks when you get a top top player out but when there are 18 000 in the ground and there is an atmosphere a buzz that is what i have missed
2051130 thats why i was never ever going to go away i was never letting my test career go
2051131 pace has its benefits but if you dont hit the areas youre in trouble
2051132 i think its a mixture of pace and hitting the areas and causing pressure
2051133 its unfortunate that most of us batters got out to adequate deliveries or loose shots
2051134 weve been in this situation before at lords and hopefully in the second innings we can dig deep and recover some of that
2051135 the series is won but were playing for our country and a lot of pride goes into that
2051136 it will be experience versus youth in two of the biggest fights of the year
2051137 the boxing world is on notice for oct 11 and we are thrilled to deliver both landmark events in one blockbuster telecast on showtime i give special thanks to these four world class fighters for taking the important fight at the right time
2051138 i want to send vitali back into retirement and then end his brother s reign as champion
2051139 i will become the first fighter to end an entire family s boxing career everyone is going down the heavyweight division is mine
2051140 i am injury free and ready to take my title back
2051141 my brother wladimir and i have had a long time goal of being heavyweight champions at the same time that dream will be realized when i take back what is rightfully mine the wbc heavyweight title the next step will be holding all of the heavyweight belts with wladimir
2051142 its a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain as if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
2051143 ich h rte einen lauten knall und kann mich danach an nichts mehr erinnern
2051144 der lokf hrer hat alles getan was er konnte um den zug zu stoppen

2051149 oh well today was a civic holiday in our region however when we got up it was raining so we knew that the holiday would be postponed
2051150 tomorrow if it is raining we will come to work again but if it is nice then we will take the holiday
2051151 the last time i got a reporting from fleet operations which was within the last two weeks we were within four cars of having enough cars to do that
2051152 when they take that home and it sits in their driveway it provides a visual that there are police in the area
2051153 all the indications were from them to us that there was not any additional cars needed
2051154 it was the assignment of the car that sits there
2051155 some of those cars were left parked in what we felt were unsecure locations
2051156 its not a risk were willing to take with our equipment any more
2051157 unlike when i did it for fun and to play with new technologies
2051158 were seeing an unprecedented movement to steal peoples entire life savings which is causing real pain and suffering now im able to help curb and hopefully minimize this and im looking forward to working with the right team to maximize these efforts
2051159 kevin has amazing potential as a brand or for promoting others hes like tiger woods is to golf gene simmons is to rock and dog chapman is to bounty hunting hes iconic
2051160 weve all been waiting for the ban to be lifted and book deal to be signed and now that it is we are moving forward on all fronts were now accepting inquiries from all interested parties that wish to capitalize on such a unique offering and the media attention

2051164 this is a club that should be in the top two tiers of english football
2051165 i believe this club in the next few years will start climbing the leagues starting this year
2051166 we need to put last season behind us and it is good to have some fresh players in to help us kick on
2051167 we have got players that have played at a higher level been promoted and won things and are still hungry for success
2051168 for a player to turn around and refuse his final pay packet and instead ask to sponsor a youth player is unheard of this shows the type of man that don is and what football means to him
2051169 we have been through a lot of change and we cant expect to be the finished article but we can be optimistic after doing what weve done within the budget
2051170 im sure everybody who begins life in league two will have the same expectations as us and be just as determined but lets see how we start off and let us also suss out whats in this division
2051171 rotherhams got its club back and im going to make sure that we do our level best every game is going to be like a cup final

2051185 with china hosting the olympic games chinese culture and history are definitely more in the spotlight than ever before it is wonderful to see that the great wall remains a firm favorite especially the badaling section which draws around 10 million visitors a year
2051186 the sony optical disc system is in use throughout the stations field and studio operations and the benefit has been streamlined production and a reduction in the time between capturing and editing footage and getting it to air
2051187 using this system we were able to achieve effects and capture shots that we previously would have thought impossible for a station with our budget constraints
2051188 the xdcam technology makes everything so easy and elevates our production capabilities to an entirely new level
2051189 the main problem weve had with these signs is that theyre very hard to communicate with the technology is old the software is old and theyre constantly having failures
2051190 we would have substituted portable message boards we have several portable message boards in our district that we use specifically for hurricane evacuations
2051191 its old technology versus new technology and this new technology were going to put up is really going to solve those problems and perform the way really the motorists and we want em to perform

2051238 this has no effect on mr kaplans defense and we understand why the lenis family would feel compelled to enter their pleas

2051241 we saw a picture of a dead body in there of course we turned that over to investigators
2051242 after four days id say im very encouraged with how hard hes practicing
2051243 he has some young guys breathing down his neck right now he knows that
2051244 with quarterback rodney landers he really distributes the ball a lot to a lot of different receivers and gets everybody the ball
2051245 its not like he has one guy he always goes to
2051246 the big thing about charlie he doesnt make the big mistake on offense
2051247 hes always in the right spot after four days hes practicing with a lot of confidence because hes an older player catching the ball in the crowd blocking better
2051248 once we get closer to game time well be putting stuff in we change each week depending on the defense
2051249 i love it i love having different roles its fun it doesnt get old at all
2051250 i didnt think i could gain the weight to be it
2051251 the coaches are phenomenal they know what you can do and what you cant do

2051254 in order to have a competition we absolutely have to have a live auction to make this realistic when i contacted the tourism bureau and told them what we had in mind surprising to us we didnt know we were going to be selling things out of the becky thatcher house
2051255 since we could not see no use in the foreseeable future the thought instead of placing them in storage to offer them so people could enjoy them in your homes and businesses

2051257 by contributing funds to purchase a restrictive use easement on this property the navy is helping to protect the agricultural and historical values that have contributed so much to fallons heritage and frontier spirit
2051258 preserving working ranches is a key element of the conservancys land protection goals in the case of this property we are fortunate to work with a family who cares so passionately for their land and the surrounding community

2051263 the first pictures i saw of him when he didnt have any glasses on didnt look anything like him

2051266 its getting better some people are scared to come to this side of town but theres nothing wrong with it weve got a lot of people who are close knit

2051281 i asked the band director can i direct and he let me direct the band

2051287 at the draft in april shanahan asked me how i felt about playing fullback
2051288 it will be interesting to see how much difference selling ones own high margin beer products can make in leased sites
2051289 they havent gone down at all the markets slow but its slow everywhere
2051290 were still getting the asking price on every house we sell
2051291 there are plenty of little ghost towns west of parkes that didnt have anything like this
2051292 if they want to be teachers fine ill hire them back as teachers
2051293 kids used to be taught to be proud to be american but now theyre taught that everyone else is better than them
2051294 i bet theyre even taught gays are cooler than straight people
2051295 i really think people care about education just right now theyre skeptical and theyre broke
2051296 we need to win back the trust and respect of dissatisfied parents and tax payers
2051297 with the school system being the biggest bureaucracy in washoe county we want to make sure were doing things right
2051298 i certainly dont have all the answers but i have enough experience to put policy deliberations into context
2051299 the unemployment rate continues to rise which is a sign the labour market is really starting to ease given that the economy continues to struggle we think were going to see further weakness in the labour market over the second half of this year
2051300 that was a case that if there was a bylaw in place that person would be restricted from that location
2051301 the fact is the object of the bylaw is to provide protection for where children or the elderly will be most likely gathering
2051302 it would give the police another tool if we had a level 3 sex offender near a bus stop or a school
2051303 this creates an opportunity an invitation almost to target certain areas of town
2051304 what is the effect on those people who are old young or mentally challenged who live in that area

2051307 we have citizens that are in fear of our own police department
2051308 i can confirm that the ioc has taken action against what was in our view a serious breach of the news access rules the nine network enr crew will not be issued olympic green common domain filming passes and will not be permitted to enter the olympic green common domain with equipment this sanction is effective immediately and will end at 2400hrs on august 13
2051309 my host family was great there were five sisters and the mom and dad
2051310 they welcomed me into their home and treated me like one of their own
2051311 amigos broadened my understanding of what is possible and how things work it was challenging and rewarding
2051312 i love to share photos of my trips with other people so that they can get a taste of what my experience was like
2051313 non esiste una preparazione uguale per tutti i delegati alla convention ognuno fa come crede e ha i propri metodi generalmente comunque si tende ad approfondire i temi maggiori della politica del proprio partito
2051314 spero che gli americani lo capiscano considerato il calo del consenso verso obama ammetto di essere spaventato allidea di perdere nuovamente le elezioni ma sono convinto che con il nostro programma elettorale riusciremo a convincere tutti
2051315 i went to bed on wednesday night thinking about my career options but when i woke up thursday morning i was convinced i wanted to stay with my guys at agr
2051316 i decided to stay with agr and 7 eleven and its a good contract that should be my last one in indy cars
2051317 i talked to him on wednesday night and he said we were fine we were great and were a go
2051318 our mortgage production segment continued to be negatively impacted by market pressures as rising interest rates during the quarter significantly slowed new mortgage application activity especially refinance volume
2051319 as a result of mortgage rates rising more than 50 basis points since the end of the first quarter our current expectation is that we will not achieve our 39 billion target for originations for the full year of 2008
2051320 the extreme volatility in the mortgage production environment has caused private label prospects to consider outsourcing to a greater degree we entered into three new outsourcing arrangements since march 31 2008 and dialogue continues with other potential clients
2051321 during the quarter our fleet management services segment continued to be challenged by the effects of the announcement of the merger transaction as well as an increase in the total cost of funds associated with our vehicle management asset backed debt we have made good progress in both signing new accounts and building a pipeline of new business retention of existing business has returned to pre merger announcement levels and we believe we are gaining momentum in the marketplace
2051322 there is no such thing as the mayor of marina i happened to be one of the first to invest in a holiday home in this stretch of the mediterranean coast west of alexandria and i do happen to know a lot about its earliest beginnings and newcomers came to me for advice
2051323 these days you do not have to be a millionaire to own a descent villa with a swimming pool overlooking the mediterranean
2051324 the extremely wealthy prefer to spend their vacations in europe they have the money to do so but that does not mean that they will not invest in a lavish mansion on the north coast
2051325 sidi bishr alexandria used to be the haunt of the wealthy today the seriously rich are moving further west along the mediterranean coast
2051326 the government for instance constructs an airport with scheduled domestic and international flights in marsa alam or in alamein and property prices in the area soars this is how new tourism destinations are created and sooner or later integrated communities are founded
2051327 we do not focus narrowly on exclusive private residential projects
2051328 palm hills is expanding its real estate projects to merge residential housing with the tourism industry of the north coast
2051329 all year round tourism international tourism selling egypt as an attractive tourism destination that is also our goal
2051330 egypt made the biggest worldwide leap in economic freedom over the last year gaining four percentage points the largest improvement of any country
2051331 the new real estate boom along the red sea and mediterranean north coast resorts are designed to let you relax unwind and feel free and refreshed most are close to entertainment and shopping malls
2051332 few egyptians have faith in the stock exchange and they find it far sounder to invest in property and real estate there is a surplus in national savings and possessing a holiday home by the seaside is not only a mark of social distinction but a lucrative investment moreover the banking system is not as developed as in some other oil rich gulf arab or western countries
2051333 there is also the natural tendency towards the maximisation of profits
2051334 there are those who prefer to sell properties to foreigners to a british national for example who would pay in pound sterling instead of doing business with a local client
2051335 there are properties with private beaches unheard of in many western countries with special health spas gymnasiums and other such facilities some of the best bargains are being sold like hotcakes to foreigners who seek sun sea and sand
2051336 i think its really important that you dont underestimate the knowledge base of the consumer what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
2051337 weve seen some research that says 60 per cent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again
2051338 and at the end of the day that comes back down to creativity
2051339 weve seen some research that says 60 per cent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again
2051340 he was not one of those people that everyone loves
2051341 its a little bit different but its an emphasis that we feel as if we need and we want to make sure we get deep into our special teams from a concept standpoint so they understand how important they are
2051342 the guys that really caught my eye in the spring in the kick off returns were brandon saine and boom herron
2051343 those two guys did a great job bringing it up
2051344 im anticipating that hes going to be a guy with a passion to learn and thats the only thing that holds out people is can you learn what we are doing
2051345 hes a great kid and hes trained hard and hes nervous like any other freshman and im sure he didnt sleep last night
2051346 hes ready to go he had wrist surgery which was the major issue but hes ready to go
2051347 now are we gonna tackle him 600 times this summer no probably because we cant because it wouldnt be smart
2051348 hes going through some things right now and hes got to go through some hurdles but doug is a good kid
2051349 they have the good things you need to handle all the adversity and distraction along the way im excited to watch them come together as a team
2051350 the belief that thats additional money above and beyond what we would normally get thats the part thats not true
2051351 well its certainly one of the worst votes i ever made
2051352 the lottery becomes part of the big pot of money that funds the basic functions of state government
2051353 when the trade papers actually came and i was going to sign them which would be my job i almost wanted someone else to sign
2051354 i dont think anybody would be comfortable with that this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to at the end of the day though i think all parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation hopefully we can do things going forward that maybe people will not remember that but the answer to your question is no
2051355 i feel like we did the best we could for the packers given the circumstances
2051356 quite frankly most of the time youre sitting around waiting
2051357 the real conversations were going on between the teams and brett
2051358 were just going to take things one year at a time
2051359 were excited to have brett on the team for this year
2051360 i know as an organization we have taken hits and it has split our fans
2051361 but it is important as we look to the future that we come together
2051362 i went down there trying to help brett out of a situation and to help us out of a situation i entered into discussions of a very private nature and i thought they were sincere that this was a way to help both sides get out of a very difficult situation
2051363 obviously as i look back on it i would do things differently
2051364 never really got to that spot because of where brett was at as far as everything that had happened
2051365 i was just looking for him to tell me that he was ready to play for the green bay packers and if we would have gotten to that point then our conversation would have continued
2051366 and it did not get to that point and thats the facts
2051367 he was going to have the opportunity to compete for his spot
2051368 it wasnt bretts fault and it wasnt our fault but the relationship got to a point where it couldnt go forward
2051369 dont try to blame either side its like a marriage that ends it happens neither party is at fault but you move forward
2051370 ultimately he decided he wanted to play but not for green bay
2051371 this is a high risk business this is the national football league we understand that when we sign on
2051372 i think our job is to do what we try to do every day do the very best we can to put this team in a position to win games and to represent this community and this state and all the packer fans around the country well thats all you can do is try to do your job and do it well
2051373 to a certain degree i dont really know what im getting into
2051374 but im here for one reason not to do commercials and broadway and all those things im here to help the jets win and thats why they got me
2051375 yeah green bays a small market but is there a bigger team i dont know
2051376 ive been in big games won big games lost big games had my share of criticism and glory but this is unique i havent faced anything like this
2051377 look i havent played in new york for a full season im a south mississippi boy
2051378 i know how tough it can be and i know how great it can be
2051379 am i ready to face it handle it deal with it i think so
2051380 i had so many people saying you look like you had a lot of fun out there this year and i did but what they dont see is thats only three hours during the course of a week
2051381 i know i expect a lot out of myself and certain things are expected of me within this organization and i tried to live up to those all the time and brett favre got hard to live up to
2051382 did i ever think this scenario would present itself no
2051383 this whole offseason has been bizarre but it is what it is im a member of the jets im excited about it and excited about the opportunity
2051384 i had forgotten that i had been traded 17 years ago and what that process was like its a little bit different scenario now
2051385 but im really excited this is refreshing not that i needed that
2051386 im not a traitor never will be its business thats the way it works i gave everything i could possibly give while i was there and i dont think people would question that and i hope that the jets fans see the same thing
2051387 sad to see brett favres career as a packer end
2051388 do want to have a long term relationship with brett
2051389 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot id love to see him have the time of his life im wishing him well i think all football fans want to see him do well and we pray he will
2051390 wants to come back here he wants to be welcome back here
2051391 talked about him coming back when he does retire and working training camp just something so he can be part of it i told him he can help with the quarterbacks but i dont want any new plays
2051392 the things that happened there this offseason in my opinion are over and done with i wish them well ill use their term were moving forward
2051393 im not going to sit here and blame it all one side or the other a lot of things happened this offseason a lot of shocking things i think were both at fault whos at fault more its a matter of opinion but i really think at this point its irrelevant
2051394 i know its great for the media its a great soap opera but that does nothing for the guys in this locker room or for the coaches and it does nothing for the guys in green bay that team is going to be good with or without me and it really serves no purpose to continue talking about it
2051395 once again im here for one reason and thats to help the jets win at some point it has to be let go
2051396 it is so remarkable what the administrators teachers and staff have done
2051397 they dont talk particulars until they talk to the board
2051398 well be at the same percentage this coming year and last year and then it jumps up again
2051399 it is a time when we must be extra careful about safety and we should not draw easy conclusions
2051400 when they pull down the gates in their four wheel drives at three in the morning it not only costs thousands to fix them but they also risk the lives of people coming up in the family sedan who dont know that the road is actually closed
2051401 t m on oudoin harrastukseni mutta t ll on omanlaisensa tunnelma
2051402 paints a modern vivid irreverent portrait of this group of painters
2051403 the extra pressure placed on finance companies and property developers in the current economic climate means the repossession and surrender of luxury cars is still a common occurrence
2051404 buyers have a unique opportunity to purchase vehicles they would normally only dream about at a price they might well be able to afford
2051405 thank you but this will not work with my schedule
2051406 in the past you only knew the parish you went to
2051407 you can appreciate the latin rite and the eastern rite and receive full spiritual nourishment
2051408 i like to bring the new catholics to a byzantine liturgy so they can get a broader perspective a broader experience of the universal church
2051409 we pray and think differently yet it is the same
2051410 weve got such a good response from the people all the letters and notes
2051411 its amazing what a man walking up and down the road waving at people was able to do
2051412 if they operate she would die for sure its just too much to take away
2051413 has her up days and her down days im still hoping for a healing but im not sure if its going to happen her up days are more than her down days but her downs are pretty devastating but theyre part of life i guess
2051414 i dont know im just going to be with her care for her
2051415 i just go within for the answer i listen to my inner voice
2051416 sehwag batted really well and took his chances in galle india are getting some good starts and that is something we will think about
2051417 if we get early breakthroughs we can manage to keep the rest of their batsmen pretty quiet if we keep that pressure on the top of the order we have a very good chance
2051418 the credit should go to our bowlers as we kept a lot of pressure on them middle order batsmen they had starts but we still managed to get those wickets
2051419 the important thing is we keep pressure on the indian batsmen the thought of losing a home series has not gone through our minds
2051420 we played really good cricket in the first test and fought well in galle we are now looking forward to this one and have to be positive with our approach it is going to be an interesting one
2051421 we are leaving out kulasekera but have not made the choice between the two pacemen thilan thushara and dammika prasad
2051422 the only possible change in the team is patel coming in place of karthik
2051423 in terms of confidence and strategy we have done whatever we can to ensure we win the test and series that is the bottom line
2051424 we did that against australia at home in 2001 after being 1 0 down all of us are looking forward to going home with the series win
2051425 sulla nostra famiglia si e abbattuta una tragedia immane ma siamo determinati a tenere viva in noi tutti la memoria di andrea
2051426 la morte improvvisa di pininfarina ci lascia addolorati e sgomenti il piemonte e litalia perdono un imprenditore capace e lungimirante che ha dato un contributo fondamentale allo sviluppo dellindustria automobilistica
2051427 con andrea pininfarina scompare un imprenditore appartenente ad una grande dinastia di industriali impegnati in un settore profondamente torinese
2051428 apprendo con dolore la notizia della tragica scomparsa di andrea pininfarina simbolo e ambasciatore dellitalianit in tutto il mondo e giovane protagonista della rinascita torinese e della vita industriale ed economica del paese oggi gli italiani perdono un grande imprenditore che si sempre distinto nella sua opera diventando una figura positiva di riferimento per tutti
2051429 a pune stiamo provvedendo allapertura di un centro di design ricerca e ingegneria in collaborazione con il gruppo tata con il quale abbiamo sottoscritto un accordo che diventer operativo nel 2009 dichiara pininfarina pi avanti inizieremo una collaborazione anche con il gruppo sonalika per il progetto world car per il momento per stiamo studiando per interpretare e capire al meglio la cultura e il mondo del lavoro qui in india
2051430 stiamo lavorando attualmente alla produzione di unauto elettrica in grado di percorrere 250 km con un pieno di batterie
2051431 for the force to be balanced there needs to be some kind of
2051432 also bin ich doch nicht so dumm wie man von mir immer behauptet hat
2051433 fr ulein sie sind ein abverheites genie wir geben ihnen eine chance usw
2051434 jetzt lerne ich nichts mehr neues die professoren antworten mir immer diese fragen k men erst in zwei drei jahren zur sprache
2051435 it slows down the movement of food through the intestine your body has to work a lot harder
2051436 there are a lot of kids who will not eat properly
2051437 and there are kids who dont have the resources to eat properly and third its for team image we stay together
2051438 if we didnt have a team meal i dont know whatd we do
2051439 at traditions you get the proper food that you need and everyones together so you know theyre eating it
2051440 we always help out if they didnt have the money
2051441 the rumor going around was if you ate the fat thats where the real energy was
2051442 of course i never ate it and i remember a teammate always asking for my fat
2051443 today we have witnessed a special moment where the maldives has embraced a constitution that will usher in a liberal and modern democracy into the country and take maldives to the rank of established democracies in the world
2051444 one of the fundamental aspects in a democracy is the right to free expression and it is the test of freedom of expression that decides that level of democratic achievements in a society
2051445 this constitution engraves freedom of expression and freedom of press as a fundamental right
2051446 we must believe that fundamental rights and opportunities do not come as mercy from an individual person or a government but they are ordained by the blessings of a higher being so that we may learn lessons from each other
2051447 time has come where we make an effort to reduce our own voices and listen to others speak accommodate their thinking and respect their views establish a relationship of tolerance and respect and learn from each other
2051448 we are not doing this as an illusion for the eye but for the benefit of the country
2051449 the real work is bringing the constitution into effect democracy can bind everyone together even if we are different from one another
2051450 what many societies have achieved in hundreds of years has been encapsulated here in four years
2051451 the new constitution of the maldives blends islamic religious values with modern democratic principles which is a rare feat even in the most established democracies
2051452 there are some amusing set pieces along the way but there is little comic momentum ultimately the paper thin plot and hastily sketched characters begin to show through
2051453 some of the things we have done have benefited us and cut our costs
2051454 there are a lot of things we have no control over we cant build all new schools but we can take as good care as possible of the ones we have and we are doing that with the budget we have available to us
2051455 but the kids have to be first and foremost in whatever we do
2051456 on some of these things if you dont have the money up front you cant do it so we have to look at any kind of energy savings we can have even if they seem like little things you know just turning off lights
2051457 the legislature is not doing what they can do for education its ridiculous that florida is on the bottom rung of states
2051458 their feet need to be held to the fire because they are falling down on the job of funding education
2051459 i have complete faith in what anil can do he can come and take over the reins
2051460 there is a calm focus and humility about how we go about it there is no arrogance in the environment
2051461 these players are aware of what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of their preparation they know they have an opportunity to make history and when each individual gets into that space we will be quite difficult to beat
2051462 there is no reason to panic and all we have to do is raise our performance levels and have confidence in each other
2051463 weve done so well over the years and we know each others abilities that trust works well going into a game
2051464 looking to the final test i dont think the p saravanamuttu stadium is going to be different from any other venue
2051465 it will be a good track great to bat on with a lot of turn on days four and five it offers bowlers something if you really bend your back
2051466 the athletes need to step up and decide that they want to stop the drug problem in their own sport until they do that its going to be an issue
2051467 if the athletes dont want it doping they cant stop it but they can eliminate a lot of it
2051468 for instance if youre on a relay team the athletes know whos dirty why are you going to run on a relay team that is going to lose a medal in five years
2051469 its up to the athletes to say im not running i know what youre doing i know whats going on if youre on the team im not running if we tell the athletes its okay to say no more were eliminating that but also bringing the competition more fair
2051470 dass f r den fall dass ihr antrag auf eine gerichtliche verf gung sich als ungerechtfertigt und sch dlich f r die tui ag erweisen sollte wir sie auf schadenersatz verklagen werden
2051471 the gunmen fled leaving him lying in a pool of blood
2051472 he was an innocent man this is a big blow to us we have lost a good man
2051473 unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years
2051474 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing
2051475 far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
2051476 there could have been a family that may not have awakened
2051477 our comparable store sales trend was lower in july than in the past several months
2051478 we believe the benefit we have received from the stimulus checks has begun to decrease as part of our normal review of store performance we made the decision to close 47 underperforming stores at the end of july after accruing the costs of closing these stores and incurring significantly higher medical expense we now expect second quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of 40 to 42 versus our previous guidance of 42 to 44 and 39 last year
2051479 im a little out of the loop in terms of electronic and club music i mostly listen to rock and im sorta confused as to why people think of us as a band that lends itself well to remixing
2051480 i wish i had something that was bigger that wouldnt fit in my babies mouths and that would still serve a purpose
2051481 i cant necessarily attack facebook or myspace but i can attack their users all day long
2051482 dont put anything on a facebook account that you dont consider public
2051483 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
2051484 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
2051485 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
2051486 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that
2051487 but were still a buck ahead of the same time last year
2051488 we got a lot out of it there are a lot of things we can do better but i thought there were some positives out there well come in today and correct those mistakes and try to move forward
2051489 were going to learn from our mistakes and move forward
2051490 we were prepared the coaches got us ready to play and we went out and we executed on some plays and we didnt on some plays we need to do a better job of executing i know im going to learn a lot from this game and i think everybody will
2051491 he was looking at me the whole way and i broke on the ball when he let it go the first one was underthrown by cassel he threw it behind the receiver and i was right there
2051492 i just wanted to go out and execute what i was taught and get the ball in the hands of the athletes out there
2051493 ive been in germany so long i think i am starting to speak like the local people
2051494 we need laws and policies that enable and encourage people to access prevention and treatment services not policies that criminalize people drive them underground or block hiv positive people from entering the country
2051495 we need more concrete programs to empower marginalized people to claim their rights only then will we overcome the forces of inequality and injustice that drive this epidemic
2051496 this rally should mark a turning point in the global response to hiv
2051497 the demand that human rights occupy the center of the hiv response has united activists from all sectors and corners of the world
2051498 stigma and discrimination are more devastating than aids and its cost is much higher because it strains social relations and affects the enjoyment of all human rights
2051499 human rights should be at the core of everything we do
2051500 the fight against aids and the other major diseases in the developing world is a fight for health and human dignity
2051501 the question we have to ask is why have we not made more progress if we know what steps are needed to roll back the tide the answer lies in the lack of demonstrated commitment to secure human rights protection for people living with affected by or vulnerable to hiv and aids
2051502 most countries have yet to implement prevention programs for populations most at risk
2051503 it all came down to space and the flexibility of space
2051504 i started here three months ago and i havent had a space to sit yet
2051505 its the most fun you can have with a guitar

2051509 i cant start marketing until i know exactly what to do

2051513 senator obama and i are working together to make sure its a big success
2051514 she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think were gonna have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions
2051515 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with senator clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2051516 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2051517 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2051518 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2051519 i think its fair to say if you look at recent history i have moved more quickly and done more on behalf of my opponent than comparable candidates have and most of them didnt endorse until the convention
2051520 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2051521 you dont have to be a delegate or party insider to witness this historic moment firsthand
2051522 to showcase the gains the party has made in the west
2051523 i have made it very clear that i am supporting senator obama and were working cooperatively on a lot of different matters but i think that delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission they can decide under the rules of the dnc and so i think it would be better if we had a plan that actually we put in place and everybody knew what it was and then we executed it because i just think that would go more smoothly
2051524 you know the these two people ran against each other for 18 months there were some moments of friction as you might imagine
2051525 if you have some people that are concerned that they are not getting the respect that they are looking for that the party not quite yet unified what is the way to bring those people back into the party to make sure that they are enthusiastically supporting senator obama by the time the november election comes around and one possible way of doing that is to have roll call that has senator clintons name placed in nomination that is one option there are other options and i think that the important thing is that this is going to get decided between senator clinton and senator obama in a way that i think both can agree unifies the party and bring people together
2051526 they cant stop them if they want to do it they cast their vote for hillary clinton and before the final roll call is finished they are going to go back through and make it unanimous by state thats one way i think to let a little bit of the pressure out of this pressure cooker but its there i mean its bound to be you cant have a convention with 1 800 delegates out of 4 400 be for somebody else and not expect there is still going to be some latent animosity
2051527 the name change of the programme to dick clarks new years rockin eve with ryan seacrest reflects the success of the co hosting responsibilities of one of americas most time honoured traditions ryan has been a tremendous part of the show the last couple of years and were thrilled hell be part of it for years to come
2051528 it may come as a shock to the government but there is a huge amount of product placement on air at the moment in american programmes and movies

2051533 bud mlb commissioner bud selig isnt going to do that if they the international olympic committee want to hold that against him then they have some serious lobbying to do to move him off the position
2051534 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
2051535 she wont file a formal request to the convention asking to be nominated along with barack obama who eked out the victory in their fierce primary slugfest

2051545 this decision about president musharrafs impeachment is going to open a pandoras box
2051546 so any notice given by them for president musharrafs impeachment can be challenged in the supreme court
2051547 there is no doubt he will fight back but given the odds against him and the unity shown by his political opponents inside and outside parliament he would be well advised to decide to bow out gracefully
2051548 if the president does not get the vote of confidence then immediately with it impeachment proceedings will start
2051549 mls is on the side right now its great to get a goal not only personally but to get a win

2051565 i think communication is a skill we absolutely need if were going to be successful in explaining ourselves in building relationships with ordinary albertans and hopefully winning elections
2051566 i understand marketing and the importance of one on one connections

2051568 i am working towards 2016 and if we could do it by 2012 i would be the happiest person on earth
2051569 realistically speaking it takes this long to organize and prepare for the groundwork this is exactly what the saskatchewan party did and what i hope to do in alberta
2051570 the conservatives actually got 84 000 more votes than they did in 2004
2051571 well why did they get that they were well organized they managed to identify their vote and get their vote out on election day the liberals failed at this task which is the fundamental of any election campaign they failed at this task miserably
2051572 theres not a hope in hell of rural albertans voting liberal until they know who we are until theyve had the chance to meet us face to face
2051573 all the united left movement would do is weaken any opposition to the conservatives
2051574 there is a bitter fight going on and the significant damage is inflicted on the enemy
2051575 citations will be issued if drivers are caught speeding not stopping for the crossing guard or passing another vehicle in a school zone

2051580 its wrong to deny funding for non religious purposes to non profit groups or individuals simply because they are religious
2051581 the constitutional provision addressed by ballot initiative 7 is the prohibition against the public funding of religious and sectarian institutions in article 1 section 3 plaintiffs fail to explain persuasively why ballot initiative 7s elimination of this barrier to state budgetary expenditures for religious affiliated programs thereby allowing them to be eligible for educational services public contracting and procurement matters is not a matter of the states budgetary process

2051593 one of the criteria for a record catch is to find some lowing clear water around some sort of structure

2051595 things i spilled on myself and or disease du jour
2051596 i just started missing fairways and its a bit excessive really

2051605 i dont think he needs to turn to me for advice hes a good guy and a great player id like to see him on the team
2051606 if you dont make it you didnt play well enough in the position ive been in ive had plenty of chances to tie it up and just havent really played that well

2051620 is there enough married sex being shown or talked about on television that intrepid defender of the nations video morals the parents television council says no
2051621 if exposure to media sex caused so many problems surely we would see the negative effect in europe kids there are exposed to even more sex explicit commercials and nude beaches yet all this nudity hasnt caused european countries to experience more sex related crimes
2051622 the concerns about a weakening economy always run to worries about the financials and then you add some negative news to them on their own and youve got what weve got today
2051623 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
2051624 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself

2051632 we were keen to go ahead and use it exactly as it was as we recognised it would give the event a nice local touch
2051633 pkba is a premier partner with ibm and were invited to participate
2051634 as our townsville location has an extensive experience and history with ibm we felt able to utilise this to provide more info about the value we can add

2051645 he is a leader who can get the best out of his players just by motivating them he gets on well with every player and has a great passion for the game
2051646 sometimes people get injured and miss games that is what happens others have to come in and step up hopefully that is what will happen next week

2051649 the board of lonmin notes the unsolicited pre conditional offer announced this morning by xstrata for the entire issued share capital of lonmin at 3 300 pence per share in cash
2051650 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
2051651 lonmins operations have consistently underperformed its own forecasts on expected platinum sales and have been subject to a declining sales and production profile at a time of robust prices
2051652 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices are required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
2051653 i think if he could have flown and just stopped to eat and sleep he would have been even happier but he was able to fly frequently and he was amazing
2051654 he struggled hard for three decades to get to the point of owning his own business here and while he loved his business he did it so he could fly
2051655 teaching me and stephanie to fly i think was like a dream come true for him because it combined two of his greatest loves an he absolutely beamed
2051656 i think he would have loved it i think hed be really sorry he missed it
2051657 even more than flying he loved his family and through all of this very difficult situation that has held us up were okay because not one day went by that he did not let us know we were cherished

2051666 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
2051667 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires

2051672 in hawaii because we have a confined space in terms of being an island state we perhaps have to learn how to cooperate and compromise more
2051673 we learn how to listen to each other and work on things in a positive manner
2051674 hawaiis spirit of tolerance might not have been perfect or complete but it was and is real
2051675 the opportunity that hawaii offered to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect became an integral part of my world view and a basis for the values that i hold most dear
2051676 he himself is a child of diversity and hawaii gave him that opportunity
2051677 he believes diversity defines you rather than divides you thats the central message of change hes bringing its nothing to be afraid of
2051678 i would never vote for obama not because he is black but because of his stance on abortion anyone that thinks a poor little baby that manages to live through an abortion should be left to die that says a lot about their ethics abortion is murder and live birth abortion is the same as they did under hitler i hope the media can get past their worship of the new star and actually do some reporting
2051679 while many may have been legitimately lost it seems probable that quite a few are either stolen or reported stolen in order to sell them

2051702 what it does is reaffirms the confidence that people can have in the queensland justice criminal system
2051703 this actually proves that the court system in queensland believes that such high profile individuals can get a fair trial in this state
2051704 in this case the learned primary judge did not avert to the possibility that any adverse effect of pretrial publicity might be dissipated by an adjournment of the trial for a few months
2051705 the system of trial by jury proceeds on the assumption that jurors can be trusted to be true to their oath
2051706 where there has been extensive pretrial publicity it is customary for the trial judge to explain the obvious points of distinction between media reports and the evidence presented in criminal cases

2051712 it would be amazing to be centre stage at the olympic games when you have the eyes of the world looking at everything you do
2051713 having spent a lifetime in sport i could not think of anything better or more exciting than cricket being part of the olympics
2051714 with the explosion of the short and exciting twenty20 over the past year particularly in india cricket now has the perfect vehicle to be part of the games
2051715 i know my time will be well and truly past if it was to happen its probably a couple of generations of players away
2051716 but the fact that teams from australia or india or china or the us could be playing cricket in the olympic games is an awesome thought
2051717 just imagine what having cricket in the olympics would do for the game globally and imagine the extra following cricket could bring to the games
2051718 from a players perspective it would obviously be a fantastic thing to be part of an olympic games
2051719 weve always just watched from the side and seen how special the event is
2051720 twenty20 offers the opportunity for cricket to become an olympic event its not only going to grow the game around the world but it will be nice for us as players to be part of a special event
2051721 it would be a dream for me to work with luiz felipe scolari who is one of the best coaches in the world
2051722 madrid have failed to value him as he deserves and i do not like the fact that they tried to include him in the ronaldo deal money is not the problem for us now what matters for robinho is to leave the club and play for scolari at chelsea
2051723 the right back position caused a few problems for us last season in terms of us not having a natural right back luke is a natural right back and played for england not so long ago he did very well for boro last season and this is a great opportunity for him
2051724 nicky is a quality natural left back who played for england 18 months ago obviously the injury to freddie bouma has left a gaping hole on the left freddie had a wonderful season for us last year and this wasnt necessarily a priority for us before the injury
2051725 but nicky shorey is more than a back up hes a quality player on the ball and is up for the challenge
2051726 the biggest boost to hamilton going forward could be the maiden victory of heikki kovalainen drivers are flesh and blood like everyone else they all have egos and get emotional kovalainen would have left hungary a couple of inches taller
2051727 he has not hit the sweet spot as often as hamilton but now he will turn up at the next race with a victory under his belt and confident of repeating his success at a valencia track new to everybody
2051728 hamilton will always back himself of course but a competitive kovalainen is good for him and a team chasing the constructors title
2051729 prices have fallen from an extraordinary high level and demands going to ease further there are signs of china slowing their fuel imports after the olympics
2051730 i fully expect this fourth attempt will end with the same result
2051731 if a member of the industry or licensee or customer of any kind comes to us with concerns or issues i believe we should speak with them
2051732 young people are creating youth communities and gangs in search of the influences that could once have been found in traditional communities
2051733 all the threads that hold a community together were given as a motivation to join gangs
2051734 arocure adhesive is easily applied using a screen printing method that places the compound exactly where its needed
2051735 an excellent example of a group blog a true community of like minded but highly individual writers topics range from the state of christian publishing to craft issues to lyrical meditations on writing as a spiritual discipline
2051736 arouses sensations we have never had before never anticipated having as though we had broken out of our normal mode of consciousness and possessed joys not promised to our birth it gets under our skin hits us at a level deeper than our thoughts or even our passions troubles oldest certainties till all questions are reopened and in general shocks us more fully awake than we are for most of our lives
2051737 i had already been waist deep in romanticism and likely enough at any moment to flounder into its darker and more evil forms slithering down the steep descent that leads from the love of strangeness to that of eccentricity and thence to that of perversity note from me previous sentence wow now phantastes was romantic enough in all conscience but there was a difference nothing was at that time further from my thoughts than christianity and i therefore had no notion what this difference really was i was only aware that if this new world was strange it was also homely and humble that if this was a dream it was a dream in which one at least felt strangely vigilant that the whole book had about it a sort of cool morning innocence and also quite unmistakably a certain quality of death good death what it actually did to me was to convert even to baptise that was where the death came in my imagination
2051738 one story i will try to reproduce but alas it is like trying to reconstruct a forest out of broken branches and withered leaves in the fairy book everything was just as it should be though whether in words or something else i cannot tell it glowed and flashed the thoughts upon the soul with such a power that the medium disappeared from the consciousness and it was occupied only with the things themselves of course while i read it i was cosmo and his history was mine yet all the time i seemed to have a kind of double consciousness and the story a double meaning sometimes it seemed only to represent a simple story of ordinary life perhaps almost of universal life wherein two souls loving each other and longing to come nearer do after all but behold each other as in a glass darkly
2051739 though of a noble family he was poor and prided himself upon the independence that poverty gives for what will not a man pride himself upon when he cannot get rid of it
2051740 it did nothing to my intellect nor at that time to my conscience their turn came far later and with the help of many other books and men but when the process was complete by which of course i mean when it had really begun i found that i was still with macdonald and that he had accompanied me all the way and that i was now at last ready to hear from him much that he could not have told me at that first meeting but in a sense what he was now telling me was the very same that he had told me from the beginning there was no question of getting through to the kernel and throwing away the shell no question of a gilded pill the pill was gold all through the quality which had enchanted me in his imaginative works turned out to be the quality of the real universe the divine magical terrifying and ecstatic reality in which we all live i should have been shocked in my teens if anyone had told me that what i learned to love in phantastes was goodness
2051741 thus i who set out to find my ideal came back rejoicing that i had lost my shadow
2051742 yet i know that good is coming to me that good is always coming though few have at all times the simplicity and the courage to believe it what we call evil is the only and best shape which for the person and his condition at the time could be assumed by the best good

2051750 what do you want me to write about this month
2051751 here are five fantastic ideas your readers will absolutely love
2051752 maybe its because im a londoner that i love london so
2051753 let spring blossom on the tip of your toes with this pair of
2051754 it got my attention because it was going so slowly
2051755 as the car passed us i saw the body had no head
2051756 he wanted me to walk away from the farmhouse and the business and leave me with nothing
2051757 the ceylon chamber believes that sri lanka must adjust and respond to significant global trends and practices that will benefit the country
2051758 one such trend is the opportunity presented via the bilateral and multilateral trading arrangements
2051759 these arrangements are more relevant in the case of our own country in view of the limited market of the country as well as the fact that we are an island nation
2051760 given the recent economic resurgence of india and the opportunities that market presents many other developed and developing countries have already commenced negotiations with india for preferential trading
2051761 is in a unique position to benefit from the indian economic boom
2051762 we need to find the niches where we have a comparative and a competitive advantage
2051763 in the absence of such an agreement even if sri lankan businesses face difficulties regulatory barriers and unfair treatment in the indian market there will be no forum or no mechanism to address these issues
2051764 a negotiated arrangement will also allow sri lanka to immediately open out certain sectors whilst on sensitive sectors a more phased out arrangements could be arranged
2051765 during the negotiation and the implementation of the agreements there will undoubtedly be obstacles and it is important that both private sector and the government work together to resolve these difficulties
2051766 while we argue and debate about the need for change other countries are already making substantial progress
2051767 were certainly not in favour of torture and i dont think any government in australia would condone the use of torture
2051768 the issue in relation to engagement with the united nations human rights system is of course not a difficult issue if you want to accept it in its existing framework with all of the multiplicity of obligations the duplication that arises in relation to the number of treaty bodies
2051769 its a matter of whether you simply say the task of treaty reform is too difficult lets just sign up to every obligation and there wont be a downside
2051770 unquestionably its torture and we believe it offends the convention and if legislation is introduced would offend the legislation
2051771 if shell do it to you shell do it to the next guy too
2051772 an accomplished businessman in his own right mr goodale has served on suffolks board since 1989 and as lead director for the past two years he is intimately familiar with the companys strategy and policy in all areas and eminently qualified to lead the board in my absence
2051773 it was also my wish that gordon huszagh serve as chief executive while i am away from suffolk he has been with suffolk for 25 years and chief financial officer for the past nine years like mr goodale he has thorough understanding of suffolks approach to banking as well as the mechanics behind it i feel confident that suffolk is in the best of hands and that it will continue in its long tradition of prudence and profitability
2051774 we are honored by the confidence expressed in us today by mr kohlmann and our board we wish tom the best as he recuperates and will endeavor to live up to the trust he and the board have placed in us
2051775 this is good news coming at a very good time
2051776 our states most critical water supply reserves those that supply water to southern california communities including long beach will be at their lowest combined level since 1977 in a matter of weeks communities throughout southern california must implement mandatory restrictions on the most wasteful outdoor uses of water and those restrictions need to be made permanent i want to thank our customers for their huge effort and urge them to continue
2051777 the board took the action it did nearly one year ago to forestall and lessen the impact of an expected water supply shortage
2051778 this rate increase has very little to do with our conservation success over the last 11 months
2051779 our operational costs like the cost of imported water and electricity are increasing at a rate greatly in excess of general inflation

2051794 we focus on europe because that is where the yemeni products are most demanded and there is a genuine interest in yemen also the procedures for marketing and promotion are less completed than in the usa for example
2051795 we hope to be able to participate in the coming exhibition but it all depends on the support we get
2051796 cbis is very interested in supporting yemeni handicrafts access to european markets but currently yemen is not one of its project countries we are hopeful that with the support of the dutch embassy we can get yemen included in the cbi project countries list

2051823 its all very well having a five star name and facilities and charging five star rates but these have to be matched by service levels throughout the hotel as many more new hotel properties open up here increasing competition service standards will become even more important to attract guests and build customer loyalty

2052142 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2052143 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2052144 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2052145 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2052146 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2052147 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2052148 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2052149 prior to the trade the jets were 40 1 to win the super bowl meaning that 100 bet on the jets would have won 4 000
2052150 after the trade the odds moved immediately to 30 1 reducing the payoff by 25
2052151 prior to the trade the jets were projected to win 7 games
2052152 after the trade the projection on new yorks wins was increased by 1 5 games to 8 5 its interesting to not that if the jets play to projection they would still likely not make the playoffs
2052153 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do

2052170 when bones in the spine move out of allignment even as little as half a millimeter they pinch the spinal cord bascially
2052171 the immune system of a patient under long term chiropractic care runs about 200 to 400 percent stronger
2052172 usually if the truth is out there its going to be replicated in study after study after study
2052173 for me to switch my practice it needs to be better it needs to be proven it needs to be duplicated it needs to be cheaper if its not then i have an issue with that
2052174 its working i believe in it i exercise the biggest thing is that i take my time and enjoy it because im benefited by it a better feeling

2052176 theres no sign saying even what the name of the structure is and no written history about it then people and society remains uninformed
2052177 the fabric of a community from your closet to ours
2052178 taking woodstock a true story of a riot a concert and a life
2052179 the composition and dynamics of north atlantic communities will change
2052180 but whether that will help or harm local fisheries is an open question humans may have to adapt as well
2052181 the interesting thing to me is that the fossil record has something to say about the consequences of global warming
2052182 t mobile is committed to protecting consumers and our company by shutting down these traffickers
2052183 we are pleased by the result in these cases and expect similar successes in our other pending and planned lawsuits
2052184 were hoping to raise lots of money along the way anyone that wants to donate we can definitely use the extra money there
2052185 no matter what were going to be raising it will just take a little dent out of the medical costs they have
2052186 you dont want to do this the first time when it happens at 2 00 in the morning you want to be out here on a day like this where you can take it easy take it slowly learn things correct your skills
2052187 i couldnt do much to fight against it there was no point in trying a search pattern out there because its so strong you wont be able to move at all
2052188 the rope just pulls tight and youre not able to do anything
2052189 black water diving is very tough you cant see anything
2052190 it all goes by feel you have to feel what youre doing where youre going when you get to the vehicle you have to feel your way around it and through it and reach in
2052191 for the gentleman that night yes he was able to actually swim right out of the water rather than have that high bank to climb out of so it was easier for him
2052192 were driving green into every aspect of our global business
2052193 this includes setting new standards for energy efficiency and green power delivering environmental and cost savings for customers and aligning key growth priorities with our focus on preserving our shared earth every company can join dell and the regeneration in this long term commitment
2052194 i want to thank our employees for working so hard to make this possible
2052195 as always our work is only getting started and this has never been more true than our focus on green
2052196 we commend dell on its climate leadership and for showing how well designed forest protection projects can generate such compelling environmental and social benefits
2052197 by reducing its own environmental footprint and protecting forests dell is addressing the major drivers of climate change energy use and deforestation while also delivering significant biodiversity and community benefits
2052198 dells success in meeting its carbon neutral goal in less than a year is impressive and should serve as a model for other u s companies to follow
2052199 the companys commitment to boost the energy efficiency of its operations and its green power purchases before focusing on carbon offsets is the right approach for achieving carbon neutrality
2052200 efforts must now focus on achieving the political gains necessary to build trust and confidence across community lines and to improve the quality of life for all iraqis including the delivery of basic services and generating employment

2052203 tengo que promocionar ambas pel culas elegy de la catalana isabel coixet y vicky cristina barcelona del neoyorquino woody allen y luego me meto en los ensayos de nine en londres
2052204 honestamente todo pas muy r pido pero siento haber hecho el drama m s serio de mi carrera y luego cuando vi la pel cula en cannes me dije por qu se r en
2052205 ellos se toman muy en serio javier y pen lope son actores muy serios eso siempre me ha parecido divertido
2052206 consuela es muy madura para su edad muy centrada muy focalizada sabe muy bien lo que quiere quiz s lo que tienen en com n es que tambi n puede sentir mucho todo
2052207 realmente me encant la pel cula me obsesion con el libro me gusta mucho phillip roth y me dej llevar por ben kingsley que creo que es un actor maravilloso
2052208 lleg en un momento en que estaba realmente de quiebre muy cansado y s que va a ser algo genial porque marshall es multitalentoso pero lo entendi y respet perfectamente
2052209 dios estoy demasiado emocionada con esta pel cula hice muchas audiciones cantando y bailando
2052210 yo practiqu baile durante 17 a os en mi vida y ahora puedo hacerlo en esta cinta y amo al personaje y estar cantando por muchas horas al d a y grabaremos con una orquesta y creo que va a ser una gran experiencia para m porque me encanta la m sica

2052212 i like to run between the tackles but at the same time im pretty quick and i can go around you and outrun you
2052213 i told him to add them to his list and he said hey coach those are some pretty big shoes to fill there
2052214 i talked to him one time after i received my offer
2052215 he was telling me he wanted me down for a visit and i told him as soon as i look at my schedule i plan to give him a call
2052216 he said hes looking for a big back to carry the load
2052217 he could come in and compete for a starting job as a true freshman
2052218 i think a key component to getting these texas commitments has been the ability for them to tour our campus
2052219 once we get a studentathlete on campus our success rate is really high
2052220 i let them know the background i have with those guys and hopefully theyre interested in preparing their body to go to the next level because i know thats their dream to get to the next level
2052221 i want these guys to do it so many times that it becomes second nature to them
2052222 its been great for us and the guys have done great at the nba combines
2052223 ronnie brewer came in at 180 and right now im training him during the off season to get ready to go back to utah and hes at 240 right now hes moving better now than he did at 180 pounds
2052224 haced lo que quer is yo ni me voy a enterar
2052225 when we saw his fall collection we were blown away
2052226 we have to watch our moves and make sure everything we do is right
2052227 hes not a bad guy but maine needs different representation in portland because clearly what we have been doing hasnt worked
2052228 i only found the unconditional love from the green party
2052229 the green party was unequivocal hand down they got the message about nuclear power so i changed parties
2052230 i can see that we have a disaster on the way and the baldacci administration has taken the katrina approach theyre basically waiting until the storm hits
2052231 this seat would be the most powerful seat in the senate that would be great news for portland in that this swing vote would have tremendous opportunity for real change
2052232 we think this will help end the myth about maine being the highest taxed state in the country we didnt think it was true
2052233 the democrats have had a super majority on every local government body for the last 40 years
2052234 he nader polled very well here i believe around four percent
2052235 the idea that having more people involved destroys the system ruins for voters and who they want
2052236 not surprisingly there is fear on the part of the maine democratic party that any progressive candidate will take away votes from allen
2052237 the maine green independent party calls on the maine democratic party to cease their attacks on the ballot access of third party and independent candidates such attacks clearly show the extent to which this party is threatened by these candidates
2052238 were trying to create room for more voices to be heard that arent underneath two separate blankets
2052239 the spoiler thing is a backlash from parties who somehow think theyre entitled to the ballot box
2052240 greens are not necessarily democratic voters who have lost their way
2052241 we think this will help end the myth about maine being the highest taxed state in the country we didnt think it was true
2052242 crush by david could you please check it maybe i got confused lol thanks
2052243 theres only one man powerful enough to dethrone jonas brothers heres david archuleta
2052244 i always check out the peoples choice buzz polls to see if there are any to vote on for david
2052245 dear ryan sharks dont just attack people they attacked people because they wanted their idol david archuleta to win american idol but unfortunately they do not have thumbs to vote and you dont care
2052246 the district has known since 2005 that theres been an unevenness around the track and the stadium
2052247 i think some of the other things about it wasnt done right or blaming this person and blaming that person i think that they leave themselves very vulnerable until they get underneath and find out what happened
2052248 i love that district i loved the people i worked with its a great community ive had my differences with some of the parents some of the coaches but there isnt a better school district to work for in the state of new york
2052249 i believe mr lawson and ms matousek have both said that the drainage was done improperly and that the company that did the drainage work went out of business well thats not true and they should know its not true
2052250 i think some of the other things about it wasnt done right or blaming this person and blaming that person i think that they leave themselves very vulnerable until they get underneath and find out what happened
2052251 i dont want someone else out there to be working harder being up when im sleeping in bed
2052252 i needed to make myself better if i was going to take myself to the next level because it wasnt on pure talent
2052253 i used myself as a guinea pig to be honest and then after i realized that it worked for me i started helping out individuals out on my track team then i would help individuals out on my football team
2052254 we were more in shape and we were able to make more speed cuts and it really helps us with our agility and stuff like that
2052255 before my strides lengthened which has made me faster i can feel it he has helped me a lot with that i noticed that
2052256 the backs had it harder lineman we had to do every 10 yards and youd sprint back that was after we ran circuits on the stairs
2052257 that was probably the hardest for me just because you have to sprint but it was long distance too
2052258 when we go to full practice and we have cone drills set up im not really used to doing those but being out here kind of gives you more practice
2052259 the response to fonolos deep dialing service has been overwhelming particularly from mobile developers and from the carrier community
2052260 an api was always on our roadmap but we decided to accelerate its release to capitalize on the excitement and interest fonolo has generated in the community
2052261 we want users to access the power of these innovations through as many channels as possible including mobile applications soft phone plug ins and carrier integration
2052262 this announcement is the first step in making that possible

2052265 im just happy that its had so much success and i dont mind playing along with it
2052266 and then when i ask for pictures i get an inbox full of this type of eye candy that nearly had me so stunned i couldnt move
2052267 i missed out on things for several years and the desire to get back in the ring has been like a fire inside of me i have been in the gym all along but started to really train for a comeback early this year i feel i have progressed to a point the where i am much better than i was earlier in my career i still have the power and the toughness but i have matured as a fighter and now possess the ring intelligence and experience to compete with the best in the division especially now the division isnt as good as when i retired before
2052268 at 39 i can make 1 more run for it people still beg to see me fight wherever i go often people ask for autographs and pictures mistaking me for the wrestler batista
2052269 i have not been away from boxing all this time because i have never been out of shape in my life

2052273 for whatever is worth that demonstrates a refreshing change of pace i really need to check how to embed flickr video on wp com but thats not a priority now
2052274 they were ill because something in their lifestyle had either caused fairly rare diseases to morph into monsters diseases or had created a whole new virus that made them vulnerable to ordinary diseases as it turned out the latter hypothesis was true
2052275 ad sales is a very different business to content production
2052276 it was fun to play and its extremely supportive but distracting to the primary mission of rocketboom and our teams talents

2052278 the numbers started out pretty good just over 1 5 million tuned into the premiere episode but the audience has dropped off denise has turned into an unappealing reality star

2052289 our goal is to obtain a leading position in the european mmorpg market
2052290 that the esv was selected by chinese christian leaders for publication with chinese cuv bible through our partnership with the british and foreign bible society since both the cuv and the esv are essentially literal bible translations they are ideally suited for a side by side comparison of the two languages what a wonderful thing it would be if thousands of people would learn english and chinese by reading the bible in side by side bilingual editions
2052291 in addition to plenty of beaches and sun barack obama will see some of the highest gas prices in the country when he vacations in hawaii
2052292 obama deserves a break from the campaign trail just like americans deserve a break from high gas prices obamas opposition to offshore drilling will only make it harder for americans to afford their own family vacations
2052293 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2052294 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama

2052297 im running for president because of because i got two daughters just like you
2052298 what see saw is a candidate who is exhausted this was a very very serious tactical error its that kind of comment that does come back to haunt a candidate
2052299 find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time
2052300 call him a racist in signs if you see him call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time
2052301 the democrats have targeted young people knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds
2052302 obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry militant white and black people who will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
2052303 de la hoya isnt what he used to be thats for sure
2052304 if oscar was in his prime i wouldnt have taken this fight
2052305 we moved here quite recently but i already have new friends
2052306 i go to school in kurta i want to study law after i finish school and become a judge
2052307 we cant find jobs we used to make a living by selling apples but the tskhinvali road has been closed for a long time and taking apples to the market by the detour road is too expensive
2052308 instead of helping us they brought in ossetians to kheiti who live there as if they were presidents is this what we fought for in the nineties
2052309 as far as we know the resettlers have a dirty past that makes it impossible for them to live in tskhinvali
2052310 we promised these people wed create conditions for them that would be better than those they had or could have ever have in tskhinvali
2052311 we always keep our promises i think many people will join the 30 families soon leaving kokoity alone with his criminal entourage
2052312 the relocation of these people to the territory under our control shows that kokoitys regime is economically and morally unsustainable
2052313 who are these people first of all it seems to me they are people from marginal social groups who have a very low level of self awareness and do not understand that this is an organisation the sanakoyev administration without a future
2052314 that is true of the low level workers who went there as for those who lead this ghostly organisation they are people who betrayed the national idea and national interest they have betrayed the motherland
2052315 isnt it crazy to think that someone would leave south ossetia for south ossetia
2052316 according to the information we possess these are families resettled from various georgian regions who had their houses seized or burnt down in former president zviad gamsakhurdias day in 1990 91 i think it would be better to give them back their old houses instead of building a new block of flats and to take better care of the georgians living in south ossetia who have been in a miserable state since the formation of the temporary administration
2052317 today i happen to be out of work and they jumped at it telling me you see you are such a good specialist and the kokoyev government doesnt need you come on move here bring your family with you well give you 1 500 dollars a month and give your wife a job as well
2052318 they promised to provide me with bodyguards a car and a comfortable life in tbilisi or kurta the choice was mine i think they are hunting for people who are unemployed or have a grudge against the authorities they are looking for people who are morally wavering i refused i was born here and will never exchange ossetia in return for money

2052333 at that age the children dont know theyre learning math and science they just know that theyre playing
2052334 its essentially programming but its so visual that the kids dont realize theyre doing some basic programming
2052335 when youre dealing with that age group you need to be very clear about your focus and what you want to accomplish
2052336 we lose some children along the way especially the girls
2052337 but we know we will need them to understand science and math later on

2052366 his voice is beautiful at the moment i think his voice is better now than its ever been because it has a sort of tenderness as well as the slightly spikey geeky thing that it always had in the past
2052367 but the thing thats interesting of course is what he decides to look at and write about he doesnt see the same world as people do he looks at the world from a different angle
2052368 david is comfortable with the ball his use of the ball is better than anyone else here and shows hes a really good passer
2052369 i think weve got good players in midfield but dave is a left sided central player which gives us something we dont already have
2052370 i would hope hell give us some more quality at set pieces thats one of the reasons i liked him when ticking the boxes as to what he can or cant do
2052371 on his cv it includes the fact that his delivery from free kicks and corners is very good which is an added bonus
2052372 he was excellent on saturday karl henry is the best all round midfield player weve got but weve got david while dave edwards has got bundles of energy and makes runs from midfield and will get goals

2052374 keogh and sylvan are still in pole position whether they start or not well see down in plymouth but there are certain players who have earned the right to be in pole positio n because of their performances together last season
2052375 they proved they were a good partnership and continue to be one no one can afford a slip up or mess about and not play right
2052376 going down to plymouth i guarantee it will be 85 degrees f and everyone will turn up screaming and yelling the atmosphere is fantastic early on in the season there
2052377 its a tough place to play they try to make their ground a real fortress so its a hard place to get points as is everywhere

2052410 its yet another effort to sharpen the theme that obama is an empty pop culture phenom and to get people to ask whether their own temptation to support him is rooted in his celeb appeal and not in a genuine appreciation of his positions on the issues or of the sort of president he might make
2052411 change we can believe in means bi partisanship instead of deadlocked partisan fighting

2052425 were definitely in a era where the nfl was back in the day
2052426 the base salary for the nfl player is at least 250 000 a year the minimum something like that should start happening
2052427 there are way too many things to just be coincidence
2052428 during the middle of a campaign you are always worried about taking some time off thats the nature of the job

2052430 moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
2052431 david carradine is a bounty hunter whos robotic arm hates your crotch
2052432 it is a first ever look at the way lawmakers voted over an entire presidency it underscores the high level of capitol hill partisanship that has been a hallmark of the period and shows that while republican support for president bush was quite high democratic support was almost nonexistent in the house and very limited in the senate
2052433 we think this will help end the myth about maine being the highest taxed state in the country we didnt think it was true

2052440 russland hat georgien berfallen beide l nder stehen an der schwelle zu einem krieg
2052441 gerade in der gegenw rtigen situation ist es besonders wichtig das gespr ch mit der russischen seite zu suchen
2052442 hilfstruppen kommen derzeit kaum zu den opfern durch und ver ngstigte menschen verkriechen sich in ihren kellern teils ohne wasser und strom
2052443 wir brauchen ein milit risches eingreifen damit der krieg aufh rt der aggressor gestoppt wird und die seiten an den verhandlungstisch zur ckkehren
2052444 in s dossetien finden aktuell milit rische auseinandersetzungen statt bei denen auch schwere waffen eingesetzt werden

2052452 mitchell is in a position where he can take computer science and turn it into something of commercial value with his partners at calgary scientific
2052453 hes an instance of someone who has been able to create things in a laboratory and clinical setting that actually make a difference in reality
2052454 it was about two months of work compressed into four weeks a lot of late nights
2052455 right now they have to transport the patient to the machine or they just dont show the patient the scan but with this the doctor can take the scan right to the patient bedside and show them

2052457 it just gives them easy access to critical data wherever and whenever they want
2052458 the gaming industry is a multi billion dollar industry and thats where millions of dollars go into the development of the gaming cards

2052460 gave significant economic concessions to continental airlines in order to secure a long term transaction
2052461 pretty clear that the agreement was not workable the way it was today and they were going to terminate if we were not able to reach some positive outcome
2052462 in order for us to have some modest amount of income
2052463 it obviously doesnt make sense for them continental to lose hundreds of millions and then for us to make tens of millions with an airplane thats supporting that network
2052464 if were not successful in those conversations than im not sure we have a sustainable business
2052465 it is somewhere in the neighborhood of a 30 drop off in capacity
2052466 above and beyond getting a unit cost improvement we also need to get a dollar for dollar in expense savings for all those asms
2052467 the national theatre in london england tried it a few years ago charging 20 pounds a ticket which is around 20 it was wildly successful
2052468 basically we asked if we didnt sell any more tickets this year than last at 20 how much would we lose
2052469 and brewster point which underwrites our summer series agreed to cover two thirds of that
2052470 so the best way to get the best seats at the best price is to subscribe
2052471 when it comes down to it were doing this so more people will come
2052472 what have i been doing for the last 34 years i must have missed something or been asleep somewhere
2052473 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league i do not understand that
2052474 i have exactly the same squad as last season and i have to be confident it is not deteriorating i cannot see how that can possibly be the case
2052475 i would have concerns if my team was full of players the same age as ryan giggs but it is not
2052476 in people like anderson nani and tevez we will see a lot of improvement
2052477 and the older ones have looked after themselves their concentration levels are still good and so is their desire
2052478 if anything paul scholes passing is the best it has ever been
2052479 it will not be easy you expect arsenal and liverpool to improve and you would think chelsea with their experience will be there
2052480 but i have to feel this team can defend its title
2052481 this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to
2052482 at the end of the day though i think all parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation hopefully we can do things going forward that maybe people will not remember that but the answer to your question is no
2052483 i think our job is to do what we try to do every day do the very best we can to put this team in a position to win games and to represent this community and this state and all the packer fans around the country well thats all you can do is try to do your job and do it well
2052484 but theres all kinds of risks in the nfl theres all kinds of risks in life you make the best decisions you can based on what you believe is in the best interests of the green bay packers and you do it firmly and you do it the way a leader is supposed to do it thats what we try to do every day with every decision we make
2052485 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot
2052486 id love to see him have the time of his life im wishing him well that he does well i think all football fans want to see him do well and we pray he will
2052487 brett has been obviously an unbelievable legend here as a green bay packer and i think even though he is going to do it in a different uniform i think all of us would like to see him do well
2052488 hes a remarkable football player ive enjoyed coaching him hes fun to watch and im sure i will watch him when he does play
2052489 the trust has had another successful albeit challenging year chief executive john stalker and his team have put on an excellent programme we increased both the size and most importantly the mix of our audience and we have achieved a small financial surplus in the light of a third year of stand still funding from the city council none of this would have been possible without the commitment professionalism and sheer hard work of all our people

2052543 this is the missing piece in californias historic effort to reduce global warming pollution if passed and signed into law s b 375 will slow the insidious growth in miles driven by california drivers which threatens to overwhelm our other efforts to reduce emissions of heat trapping pollution it will result in better designed communities with less spread out development where people dont need to drive so much consumers will also save money by having transportation alternatives during this era of rising gas prices
2052544 sb 375 is a top priority for us and senator steinberg deserves tremendous credit for his work to enact it this is the first bill in the united states to align housing policy transportation funding and climate policy the bill does this by promoting development patterns that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing housing choices reducing commute distances and reducing congestion

2052592 members of the fair pint campaign are disappointed but not surprised by the responses received from pubcos so far
2052593 enterprise together with all other pubcos have a substantial duty of care and responsibility for the stewardship of an iconic part of britains heritage they hold the future of the pub in their hands by their actions
2052594 fair pint is calling for an open transparent and fair debate about the future of the pub industry and our invitation to meet with the major pubcos is an opportunity for us all to discuss our grave concerns about the industry from a joined up shop floor and board level perspective and look towards building a positive and sustainable future for the industry as a whole
2052595 to suggest that the fair pint campaign is prejudiced and ill informed is an extraordinary message to receive back given the massive groundswell of support that the campaign is getting right across the uk from lessees of all major pubcos
2052596 this is an emotional issue for thousands of people many of whom are facing the prospect of losing their homes and livelihoods
2052597 since its inception fair pint has only taken an objective measured and dispassionate approach to what is a historically unique crisis in the pub industry
2052598 we are comfortable about this position and if mr tuppen regards anything that has been published by fair pint as defamatory then he should take appropriate action and prove his case
2052599 as a result of their enormous influence over every aspect of the uk pub market the pubcos hold a much stronger position than individual tenants when it comes to negotiating sustainable rents and wholesale supply prices
2052600 this self evident fact has led incrementally since the beer orders and creation of the pubcos we know today to the current situation where tenants profits have been eroded to a level that does sustain a reliable future for their businesses
2052601 tenants are in fact the powerhouse and generator of all the pubcos impressive earnings

2052651 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations

2052690 the heartless stone a journey through the world of diamonds deceit and desire
2052691 the more i learned the more i realized i didnt know
2052692 in many ways that was the starting point i had participated in many ways in this diamond mythology
2052693 the question is why diamonds why do we have to have this token
2052694 de beers itself used cultural imperative to describe the tremendous success of the 1930s advertising campaign
2052695 what sustains the diamond industry is the mythology in that men have been giving diamonds since time memorial
2052696 we need to know more about the source not just the things we consume but the reasons we consume them
2052697 this isnt a book about big global business this is a book about every single american diamond consumer
2052698 uranium war energy and the rock that reshaped the world
2052699 this is what i hope to do for a very long
2052700 knowingly displayed publicly explicit sexual material such material consisting of explicit written directions and descriptions of oral and manual stimulation of the vagina
2052701 as you can see we are still in the middle of this disaster and assessing the disaster
2052702 we all want normalcy to come back we havent even hit our new normal yet
2052703 while many candidates decry special interests influence in washington new reports show campaigns received 140 million from lobbyists in the first half of 2008
2052704 nearly 1 2 million is listed as honorary expenses and another 300 000 as meeting expenses all of it associated directly with either legislative or political events tied to lawmakers or government officials
2052705 these employees had no knowledge that by using the identification badges they were allegedly committing a crime
2052706 if airport authorities didnt even know that these badges were expired or fake how were the workers supposed to know
2052707 even though the large companies try to shield themselves from the law by using a temporary agency the law makes it clear that these companies are co employers and are equally responsible for these infractions
2052708 the owners of ideal staffing told us they would provide us with identification to allow us to continue working
2052709 i feel terrible because after the immigration authorities arrested us and after we paid bail they told us we could no longer work
2052710 the system criminalizes workers and allows bad companies to operate with impunity
2052711 before the next u s president takes office in january we will make it a priority to control negligent companies that are responsible for criminal conduct
2052712 harsh measures will be taken against companies that hire undocumented workers
2052713 the usual argument by ice officials is that there are always fewer owners that workers
2052714 thats when the raid happened and they rounded everyone up
2052715 all im asking is that they pay me what they owe me
2052716 i dont have enough now to make ends meet ive been looking for part time work but i just cant find any
2052717 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2052718 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2052719 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2052720 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2052721 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2052722 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2052723 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2052724 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2052725 no doubt about it it has been a tough year so far and there are more challenges ahead
2052726 the dream of a hawaii vacation is out of reach for many travelers

2052733 how many ways can i make it clear that im bourgie

2052735 you know how many people came to me calling me gay cause i wear my jeans the fresh way or because i said hey dude how you gonna say fag right in front of a gay dudes face and act like thats ok that shit is disrespectful
2052736 coming from chicago where if you saw somebody that was gay you were supposed to stay ten feet away
2052737 it took me time to break out of the mental prisons i was in the stereotypes of the fear of the backlash that i would get if you dont believe what i believe in accepting people for who they are
2052738 gay people theyre very talented and if they do something special in the world and theyre discriminated
2052739 ive flown across the world yall and ive come back here to tell you open your minds and live a happier life
2052740 you cant tackle the impending obesity pandemic simply by classifying a third of the child population as patients the solution is to change the culture
2052741 unfortunately we cant simply go to the bookshelf and find a recipe that might work for scotland we need to come up with home grown and home tested solutions

2052745 but i have one more goal and thats to win a world championship
2052746 im having fun again before i hated going to the gym to train but i did it because it was my job and i needed the money for my family i always liked to fight and the thrill of the fans but im married with three kids and i didnt like leaving them for long periods of time like training camp in los angeles i also love to eat and couldnt i wasnt able to plan family trips either but the lacy fight really woke me up i blew it im training at home now not away from my family were having a great camp me jessie brinkley edwin rodriguez and a couple of amateurs now i love going to the gym every day i work hard and then go home to my wife and kids i cant really explain why maybe its because im more mature but i know that im fighting because i love boxing
2052747 peter manfredo jr is all about what boxing should really be
2052748 hes a gentleman in and out of the ring as well as a family man who ordinary people easily relate to hes one of the few fighters today who is a throwback to the old days around here when vinny paz fought the biggest thing i see now is his desire to please his family friends and fans what he really wants is a world title his fight for the nabf interim title is a step in the process towards another world title fight for peter today the money and more and more champions are in europe peter has the ability to bring a belt back here to the united states little girls housewives everywhere he goes people want to meet him get his autograph or pose with him for a picture peter is that rare boxer who is popular not just in boxing but in mainstream america he continues to expand markets for himself and boxing in general which most certainly is what boxing needs now
2052749 this upgrade integrates a a300 a310 style navigation an md11 b717 style navigation display and collins proline4 style multifunction display
2052750 ive been in it for a long time jay was the public face but i was in charge of the boxing group before he left
2052751 i think i know boxing but i will i continue to learn about the sport the business and the people in it all the times thats one of the main reasons why i love my job
2052752 im intrigued by both fights and excited about the event
2052753 williams is very focused on winning and regaining his title and mora the man who won it all on the first season of the contender series will finally have a chance to prove if he can he step up in a real fight against a world class fighter
2052754 its a fun fight to tune into youre going to see a little guy kirilov with good technique and an incredible work rate versus darchinyan a guy with great power and great holes in his defense i know hardly anyone outside of you and me and a few hardcore nuts know about these fighters but its a good fight for august and it didnt cost a lot to be made
2052755 thats a hard question because i dont know what appeals to them i think the contender series fighters tend to be more known than other fighters and forrest has name recognition because hes an established champion but its always a challenge to find the right balance between name recognition and proper fights however thats what were always striving to do
2052756 were not a network we are subscription cable and with a premium cable ratings are not the only driving factor
2052757 its not like network tv where ads drive the money however ratings are important and ratings tell you a lot ratings tell you whether people are interested in the show whether youve scheduled the program right and we look at them and believe that they tell us a lot but i program for my subscribers all of them not just the boxing nut job who calls me up to vent about this or that
2052758 although i appreciate those guys because they are the base of our audience i dont program solely for them and i dont program for the boxing writers who can sometimes sound a lot like the nut jobs
2052759 there are some fighters who we have featured in the past and will continue to feature because they deliver value to our subscribers that boxing writers just dont like
2052760 antonio tarver is the main guy i and just dont understand it
2052761 tarver has delivered very good ratings hes delivered for the network and ive enjoyed having him associated with the network i think hes a dynamic personality but for some reason the press has decided that hes not an elite fighter that he doesnt belong on our network and some writers have been out of line in the manner in which they expressed this opinion
2052762 i dont understand the negativity we get from some boxing writers dont they realize it hurts the sport
2052763 dont they understand that some major fights have to be built in order to keep them off pay per view we dont want to put our biggest fights on pay per view we want to keep them on showtime pay per view is a self fulfilling prophecy that only shrinks the viewership of the sport
2052764 i think boxing writers need to police each other and have some discussion among themselves about what the goals and motivations are behind some of the things they write
2052765 im not saying boxing writers shouldnt bring skepticism or critical analysis to everything they write they should but when people bring their personal relationships into their rhetoric whether its an article blog or stream because to many of the readers its all the same its mystifying to me
2052766 heres what i say to some of the boxing writers out there live a day in the network executives shoes and deal with the money the politics and the personalities and see if you get the perfect fight every time thats impossible
2052767 im not against criticism personally but for the sake of the sport everyone needs to reexamine how they write about it why bite the hand that feeds you
2052768 the day showtime gets out of boxing is a sad day for the sport because hbo cant sustain it alone
2052769 hbo is always striving to put on the best events they can and im always looking to put on best events that i can its that simple
2052770 the biggest challenge is the juggling act of the fighters the fight camps the promoters the venues the sanctioning organizations the dates and the money its all got to get together at the level we operate these are not 20 000 shows we put on these are multi million dollar events there are risks taking place on all levels by every party involved and everyone is being careful
2052771 sometimes it happens with just a phone call making vazquez marquez was literally a 2 minute conversation on the phone
2052772 showtimes boxing program is as strong as its ever been
2052773 we have had an enormous amount of success in keeping our audience keeping our reputation up and keeping our subscribers happy
2052774 we are continuing to lift our quality assurance and the quality of our properties
2052775 part of this process is to remove those properties that are dragging the quality of the brand down
2052776 this is a terrific result for best western australasia and a clear illustration that our stringent quality assurance program and increased marketing activities are working
2052777 we are working to maintain and increase these results consistently across all areas in the year ahead

2052794 theyve been very cooperative getting back to us so we can work through these issues so we can sit down and discuss them

2052823 we have recently written to liberal democrat mp tim farron in his capacity as chair of the launch of the fair pint campaign expressing our deep concern at the irresponsible prejudiced and ill informed nature of many of his pronouncements about pub companies some of his comments verging on the defamatory
2052824 adopting such a stance does not imply a willingness to make a balanced assessment of the relationship between pubs and pub companies
2052825 clearly i have to ask myself whether a meeting with your steering group would add value to the debate and given the positions seemingly adopted by those who appear to represent your campaign i regret that i see little point
2052826 i recognise that these are very difficult times for the licensed trade and that some of our tenants and lessees are struggling to keep pace with the many pressures surrounding them
2052827 far from being the rachmanesque blackguards that you attempt to portray enterprise is also working harder than ever for less profit supporting our licensees often with substantial financial help where appropriate
2052828 the whole team will continue to work with our licensees to the best of our abilities in due course we will submit our evidence to the select committee where i trust that we will be given a stern examination but a fair hearing
2052829 punchs approach has always been one of proactively encouraging individual licensees who have a specific issue to speak with us directly
2052830 we will continue to do exactly that and are very pleased to meet with and to support any of our licensees requesting help or advice this approach of an ongoing business partnership with our licensees is of great importance to us
2052831 we do not therefore see the benefit of meeting with the fair pint campaign and are not prepared to conduct an open dialogue with the fair pint campaign through the media

2052860 the amount saved by awarding the bid to c amp s engineers 15 100 could be better spent to purchase much needed equipment for our city departments
2052861 i believe that the fiscally responsible thing to do is to award this contract to the lowest bidder and not spend the additional funds
2052862 these funds can be put to better use during the course of this fiscal year

2052932 ive seen these things not work out for so many people because there are so many other things that they are not taking into consideration

2052987 but we wouldnt be alone it would be a war of the caucasian peoples against georgia and russia would be obliged to protect its citizens
2052988 at a local level georgians and south ossetians can get on and want to live their lives in peace

2053086 the university is a community of scholars dedicated to teaching students and furthering knowledge
2053087 i asked myself is it acceptable to keep on the faculty a professor who intentionally misrepresented contract payments as gifts concealing this fact from the university for many years with result the university was deprived of indirect costs potentially approaching 400 000 and he intentionally submitted graduate students work as his own without consulting his students
2053088 there was just a gross musty smell to the place its going to be good to get rid of that

2053104 any idea whether this will work on the original 9200 pvr
2053105 i think its safe to assume that now that bell has introduced this feature their competitors wont stay behind for long and no internal hds are not swappable on any pvr unit that im aware of unless you dont mind voiding the warranty
2053106 do you think rogers will do the same with their pvrs i know this is a bell sponsored website but it is only fair that we get both sides of the coin i there also a way to swap the harddrives on the machines just like on the ps3

2053110 our customers told us that they wanted to pay less for extra baggage and have a simple system that they can understand the savings under the new policy will be enormous for many customers for example on air new zealand 50kgs of luggage will cost just 15 while it will be between 150 230 on other airlines
2053111 in addition to the first bag up to 25kg being free customers can also take an item of baby or medical equipment such as a baby stroller car seat or wheelchair at no additional cost
2053112 for air new zealands gold gold elite and koru club members their second piece of luggage will also be free
2053113 we are very pleased to commence the construction of the air arabia centro hotel this is an important initiative and part of air arabias strategy to grow ancillary revenues
2053114 we are also happy to appoint gustav pegel amp sohn for this significant project pegel have an outstanding track record in the middle east region and with their expertise i am confident we will create a hotel with high quality standards in construction and amenities
2053115 air arabia centro hotel will further complement the unmatched services that our passengers continuously expect from air arabia we are confident that this hotel once completed will provide passengers with a complete travel experience offering the best value for their money
2053116 when we added a website and shopping cart system our numbers went through the roof
2053117 this teamed with high positioning in the major search engines really created a whole new market for us that was never expected
2053118 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our e gaming photographic images sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are
2053119 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way
2053120 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
2053121 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the e gaming photographic images sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
2053122 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
2053123 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
2053124 after starting an internet e gaming photographic images sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
2053125 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time
2053126 with internet e gaming photographic images sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
2053127 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our e gaming photographic images company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire
2053128 one has to balance artistic talent with the rigors of usable multimedia
2053129 and as a result we tend to only hire those who are from accredited design universitys such as risd

2053131 a perfect example of why the american notion of a free public education is a bad idea hes nothing more than a wad of protoplasm a deadhead that one i should have failed him but that would have meant another semester reading his bloated prolixity so i promoted him im so ashamed
2053132 i told him there would come a time when those wronged would ask for restitution i never thought you could actually pay in flesh from the buttocks region i thought he made that one up
2053133 we think it was a marionette show when he was perhaps six years old a little horse puppet called him fat can you imagine an explanation of what actually precipitated his later behavior would be pure speculation

2053139 strengthening the squad has obviously been in our minds for quite some considerable time
2053140 we have agreed a fee with reading for nicky shorey a quality natural left back who played for england 18 months ago
2053141 obviously the injury to freddie bouma has left a gaping hole on the left freddie had a wonderful season for us last year and this wasnt necessarily a priority for us before the injury
2053142 but nicky shorey is more than a back up hes a quality player on the ball and is up for the challenge
2053143 our comparable store sales performance in july was near the low end of our 1 to 1 planned range

2053159 i am so sick of people bashing synchronized swimming those of you who do should try it sometime and see just how difficult it is to tread water or balance upside down in 12 or more feet of water while trying to stay synchronized with other teammates or with music these girls train even at the youngest levels year round and are some of the most conditioned athletes you will ever see i encourage everyone to watch olympic sychronized swimming coverage and truly think about what they are doing in the water it is a combination of swimming dance and gymnastics notice the flexibility and endurance these girls exhibit considering it is an american sport its truly a shame that we have allowed it to become a joke

2053163 i have witnessed successful hunting of fish by two of our local eagles the white bellied sea eagle
2053164 i noticed that while the white bellied sea eagle has a rather gentle approach to catch its prey the brahminy kite closed its wings and dived down to its prey
2053165 i also noticed that they hunted when it was cooler i e when the sun is hidden by the clouds or when the storm clouds gather
2053166 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something
2053167 as a citizen of the united states and speaking for the us as a whole we do now officially disown and disavow the rpg net poster known as zenten he does not speak for us and his opinions in no way reflect the opinions or attitudes of the united states or its populance please do not refer to him as an american that is our word and he has no claim upon it

2053169 in ancient days when mystical shit was big and in your face somebody fucked up and broke everything and now things suck
2053170 for me sa career ko talaga i really shifted before kasi talagang theater lahat now since i got the opportunity in
2053171 kasi kaya rin ako nakarating dito sa sop kaya ako nakakanta sa philippine idol dahil sa mga taong to from theater i mean theyre the ones who helped me mold my craft and develop my singing kaya i really owe a lot to them and i know that i will only become better joining this group
2053172 comeback ko sa theater ito dahil the last time i did theater was two years ago sa
2053173 well tony to be played by christian bautista is also a dream role but rif dream role ko rin siya sabi nga ni tito audie gemora yong tony wala namang dancing pero yong singing talaga yong pinukpok pero dito sa role ni riff singing dancing and acting you will see a really different side of me as a theater actor
2053174 ive always believed that he has a great potential to be a leading man kokonti lang mga leading men natin sa theater na guwapo matangkad at magaling kumanta
2053175 talagang na pressure ako sabi ko na pressure ako kasi alam ko kung gaano kagaling talaga si tito audie lalo na noong prime niya this was shown in 1981 the time he was my age 26 25 di ba so sabi ko kailangan mapantayan ko yong standards niya i also ask him constantly kung tama ba yong ginagawa
2053176 ako medyo starstruck ako kay joanna ampil and rowena vilar dahil sa rehearsal pa lang lahat ng mga nakatrabaho ko sa industriya sila yong mga tipong hindi pa ako nakarinig ng ganito
2053177 it made me feel kumbaga alam nyo iyon pag pupunta ka ng rehearsal kailangan prepared ka yong hindi lang basta basta kailangan alam ko yong ginagawa ko kasi sila alam na alam nila yong ginagawa nila
2053178 sa pagiging family man talagang it became my priority talagang yong oras ko bilang na bilang family man na ako kumbaga kung dati after the rehearsal puwedeng gumimik ngayon hindi na puwede talaga
2053179 talagang mayroon kaming understanding ni sheree na pagkatapos ng rehearsal kapag walang trabaho dapat may time kay baby you know may time din kay sheree so sabi ko talagang priority siya talagang halos nakasulat na talaga and its something that im really enjoying kasi ibang buhay e
2053180 matagal na rin naming napag usapan ang kasal even before the baby but sa ngayon talagang its something that we indefinitely postpone and something na kailangan naming pag ipunan
2053181 not na hindi namin gustong magpakasal yet pero i want her to give naman something na gift yong grand siya for me minsan lang kinakasal di ba so for me i see it as something precious you know talagang malaking regalo sa isang tao

2053185 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
2053186 such methods endanger the driver and other road users and can never be recommended
2053187 the rac should not listen to the rubbish from their daft colonial counterparts at the aaa

2053193 while i was moaning simon reached for the rubber gloves and slipped one on being punished with a rubber gloved hand had me screaming the pain was wicked and the sound of the rubber meeting my plastic wrapped skin almost made me come he quickly cut through the plastic wrap without kitchen scissors freeing my ass for a new king of spanking my cheeks were already throbbing but i still managed to raise my hips off the counter to meet each blow
2053194 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
2053195 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example that the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
2053196 so the question is does it make more sense for the oil companies to pay for it or does it make more sense for the struggling waitress who is barely getting by to pay for it
2053197 and the answer is im going to fight for the waitress not because i hate the oil companies but because i think its more fair
2053198 you must be the change you wish to see in the world

2053203 glop i cant hear you over the banshee wail of these space vampires
2053204 far too often we see that individuals who participate in these atrocities come and seek to hide in the united states lie on their visa applications and try to blend in in the american neighborhoods our work is designed to ensure that we identify these people prosecute them criminally where we can and then remove them from this country to make sure the united states is not a safe haven for these individuals
2053205 the perception is its a childless white couple that adopts from overseas but thats not what i found

2053209 there is a sense that a world is ending maybe not this year but inevitably the election and obamas candidacy have focused these anxieties like a lens i found whites frustrated and indecisive about the campaign families at odds generations divided many who thought themselves beyond prejudice were surprised by their suspicions of the young black man from up north meanwhile many slave descended blacks hugely supportive of the half kenyan half kansan hawaii reared obama seemed afraid to hope too much inoculating themselves with pessimism about the chances that any man of color could win the presidency even this man even today or that if he does he will survive

2053219 through the media weve been informed at this point the governor is placing on hold these grants that have about a 6 million impact on our community

2053221 that 6 million is total between us and the schools but its unfortunate the states going to try to balance their budget woes on the back of the localities

2053241 trilogy homes pass the true test of a green home by integrating a mix of energy saving and energy generating devices that deliver immediate and long term benefits for our customer
2053242 today corporate social responsibility goes far beyond the old philanthropy of the past donating money to good causes at the end of the financial year and is instead an all year round responsibility that companies accept for the environment around them for the best working practices for their engagement in their local communities and for their recognition that brand names depend not only on quality price and uniqueness but on how cumulatively they interact with companies workforce community and environment now we need to move towards a challenging measure of corporate responsibility where we judge results not just by the input by its outcomes the difference we make to the world in which we live and the contribution we make to poverty reduction www csr gov uk 2004 p 2

2053248 i dont consider myself an intellectual but i appreciate that my work was looked at seriously here in europe

2053327 basely undermined by the hostile stabroek news headline article that saw it fit to highlight negatives about guyana that article deceptively reasonable urged tourists to be aware of risks to be entertained when coming to guyana obviously at a time such as this it was intended to discourage participation
2053328 unpatriotic and unashamedly hostile stance of the stabroek news to the ppp c government their open flirting with the opposition pncr much maligned resolve to undermine the participation in carifesta x
2053329 lets put it this way with the wealth of print media in guyana a resort to highlighting at this specific time these issues brings us to what is the question i dont know why this is paranoia i am about to host carifesta i am hosting countries from within the region and out of the region i am hosting tourists quite a bit of economic activities are envisioned to flow from this activity and here is this loyal stabroek news saying out there to the tourists saying you are coming please be aware
2053330 i suppose they will claim that we need to be guided at the end of the day this is cabinets position it is deemed to be hostile and intended to parrot the pncr line they pncr have a willing acolyte in their move
2053331 apparently has succeeded in pushing their acolytes in the stabroek news editorial or whoever it is to take on that responsibility
2053332 indeed i did not mention what specifically aroused the quite reasonable ire of cabinet guyanese and the representatives of countries participating as well as intended visitors

2053379 the dwc project has demonstrated a holistic approach to meeting the needs of growth and development it is a model that can apply to future greenfield developments anywhere in the world life and lifestyle options should also include local or regional access to employment education and personal growth resources connections to commercial and recreation centres and ways to meet neighbours and take part in the community

2053611 we stripped it down to 116 grams as we know that adding or taking weight might mean winning or losing a competition and came up with the flywire the minimalist design of the laser runner was definitely one of the hardest things to achieve as we had to continuously strip back the original design and introduce multi functional details
2053612 this project was inspired to me by the 1989 san francisco giants vs oakland athletics baseball game
2053613 kids in and around the bay area were happy that either of the teams they supported had made it to the world series and i remember seeing a kid wearing a split hat half oakland athletics half giants and that image burnt inside my memory
2053614 that whole idea of i am just one thing doesnt apply anymore in the world we are living in
2053615 besides the jacket is not just about showing your support to different teams but it can also be used by athletes who want to pay homage to both their country and the host country at the olympic games
2053616 i observe with concern the human rights violations suffered by members of the charco la pava community such as arbitrary displacement from their lands loss of housing and destruction of agricultural crops and other abuses such as the excessive use of force and detaining of members of the community that have opposed the construction of the hydroelectric project including women and children
2053617 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset
2053618 our mobilator shows people just how much their mobile content is worth for many people mobiles are an extension of their daily lives with personal memories once in a lifetime contact details and the odd sexy text holding huge importance putting a cash value on it all seemed the best way to highlight the value of peoples mobile lives the one thing the mobilator cant put a pound sign on is the emotional attachment to your personal content so the message is clear you should protect what is valuable to you
2053619 if you lose your data then often the loss for the individual is much more than the value of the handset itself in most cases the information lost on a mobile is hardly ever retrieved if a handset is stolen the data loss has proven to be the biggest inconvenience and trauma during a theft as you never know who has your details this takes us into the realm of id theft and fraud
2053620 we fully support openmokos decision to publish the schematics of the u blox gps receivers
2053621 why should industry be afraid of opening up its design
2053622 schematics are simply another form of documentation and vital to future success service and satisfaction in the market we believe our products would be incomplete without them
2053623 one of the freedoms we value the most is the freedom to explore to fully understand the details of complex systems to adapt and enhance them
2053624 we now take our commitment to openness to the next level by releasing our schematics to the public allowing anyone to find out how the system works and how to improve it

2053631 whats especially interesting about this milestone is we did this in only our third quarter of operation after re launching business in 2007

2053640 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
2053641 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
2053642 moscow is today more nationalistic less democratic and more confrontational toward the west than it has been since before the fall of communism

2053655 josh has taken full advantage of his opportunity thats why were going to give him an opportunity to compete and win the right guard position
2053656 he doesnt act like a rookie you dont see guys running through a gap and him turning his head around wondering what happened he seems like he gets it
2053657 this coaching stuffs overrated hes got some natural football instincts that you like
2053658 im not surprised i know what im capable of im very confident in myself as a football player
2053659 i respect the level of competition at this level and i realize that everyone is great here but im also very confident in myself and i know what i can do if i put my mind to it i know physically and mentally i can do it
2053660 youre filling more run gaps being more physical instead of jamming a receiver youre jamming a tight end and youre blitzing so youre in the trenches with the linemen so you have to muscle up a little bit its getting in there getting dirty instead of corner which is kind of finesse
2053661 the last couple days we havent practiced up to our standards what were used to and what we feel were capable of doing its been disappointing
2053662 i dont think it should be an excuse theres big things going on elsewhere in life theres guys over there in iraq fighting in a war and were worried about favre you have a job to do do your job we expect our guys to do better were not practicing the way we have been offensively and were concerned about it
2053663 i thought aaron had a very good day especially after the prior two practices
2053664 i thought the team as a whole had a very good day

2053679 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
2053680 while it is well known that water plays an important role in the folding process we usually only look at the motion of the protein
2053681 this is the first time weve been able to look at the motion of water molecules during the folding process
2053682 my husband casey and i were the first people to stay at this wonderful place and we absolutely loved it the rooms were comfortable and the downstairs living room super warm and cosy the owners steff and kenny did everything to make our stay there as comfortable as possible steff made us sandwiches to go when we missed breakfast one morning we will definitely go back

2053685 dospei is a beautiful village in an absolutely brilliant location you only have to come and look around to see why we fell in love with this particular village it is very rural very friendly and very very peaceful all in all we couldnt have asked for a better location or better place to live as for bulgaria in general we enjoy the lifestyle the weather summer and winter and the friendly locals

2053692 daca nu ar fi opozitia celor 41 de baroni locali care ar pierde din privilegii atunci ar putea fi create regiuni in care unele servicii judetene cum ar fi educatia sau sanatatea sa fie concentrate intr unul singur
2053693 este clar ca in timp o serie intreaga de servicii vor fi concentrate in aceste regiuni cum ar fi spitalele regionale iar banii de la guvern vor merge pentru proiecte regionale care vor ajuta la dezvoltarea economica a zonelor
2053694 ar fi de mare interes pentru mine un punct de vedere al dumneavoastra cu privire la impartirea administrativa a tarii pe care nu va ascund personal o consider depasita impartirea pe judete nu permite dezvoltarile regionale nu permite o viziune regionala in ceea ce priveste chiar investirea banilor de la ue

2053703 surprisingly we are seeing a surge in demand for financial it workers but this could be due to the work being put in to develop systems that allow for better risk the good news is that we are seeing stability across it positions as a whole with no further significant drops since the beginning of the year in fact an increase in networking positions is a positive sign that infrastructure projects are still going ahead

2053708 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel
2053709 i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
2053710 the loan to partner will enlarge the financial resources of the organisation and help expand its lending activity this in turn will significantly increase the outreach of efse in bih providing additional refinancing for more than 6 000 new loans to mses and assist in satisfying growing demand for access to finance
2053711 the partnership between efse and partner will develop further in the future as partners plan to become a for profit commercial organisation progresses this investment confirms the confidence that a respected institution like efse has in partner

2053713 our prime objective is poverty alleviation but our loans dont just target the poor
2053714 around 90 percent of the syrian population doesnt have proper access to financial services there are various reasons for this including low average income and tax avoidance
2053715 we can provide a lot of support to these people because we can tackle the risk of lending to them
2053716 taking on this risk is part of our strategy to be a financial institution with social responsibility which can help lift people out of poverty and help them start a career by providing financial support to this shadow economy we help them to become registered companies that pay taxes and can employ new staff
2053717 as a microcredit facility we used to have just one credit line from akam geneva
2053718 now that we are transitioning to being an institution we can seek financing from commercial banks
2053719 we will be monitored by the cbs and the credit and monetary council which means we will have the same language as other banks as a microcredit facility we previously relied on funds from charity providers but this is not sustainable in the long term
2053720 our staff worked very closely with the clients because they needed to understand clients needs and demands and guide them towards better investment options
2053721 average daily income in the village was less than 50 cents a day and there were few job opportunities
2053722 after consulting with the farmers and telling them about our objectives we set up a project to introduce drip irrigation we dispensed fifty syp 20 000 usd 400 loans as part of a group loan and after one year we found that daily income had gone up to about usd 3 per person life in the village had improved beyond expectation
2053723 we are thrilled to have received this honour with ever increasing dining options in beijing and with the city playing host to thousands of visitors from all over the world enjoying the olympic games cepe truly stands out as a world class restaurant with a world class wine list one any visitor to the city would be delighted to experience

2053733 nu privesc emisiunile de televiziune cel putin in romania unde acestea sunt pur si simplu dezgustatoare prin slugarnicie sub cultura si un gen de suprarealitate unde nu se poate identifica aproape nimic din viata cotidiana de la noi
2053734 daca vorbim punctual nici macar in turcia nu exista mall uri in mijlocul orasului caci galleries la fayette din paris sau el corte ingles din barcelona nu sunt mall uri dar la noi sunt si intentia unora este sa le intinda pana chiar in preajma ateneului sub privirile prostite ale unei majoritati ce isi pierde vremea cu privitul la televizor video un interviu in imagini

2053739 its true that the number of infections is declining but consider this if the world can be satisfied with 2 7 million people infected per year 7 500 per day then im not sure where the standards are for declaring something a total disaster what i see is that we are making progress through combination prevention but in order to stop the epidemic theres no doubt that well need a vaccine
2053740 there is no greater tool to end aids than a preventive vaccine
2053741 even in a country like the u s with significant resources and education dedicated to prevention were still losing the battle against aids especially among certain high risk populations
2053742 the bottom line is that we need a long term solution to this epidemic we need a vaccine if we are to turn the tide on aids
2053743 its clear 25 years after the discovery of the virus that were on a long journey and its not going to be a straight line thats why i think that the blueprint 2008 released by iavi is such an important document long journeys require roadmaps and they require benchmarks of how were doing and both of those are in this years blueprint
2053744 divide up the mission into a set of interim milestones this is a way to measure progress to hold people accountable
2053745 the second recommendation is a practical one we have to trim and significantly improve the pipeline we believe that the 30 odd candidates in the pipeline should be trimmed based on their probability of success resources from these candidates should be re directed instead towards solving the biggest challenges facing researchers today
2053746 to move the aids vaccine field forward we have to sustain the effort we need a new cadre of young researchers we need stable and predictable financing that is flexible
2053747 failure is a momentary setback on the road to success
2053748 developing a vaccine may take more time and innovation than we once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail
2053749 scientists and those who support their work private corporations and governments alike should redouble their commitments
2053750 the challenges are huge but i have no doubt that we will live in a world without hiv some day
2053751 nearly all of us in this room were born into a world without aids we owe it to future generations to work to leave them a world without aids

2053772 urban residents across the world are starting to look up and turn a plentiful resource into a solution green roofs a green roof is a roof that is also a garden from a simple container garden to a roof covered with several inches of soil on top of a waterproof barrier and a meadow
2053773 if you increase the number of green plants in a city the temperature will actually fall
2053774 the city first drew real attention to its greening efforts when it planted a lush garden on the rooftop of city hall
2053775 we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
2053776 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color

2053778 our cities are separated by legal boundaries but together we are one metropolitan community
2053779 we share some of the same challenges by working together we can do a better job of meeting those challenges and succeeding far into the future
2053780 many of us have already been working together in the current ongoing discussions about regional transit
2053781 i believe we can take these efforts to another level by forming a caucus
2053782 these initiatives have been very successful in chicago and denver
2053783 these mayors have confirmed for me the power of mayors working together
2053784 im eager for my colleagues from across the metro area to hear what these mayors have to say
2053785 would you rather have a candidate with years of washington experience or one who will bring change and new ideas to the established system

2053787 even though youve indicated youre currently supporting senator mccain what is likelihood that youll end up voting for obama

2053794 the net is supposed to be free but thats not the case in all the countries around the world including china the country hosting the olympic games starting today 080808

2054006 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
2054007 its an epic game with some of the biggest greek heroes like jason hercules and achilles which inspired me to compose dramatic sweeping music to create the proper setting for this exciting adventure
2054008 in rise of the argonauts every design choice emphasizes immersion
2054009 we want players to actually feel like theyre heroes in ancient greece not just playing a game tylers experience with composing for film and tv gave him a fresh perspective and his music for the game set the epic tone we were hoping for
2054010 id say its in parallel its a reinterpretation of it although we realise theres a huge fanbase which has been proud and loyal and fantastic as far as the prisoners concerned theres whole generations who have never seen it obviously we hope to appeal to both
2054011 were hoping not to get tied to the original as such
2054012 bill gallaghers a very clever writer and there are references to the original and other things so in a sense it will be both enigmatic and mysterious and hopefully unfathomable in very much the same way as the original was
2054013 i think weve been able to retain the meaning of it or lack of meaning of it if you like and so far its fitted really rather well
2054014 you would appreciate that the cost of borrowing money has been escalating on a daily basis and because we are operating in a hyperinflationary environment it has become increasingly difficult to get clients who come in to borrow
2054015 in instances where they do come in they are put off by the high interest rates because these have to be constantly reviewed to enable the industry to succeed
2054016 this might appear to be a small amount to others but in this line of business it is a lot considering subdued business
2054017 the idrinkwell com 2008 national survey of american cocktail culture attitudes and trends
2054018 the business dinner lunch or after work drink have become rituals in our society and often the way we build relationships or strike deals
2054019 the idrinkwell com survey reaffirms what many in the business community have long known seemingly social interaction over drinks can have a radical effect on the bottom line no wonder business travellers tap their full powers in choosing a dining location

2054038 its been almost a year already and it feels like it just happened
2054039 it was a lot more work than i thought it would be but i really enjoyed it
2054040 when you say you are from the caribbean people think all the islands are the same but each island is unique so i felt it should be my job to explain and show them what sets the cayman islands apart from the rest
2054041 at first i wasnt sure and then i realised that it was me i began to cry tears of joy because all my work had paid off and i had received one of the greatest personal rewards of my life so far
2054042 i believe i have but dont know how the community feels definitely where my platform for saving the environment is concerned i worked very hard
2054043 i am now thrilled that caymanians are finally taking our environment more seriously even though a lot more needs to be done i am proud to say that caymanians are at least taking important steps
2054044 i always stress on the point that being unique is a good thing and that there is only one you in the world while giving a motivational speech at cayman prep with a group of 15 year old girls i was able to express this when i had finished they all ran up and hugged and thanked me and i felt that even though i had been there for just an hour our talk seemed to have meant so much to them and that feeling will remain with me forever
2054045 it will be sad i almost dont want to give it up but im ready to move on to other milestones and achieve other goals
2054046 being miss cayman islands has been a huge step in my life and because of it i am already half way in achieving my lifes goals because it has made me realise what i want to do with the rest of my life
2054047 i want to take full advantage of my scholarship and pursue my mba and climb the ladder in my field
2054048 i also want to adopt in vietnam i went to a few orphanages and trust me if i could have afforded it i would have brought two children home with me

2054057 this is the best deal we could get after seven years we were between a rock and a hard place
2054058 we were never against the gas project but against the methods being used which would harm the marine environment

2054067 i will remain with manchester united for at least another year
2054068 my coach ferguson was kind enough to come and see me in lisbon a few days ago
2054069 therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
2054070 i never wanted to leave against manchester uniteds will and im going to say something here that ive never told anybody if we hadnt been european champions i probably wouldnt have even thought about going to madrid
2054071 its no sacrifice for me its a great honour i have important things to win in england i want to defend the european title and help united become world champions not forgetting the premier league and other competitions
2054072 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying
2054073 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
2054074 i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
2054075 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
2054076 i knew that real madrid was interested in signing me and yes for a while i wanted manchester to accept their offer i wanted to play in spain at real madrid in particular and i thought this could be the right moment my family would welcome the change
2054077 the chance of being an hours flight from my mother was very attractive but i now want this to end i was the one that was responsible for all this controversy but it was never my intention to cause friction between these two clubs
2054078 saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness

2054086 there are certainly similarities in the two homicides the one in lake park ga and the one here in columbia county but further investigation shows it is highly unlikely daymon heard is responsible for the shooting death of mrs linda raulerson on july 22
2054087 our detectives have spent countless hours interviewing family and friends to determine if he might be our suspect but the pieces are simply not fitting together to complete this puzzle
2054088 we will not rule anything out at this time but we feel very comfortable he is not the man responsible for the cold blooded murder of mrs raulerson
2054089 our investigation has not stopped and we have worked hard not to get tunnel vision on mr heard
2054090 there is a need for sexuality education that goes beyond teaching the basic biology
2054091 society should not be afraid of young people having sex it is a reality
2054092 a new national curriculum on sex education tells young people what not to do sexually without telling them why or explaining to them the most basic things such as how intercourse happens
2054093 teaching about the risk of hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases is necessary but it must go hand in hand with teaching about healthy sexuality and communicating with young people about their experiences

2054130 we thought we would end the series with a light fun romantic comedy that is sure to entertain and delight our audiences
2054131 it has been a hit at festivals around the country and in its over seas release
2054132 ty liebermans script struck me as having the makings of a really fun romantic comedy i immediately loved the premise of the wedding movie with a twist
2054133 the situation in which these characters find themselves was compelling on the verge of marriage our groom must choose between his fianc e and his first love
2054134 i felt there was a delightful paradox in the fact that his first love was a man it is both crucial to the story and yet incidental this could happen to anyone thematically i liked how the screenplay took sexual identity out for a spin
2054135 think my best friends wedding with a sexual twist and you get the picture
2054136 the film is a lot of fun and a lot of laughs and our audience is on the guest list of a very funny wedding
2054137 son it really depends on how much conscientiousness one has you see people of true and sincere faith in god already have it made as to how to worship god and more importantly how to deal with the day to day chores of living god must be more than just someone we bow and pray to or write notes to god is more than some being we claim to call on us in our sleep and ask us to deliver mankind god is certainly not some deity who demands of us to blow half the world in his name as some of our misguided wahhabi so called jihadists contend all of these nincompoops are not doing god any favors by claiming to correspond with him each in his own way
2054138 but son dont you think the israelis have those nukes to face the arabs who are waiting for the first opportunity to annihilate the jewish state which was imposed upon this region by a misguided international community unable to tell right from wrong
2054139 mother you see all of these people are just messing around with religion to suit their own mundane aspirations the zionists have pulled a big number by claiming that god would truly sanction real estate to trespassers who do not have the least legitimate proof of ownership of the holy land which was ordained by god for all his truly god fearing believers of all faiths and which has been inhabited by the palestinians for millennia we all know god to be just and merciful and certainly would not allow for an injustice to be meted out in his name the neo christians are seeking some spiritual comfort for relief from an extremely non altruistic culture that has overtaken one of the most beautiful regions of the world ever since the white man first set foot on massachusetts bay there are different explanations of how the christians could come up with the idea of obliterating the jews but the zionists think their stockpile of nukes will avoid that so they believe that letting the neo christians think like that suits their purposes well for now they may actually be encouraging people like george bush and dick cheney to think that this is godsent christian belief then we have our lunatic wahhabi suicide legions that have been scientifically reared to disguise themselves as the angel of death and just blow up anything that moves believing this to be the pathway to paradise nothing is further than the truth these loonies are buying a one way ticket to eternal hell for having distorted islam beyond recognition and caused most of the havoc that is shaking the world today they even established an unusually powerful clergy which is anathema to islamic belief since allah forbids the emergence of a clergy as a medium between man and god yet thanks to the trillions of petrodollars they have access to they have managed to spread this heretical sect of islam to the far corners of the world expending around us 200 billion over the last three decades alone i am not sure which is more dangerous to the moslem nation or ummah but if you ask me i think that the last of the three is a fifth column we really have to keep our eyes open to they have seriously damaged the image and the position of islam as a leading sensible and down to earth simple faith

2054179 fred macmurray when he was good he was bland but when he was bad he was really good

2054226 its a date that all superstitions point to as good fortune especially for newlyweds
2054227 there is absolutely no justification for allowing an f word like this to air unedited on prime time broadcast television
2054228 there can be no question that this was an intentional act on the part of the network someone actually had to edit the scene with the word into the show
2054229 last week cbs said they wanted indecency laws overturned and today we found out why
2054230 based on their behavior it would appear they feel the law no longer applies to them anyway
2054231 dont you need necromastery early to do any decent amount of farming early game
2054232 but what about levels 8 11 wont using shadowraze push the creeps too far and youll get ganked
2054233 i think a void stone is enough isnt euls overkill
2054234 why would you grab a lothars everyone knows that blink dagger has a lower cooldown costs less mana costs less gold and isnt countered by a 375g ward
2054235 one of the great things about this class is that in the past a sizable portion of our incoming class is made up of transfer students but this year almost all of the class is freshmen
2054236 the great part about that is freshmen stay with you for all four years
2054237 i think an important part of growing is balance for this institution
2054238 we cant grow too fast but we must grow consistently to reach our goal
2054239 that is about the rate that you can assimilate new students into classes
2054240 it wouldnt be good for the students who are here if their class sizes grew more than they expected
2054241 parents love the fact there are only 10 or 12 students per class that is what separates us from large universities where a student could have a freshman psychology class with 700 800 other students
2054242 they also like that our freshman classes are taught by full time professors and not assistants
2054243 we find that if we can get the students to visit incline theyll come to snc
2054244 you can show them a picture of tahoe or tell them about our winter sports but once they stroll across campus you can tell they really fall in love with it
2054245 i hope they keep the school small and still very select
2054246 i think its very important for the school to continue to fund scholarships as they grow
2054247 that traits such as obesity during adolescence that may increase the risk of attacks from peers can result in health and psychological struggles that remain through young adulthood
2054248 victimization may not only reinforce the negative self concepts that a risk factor for victimization such as obesity may cause but a risk factor for victimization such as obesity will also make it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized indefinitely in other words the risk factors that strengthen the links in this pathway will also keep the pathway intact because it is also a risk factor for being victimized
2054249 ive hunted all my life but ive never seen a bear

2054257 hes been talking nonstop about his penis anyway i couldnt help it
2054258 how many programmers do you need to replace a light bulb
2054259 he wanted to resign because he is putting 10 hrs a day at this job while his other friends are on bench go to office play table tennis and make more money than him
2054260 so bad is the situation that i once had an employee all of 23 years old come to me and said
2054261 look at wipro infosys and their profit margins while our product companies keep on making losses
2054262 why should i work hard to make the entrepreneur rich give me a deal excite me with your idea make me a partner and give me a roadmap i am ready to share the pain together
2054263 where are those original and exciting ideas for which i can put my career at risk
2054264 so bad has been the impact on the start up space that it is difficult for start ups to hire quality employees as most prefer to be
2054265 because of their own inefficiencies they have created a beast which is now unmanageable think about it the indian it employee has got an average salary hike of about 20 year on year which means in the last decade salaries have gone up 5x and attrition is on a all time high
2054266 they have created a new breed of employees which i call the
2054267 so bad is the situation that i once had an employee all of 23 years old come to me and said and make more money than him
2054268 u need to really understand the market and dynamics the co was acquired for a big number and afaik founding team made 6 7mn

2054272 interestingly still author wonders why his employees were not ready to put in extra efforts
2054273 i guess everybody is well aware that staying on bench for long is marring their productivity their technical and learning growth and as a result their future opportunities
2054274 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2054275 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the democratic national convention and with the obama campaign
2054276 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election

2054278 there was once a mom and pop kind of web shop selling auction products making money through the affiliate commissions she the wife would do the design and customer contacts and he the husband would do the programming of the site mind you they had no products of their own the only thing they could do to sell more was thus not to improve the products but simply improve their site to bring in more people and do more sales

2054282 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
2054283 its probably better if we dont say hi were looking for
2054284 the early signs are very encouraging but i would expect a lot more two way trade and investment over the coming years as the private sector impetus grows on the back of increased understanding of the opportunities on offer
2054285 small companies are at a disadvantage as they tend not to have the depth of knowledge access to advice and expertise to understand what opportunities are on offer
2054286 in particular we made enormous progress on the development of our intellectual property laws which are a major source of interest for foreign investors and one of the principle foreign direct investment determinants
2054287 the continuing rise in trade volumes is the early fruits of the agreement
2054288 if a turtle was to see a lot of movement or flashing lights it might get scared and lay its eggs in the ocean instead of on the beach this would give the eggs absolutely no chance of survival
2054289 you should not stray from the path because dangerous animals come out at night we have some very poisonous ones especially the snake
2054290 the snakes here are some of the most poisonous for their size in all the world they are so poisonous that if you are bitten and dont get treated within four hours you will die more people die of this snakes bite each year than in car crashes in costa rica
2054291 thanks dad that really helps me conquer my horrible fear of snakes and gives me tons of confidence about walking through a pitch black jungle with only one flashlight and a guide who can barely speak english

2054293 fortunately i have never learned to take the good advice i give myself nor the counsel of my fears
2054294 the disappearance of cobble and paving stones has been more of a deterrent to the overthrowing of governments than machine guns tear bombs and automatic pistols
2054295 it is not enough of a book but still there were a few things to be said there were a few practical things to be said
2054296 these images stayed with me even after i left the city images so violent and malicious that they seemed to be my only point of reference for a long time afterwards after i left
2054297 se or naitane in whose house i had hoped to pass the night pushed me out into the street and bolted the door the generator cut out from all directions i heard the sound of hooves dwindling into the night i slept behind a bush
2054298 the gravest moment in my life is having surprised my father in profile
2054299 how often have i lain beneath rain on a strange roof thinking of home
2054300 the heat was hard on the girls and we taught them the different ways to walk across town using the narrow cross streets and the high buildings for shade
2054301 the secret is not as important as the paths that led me to it each person has to walk those paths himself
2054302 tradition relates that upon waking he felt that he had received and lost an infinite thing something he would be able to recuperate or even glimpse for the machinery of the world is much too complex for the simplicity of men
2054303 perhaps some feature of that crucified countenance lurks in every mirror perhaps the face died was obliterated so god could be all of us
2054304 hail nothing full of nothing nothing is with thee he smiled and stood before a bar with a shining steam pressure coffee machine
2054305 if you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people
2054306 if china has the policy of improving life style its alright if they improve the villages as well they always threaten tibet it is our right to protest why are they always intervening in tibetan affairs it is our right to protest
2054307 for 64 percent of those questioned membership in the eu is the most important issue
2054308 the businesses were found to do an exceptional job providing moms who are breastfeeding with a private place to express milk time to pump during work and educational information on the benefits of breastfeeding
2054309 i think its just people being misinformed and uneducated on the topic i just want to get more moms knowledgeable about breastfeeding and the benefits just to know how important it is in the long run for their kids
2054310 we expected that at some point we would find it in this area
2054311 i think we hoped we had a few more years

2054314 he wont experience too much of the pressures right now
2054315 captaincy will be about a few months time the next couple of series he faces
2054316 then he will really understand what its all about running a team getting the team to play for you it is going to be interesting
2054317 hes got a once off test match against us he will obviously be hugely motivated excited nervous and have a lot of energy in this game
2054318 it is easy to make one off decisions and it doesnt really matter what happens in this test match
2054319 it is six months time when you have gone through that process you have carried your team to that level you have sustained the team you want to play the brand of cricket you want to play and the management of those players
2054320 thats when it starts to show so for us the best way to keep him under pressure is to beat england
2054321 like we did to michael vaughan we kept him on the back foot in terms of his performance and as a captain we know that pressure grows very quickly upon you
2054322 i would think there is a mutual respect in terms of performance thats basically probably as far as it goes i guess
2054323 at the time i thought he had us on the ropes
2054324 we were we werent bowling well there were two very lengthy sessions and he and paul collingwood had got england right back in the game
2054325 even though they were only 140 ahead we didnt really have any answers at that time of the game
2054326 that was obviously a big opening for us and in a way we were lucky we got a lot of soft dismissals in that second innings one thing i will say is that captaincy will make him think about that now
2054327 you bump your head a lot of times as captain i certainly bumped my head a few times as a young guy
2054328 it depends also how you face up to bumping your head do you learn from them take those lessons on board those are going to be important things for him
2054329 for them it is about making the decisions not only for this test match but about when they go to india and for the ashes
2054330 to pick steve harmison now they obviously have a plan for him to play in the next ashes series at least i hope thats what they would be thinking
2054331 they have picked a little bit more of an aggressive team it does leave certain openings if we can play good cricket here and again it will be about the first couple of days
2054332 england are going to come back fighting they will want to put in one good game for the series
2054333 if we can play well for the first couple of days maybe we can suck the wind out of their sails and finish things off in a wonderful way
2054334 the publication of the 2007 scottish household survey shows a slight decline in the number of people smoking in scotland down from 25 per cent in 2006 to 24 7 per cent last year
2054335 however the relationship between smoking and deprivation is again highlighted with 43 per cent of people in the most deprived areas lighting up compared to just 12 per cent in the more affluent
2054336 the figures clearly demonstrate smoking prevalence declines as deprivation reduces although it is good news smoking rates are continuing to fall overall across scotland more needs to be done to narrow the gap between the haves and have nots in our society
2054337 we are delighted with our q2 2008 results especially given that we achieved sequential quarterly growth during a period which is typically seasonally quiet and throughout the euro 2008 championship in the first three weeks of july we experienced stronger poker trading and significant growth in both our bingo and sportsbook businesses our various strategic initiatives are progressing well and given the good start to the third quarter and our clear business strategy we are confident of delivering future growth during 2008
2054338 we really have no visibility on when this is going to move
2054339 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2054340 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2054341 the case seems to get stranger and stranger by the day
2054342 there is just no acceptable excuse for this woman partying while her daughter is missing
2054343 dans ce cas il sagit dune euthanasie mais accepterait on de supprimer une vie si un tel handicap ne se r v lait que bien apr s la naissance si nous pouvons nous fier au verdict du corps m dical pourquoi ne pas aussi faire confiance la m decine pour ce qui est du traitement
2054344 lavortement est une d cision douloureuse prendre pour nimporte quelle femme et son partenaire
2054345 its safe to say vincent will make it to the end of the show
2054346 it just seemed like a perfect way to stay current with the state of television today
2054347 its safe to say vincent will make it to the end of the show
2054348 it just seemed like a perfect way to stay current with the state of television today
2054349 it was a horrible horrible decision that we still dwell on but i dont think the doors closed obviously right now were tied up with apb and everything else but hopefully in the future we will have the resource and something can be worked out with microsoft
2054350 to erase all negativity in the minds and hearts of our communities to stop the hating of ourselves other races classes and cultures
2054351 in the los angeles unified school district alone there is a 40 dropout rate among african americans and over 30 for latinos we are here to spotlight the importance of education for our youth
2054352 this is about more than just a football game its about a generation that needs to see for themselves what historically black colleges and universities truly have to offer
2054353 this is a difficult one and its going to take a careful look to see whether or not we are going to do this
2054354 where you lived determined how well you could protect yourself or your children from known convicted sex offenders
2054355 this is such an enormous sea change and there are so many considerations to take into account if we were to deal with it would take a great deal of effort
2054356 common sense would tell you that having your name picture and home address on the internet as a sex offender at age 8 12 or even 14 could be devastating in terms of peer relationships community relations ability to stay in school and involvement in church activities
2054357 weve just been notified that we are on alert to deploy at a moments notice
2054358 thats when the phone calls start when the market goes bad and they get a statement
2054359 to know if you have a bad planner is often not easy
2054360 you may not know till its too late and that can be scary
2054361 the net result was i was only about even after six months because he was making commissions on all the sales
2054362 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort
2054363 so be careful make sure youre changing for the right reason
2054364 the correct strategy is not to sell out and go to cash its to say this too shall pass and say what your strategy is for the next time the markets up
2054365 a bad adviser is going to blow with the wind a little bit more
2054366 if the adviser doesnt have a strategy they can articulate to you you can pretty much guarantee that youll have poor results
2054367 thats when the phone calls start when the market goes bad and they get a statement
2054368 to know if you have a bad planner is often not easy
2054369 you may not know till its too late and that can be scary
2054370 the net result was i was only about even after six months because he was making commissions on all the sales
2054371 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort
2054372 so be careful make sure youre changing for the right reason
2054373 many agree that its time to end all this negotiation nonsense and work on peaceful resistance
2054374 the chances of reaching an agreement with israel before the end of 2008
2054375 what will happen to the pa will we continue with the pa as a captive authority until israel has finished doing what it wants or will we tell the world and israel that enough is enough weve been trying so hard for the last 15 years we couldnt reach a settlement and we learned our lesson
2054376 thats why were going to give him an opportunity to compete and win the right guard position and really kind of take daryn and allen barbre and jason and really kind of work a three or four man rotation in the left guard and center position
2054377 we had him in here for a pre draft visit and he displayed very good awareness on the board going over various things on the board
2054378 hes able to transfer that on the field his awareness for a young person is very good he makes good decisions understands the scheme and doesnt have mental errors
2054379 when daryn and jason and tony moll came in they had to move around a little bit we didnt have as much depth but we feel like we have depth now in that room it has enabled him to just sit and lock in on one spot which will help a young player
2054380 his awareness is just very good for a young guy as far as working and finishing and those things he does a terrific job with that hes going to get an opportunity to run with this first group a little bit and well just see how it goes
2054381 you come into an nfl training camp and you are ready to compete
2054382 obviously you want to come in and make the team as your number one goal when playing time comes up you obviously want to compete for that and thats what im doing
2054383 i know what i am capable of i am very confident in myself as a football player i respect the level of competition at this level and i realize that everyone is great here but i also am very confident in myself and know what i can do if i put my mind to it physically and mentally i know i can do it
2054384 he did a very nice job with how he handled himself
2054385 the game isnt too big for him so hes not intimidated by the scheme or the volume that we have
2054386 it helps to have all of that experience around you early on in your career and not necessarily have to rely 100 percent on yourself
2054387 you can look over and they are going to tell you what to do theyre going to get you right just having that experience around me is obviously a huge benefit for my success
2054388 all of them have been great spitz mark tauscher wells i mostly deal with them on the right side they have all been great helping me with the playbook if i need it or on the field giving me pointers they are all real good guys and very helpful to us rookies
2054389 you kind of just have to get over the fact that wow this is a great position im in and that lasts about a day then if youre not playing well youll get yanked out its a situation where i think his ability to stay even keeled and not let things overwhelm him has been one of his biggest strengths other than the fact that he is a really good football player
2054390 coming in to rookie camp and otas youre kind of a deer in the headlights rookie dont know what to expect
2054391 you get through that and you kind of learn the playbook through all of that which is a huge help so youre not just coming into camp and taking all of this on
2054392 so stoked to get through that one with such big scores
2054393 the waves were fun and i just went for big turns and ended up winning i hope i can keep things going this way for round 4 and further
2054394 a user can click on a surveyed offshore area and download maps displaying sonar targets likewise a user may click on the name of a parish then click on a specific waterway and view maps and photos provided by the u s coast guard
2054395 a local user can obtain information on specific waterways view debris location and photos and be informed of potential boating hazards a casual non local user gains a snapshot of the environment in louisiana the work being conducted and the impact that hurricanes katrina and rita are still having on daily activities
2054396 if those cameras werent here i dont think either of those two new zealand movies would have been made
2054397 show of hands would have used three quarters of a million dollars of film stock thats a 2 million movie
2054398 so i was good at sourcing suppliers and the money side of this production
2054399 now i understand the film process it is very primitive youve still got these big expensive machines costing half a million dollars to do jobs and even now there are software packages that cost 1 000 and do the same thing
2054400 the goal is to convince the director cinematographer and producer that if you have a 2 million budget youd be crazy to spend 300 000 to 400 000 on film stock
2054401 why not put that money in front of the camera in better sets or costumes or actors
2054402 weve had years of video camera technology and it has always looked like rubbish these are the first cameras that dont look like rubbish they look great people have such a huge bias against shooting electronically because weve had 20 years of it being cheap and nasty
2054403 you have a 400 gigabyte cartridge and youre filling that up every 24 minutes having that uncompressed frame to come back to with really solid colour depth is amazing you can really see the difference between that and the algorithms that end up on tape
2054404 its already profitable but it will take a bit of time to pay off all the capital
2054405 i didnt have to deal with that and i dont think id have liked that by the same token i was anonymous and the public perception is that sam was the entire company
2054406 no one freaked out i had a couple of peripheral people i hadnt heard from for years approach me for money
2054407 you think about the kind of interest your money could earn obviously this has been a reasonably big expenditure
2054408 but im still a pretty frugal person ive always had huge freedom i had ten years as a musician where i was technically unemployed i had everything i needed a guitar a synthesiser and a computer if i wanted to go to the movies i could if i wanted to buy a six pack of beer i could
2054409 it sounds terrible but the gift i have is the ability to think like a stupid person i dont think people are stupid but they dont want to use a piece of computer software that they have to read the manual for first
2054410 she was highly annoyed that i would spend 12 hours a day on it over the christmas break knee deep in asp
2054411 i sent an email out to everyone i knew about 50 people in the first week i had 200 members
2054412 sam took notice because it grew faster than trade me had
2054413 he said well buy a quarter of your company and give you advertising on trade me in return the two sites became closely affiliated
2054414 it sounds terrible but the gift i have is the ability to think like a stupid person
2054415 i dont think people are stupid but they dont want to use a piece of computer software that they have to read the manual for first
2054416 theres an ebay phrase they use a monkey could drive this train
2054417 the online auction model is almost the perfect business model you cant really have competitors because your marketplace is bigger and more efficient even if a competitor comes along that is better by that time youre big enough theres no stopping you
2054418 ebay did a deal with telecom and they became the auctions link on xtra xtra was with msn and they had a million unique visitors we were maybe 300 000 we were worried about what that level of advertising could do
2054419 sam focused on the human resources side of it and expanding the company into automotive and real estate i was used to having my way and sam is exactly the same
2054420 we clashed a little i thought i was better than him but when he came back hed really raised the bar
2054421 i was getting emails from my friends saying you should join this website it was the first hugely viral thing here they got 20 000 in the space of a few weeks we put the might of trade mes advertising behind it and we only got a couple of thousand members
2054422 instead of getting 30 members a day we started getting 200 a day
2054423 we hit findakiwi and kept going then they were purchased by friends reunited in england it wasnt a major success
2054424 one of the lost opportunities for that is that it doesnt do social networking
2054425 there were always 20 projects we knew were big money makers oldfriends would get prioritised down to 13th in the queue thats why it hasnt changed in a long time
2054426 he was reading a newspaper article about the bbc struggling to find people to fill their reality tv shows theyd go to the pubs and look for people
2054427 cameron had this idea where you would put up audition notices and people would pay to apply for them
2054428 the first week we got a thousand members and we made 1 000
2054429 you could extrapolate out and say holy shit in two years well be making 50 million
2054430 it seemed unreal when you were making 5 million in profit to say youd be making 50 million in two years but thats exactly how it turned out
2054431 he was right as long as the curve kept going up
2054432 i was used to having my way and sam is exactly the same we clashed a little i thought i was better than him but when he came back hed really raised the bar
2054433 sam was trying to shop it around theres a famous story where sam offered it to trade amp exchange for a million dollars when it had no income they said no
2054434 in hindsight it is easy to laugh at it people passed up ebay and google as well
2054435 it was pretty unreal we were expecting around 500 million
2054436 the directors probably got the maximum out of it trade me was starting to saturate it was a shocking number for the public who probably thought fairfax got ripped off and the wool pulled over their eyes but it is worth a billion dollars now they got a really good deal
2054437 the problem with being involved with something like trade me is that it is so successful that its really hard to follow up in hindsight star now has been ridiculously successful there are 15 staff there and its a highly profitable business it has half a million members in the uk
2054438 camera rental is a good business but its not going to go crazy like trade me
2054439 when i write music i have certain rules in my head ill follow theres always going to be a kick drum on the first beat of the bar and theres always going to be a snare drum on beats two and four i can programme rules to write a drum pattern that sounds like me
2054440 i like the idea of a piece of software where i can hit randomise and come up with options within my rules and do the same with the other instruments
2054441 what if it could create rules based on every artist you feed it coldplay songs the drum pattern will be similar to coldplay why dont you take every number one song theres ever been and dump it through this thing
2054442 youll start to come up with rules for pop music then you get it to generate lyrics using rhyming structure rules
2054443 its the idea and executing it once it is up and running thats when it stops being as fun
2054444 ive done eight flights to new york in the last eight months i used to hate flying and be scared of turbulence but now im used to it
2054445 he took it from nothing to 150 people the things that are mine ill feel more pride for
2054446 id spent a lot of time building trade me and looking for funding which wasnt a happening thing back then
2054447 nigel was a bit of everything a musician good at math good with numbers it was an interesting brain type for us
2054448 he started on the graphical side but very quickly pushed into programming and the business decisions we were making
2054449 he did a lot of good work around making our selling processes as easy as possible they could list lots of stuff easily
2054450 nigels a reasonably average manager but hes a fantastic product person he understands the science behind how people use things and how people make decisions
2054451 nigels a smaller company guy he had the tail of the tiger but the organisation had to scale a lot i came back and grew it from four to 15 staff in six months
2054452 none of us are hardcore business types we know whats going to work on the web and we know how to evolve that and make it better all of us could go from a whiteboard down to coding and then out to a meeting were generalists
2054453 if we hadnt been successful in auctions we wouldnt have been successful in motors property wouldnt have come to us jobs wouldnt be a category the shape of the market would have been quite different if ebay had won
2054454 but we didnt realise the extent that we would win
2054455 things move a lot slower when youre a bigger company
2054456 your ability to move those innovation cycles as fast is limited i think nige found that pretty frustrating
2054457 im interested in business and investing social ventures and philanthropy hes more into film and music
2054458 but if something came up id be very open to it

2054462 i cant believe i won it was the first time i have been to the event and it was really good it blew me away with the amount of vendors and the quality of the presentations on the stands it was interesting to see all the different products in one place
2054463 i flew in today especially for the expotech i want to see what other supplies are on offer as i am a new start up company with seven people i am also on the hunt for some new resellers
2054464 i have come here today to speak to it service providers gain new product knowledge liaise with vendors discuss existing products and gain vendor support
2054465 this year we have seen record attendances in all locations and with greater participation from our solutions group and chos consumer home and office vendors next year promises to be even bigger and better
2054466 the past decade has seen a decline in the number of japanese tourists coming to australia and this visit is an important step in raising awareness of the work being done by the australian government and the australian tourism industry to better meet the changing japanese market
2054467 tourism australia will work closely with jata airlines in both australia and japan and state tourism organisations to make the most of this great initiative
2054468 these measures will reinforce australia as a first choice tourism destination and reflect our commitment to the tourism industry and our friends in japan
2054469 providing tourists to australia a higher quality experience and better value for money will increase australias competitiveness as a tourist destination
2054470 i am feeling very confident because the football the gaffer likes to play i am very comfortable with
2054471 i feel more at home and that brings the best out of me i dont think i have had that feeling since i left wigan and paul jewell hopefully it will bode well for the season
2054472 i am ready to go again and once i get going im sure the best is still to come from me and hopefully the derby fans will see that said hulse
2054473 i felt like i was coming to the peak of my career just over a year ago and then obviously i got the injury compared to the end of last season im feeling 100 per cent better fitness wise
2054474 i feel hungry again and determined to get there again and i know all the rest of the lads do so we are going to be fighting to get out of this league playing some nice football along the way and hopefully winning games
2054475 ive come to a massive club in derby they have a massive fan base and have a good chance this year it is an exciting fresh start
2054476 catholicism is as often a proxy for ethnicity as it is for belief i observe lent not because i believe in the risen christ but because my ancestors have done so for a couple of thousand years
2054477 as an empirical matter im sure that last sentence is true though logically im not quite sure why that should be the case abortion isnt really much taken up by the bible
2054478 oh i dont believe in anything darwin proposed i just like the cute fish with legs and my dad was a big science guy
2054479 im not quite sure why that should be the case abortion isnt really much taken up by the bible
2054480 before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you i appointed you a prophet to the nations
2054481 happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones
2054482 how would you like it if this were your child
2054483 in most instances you will find an evangelical putting more effort into following or attempting to follow with failure of course the scriptures they read their bibles and pray more which thus exposes them to greater conflicts between what christianity expresses and what the world offers
2054484 oh from this word to that period is going to be verse 23 so i better make it a good one i hope it will be useful for summarizing a complicated issue into an easily quotable catch all explanation
2054485 i am sorry megan but you are not catholic for you to claim to be one merely because your forgo chocolate for a couple of months in the spring and attended church when you were a child but dont now believe in the most basic tenants of the faith is really insulting to catholics
2054486 also youll find that the words of god or jesus are where the teachings are not in the psalms or other passages
2054487 im confused in this thread isnt psalms the words of god
2054488 despite the trolling by ml j the psalms are religious songs written down sometime around 6 7th century
2054489 the appalling things that god and jesus are quoted as saying and believing and doing in the bible such as specifically anything from the new testament
2054490 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
2054491 you are a troll you post purely to raise ire and distract
2054492 but that part of it was written in pieces over time by many authors believed to be divinely inspired and that other parts are what i said songs and letters and such revelations was written by a questionably mad man detailing his visions
2054493 the presence of hell and by extension souls and heaven is the apalling thing jesus believed in that he told people about it in order to prevent it from being their fate is the apalling thing he did youre right ive never seen any mention of long running punishment for unethical behavior in any other history lesson
2054494 youd be surprised how many times ive seen fundies make just that claim but you see i never made that claim nor did anyone in these comments you decided to post a snarky response to a legitimate point because some mythical third party at some point said something different which i dont trust you on anyway that is what trolls do
2054495 well leave it at that its not worth discussing this as neither of us will be swayed either way ill believe youre a moral cripple youll beleive im a moral cripple and well both be worse for it
2054496 also youll find that the words of god or jesus are where the teachings are not in the psalms or other passages
2054497 im confused in this thread isnt psalms the words of god
2054498 thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
2054499 i dont understand why the doctrine of hell is so terrible we send people to prison which is certainly no fun for committing crimes sins all the time why is it so heinous for god to do the same
2054500 with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
2054501 i believe prison sucks so you should avoid going there
2054502 i see that i was not clear i can understand why someone might think that hell was a bad place and god was a mean dude for sending people there
2054503 i believe prison sucks so you should avoid going there
2054504 if the choice is between goiong bowling with the warden and going to the prison and if the warden is willing to bowl with most anyone whod like then youre damn right id bowl with him and encourage my friends to do so
2054505 im not convinced we choose our beliefs the way we choose our shoes
2054506 and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the infant leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost 42 and she cried out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
2054507 atheists and non believers do not necessarily burn in hell they might be eternally separated from god and believers which in a sense means hell but any pain might come from that and being wrong while otherwise they might live fine
2054508 im catholic and i believe in evolution both interspecies and intraspecies and so have all the priests i have talked about it with which makes sense since it is accepted by the church i would think someone as well versed in being an a hat wouldnt make such a flaw in such a well placed ad hominem attack
2054509 and where would they live is there a lesser hell called heck is there beer there my remembrance of teaching about purgatory was that it was merely a temporary place what sort of non official heresy are you positing tr
2054510 im often intrigued how much militant atheists secularists want a religious person to be an ultra traditionalist or fundamentalist
2054511 as an empirical matter im sure that last sentence is true though logically im not quite sure why that should be the case
2054512 arent all christians evangelical arent all christians called to evangelize
2054513 the columbia river crossing will ease the congestion impacting one of the most important commercial routes in the country
2054514 the presidents order is an important step toward making this project a reality so we can get goods to market
2054515 a college party isnt a college party if theres no rusted root
2054516 shooting animals trapped within a fenced enclosure and calling yourself a sportsman is like hiring an escort service and calling yourself a ladies man
2054517 the time has come for the tennessee wildlife resources agency to put a stop to captive shooting
2054518 canned hunting violates the very basic principles that hunters profess there is no sportsmanship in shooting confined animals for a fee

2054523 it became much more important to make all these choices as a witting conscious consumer of life
2054524 and deeper than that there was a sense that if you did follow a traditional route
2054525 why does he hate us have we done something to offend
2054526 seriously you want a guy who thinks community is having the people in the lunch place know your name running digital media where in the present we are trying to build new types of communities
2054527 since wwebnet does not require anyone to visit a web site to actually see a broadcast quality film the target marketing capabilities and potential of expanding broadcast network footprints are potentially exponential wwebnet delivers content right over the top of any cable satellite or digital delivery network automatically and directly to a targeted device its secure private branded channel platform provides the perfect system for companies to improve communications decrease costs and create the ultimate weapon against high priced courier solutions due in large part to high oil prices

2054534 the roof leaked so they took off the second floor of the barn
2054535 small restaurants pay their staff a decent hourly rate tips are then an added extra big businesses have been using this loophole to keep costs down

2054547 arent you assuming that millicents pretty shallow whenever ive heard agents and editors asked at conferences or on their websites about whether cosmetic issues can get a manuscript rejected they always disclaim the notion with scorn isnt it the writing that matters ultimately

2054563 any idea whether this will work on the original 9200 pvr
2054564 i think its safe to assume that now that bell has introduced this feature their competitors wont stay behind for long and no internal hds are not swappable on any pvr unit that im aware of unless you dont mind voiding the warranty
2054565 do you think rogers will do the same with their pvrs i know this is a bell sponsored website but it is only fair that we get both sides of the coin i there also a way to swap the harddrives on the machines just like on the ps3

2054637 as the media theorist marshall mcluban pointed out in the 1960s media are not just passive channels of information they supply the stuff of thought but they also shape the process of thought and what the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles

2054643 these activists have delivered a message of solidarity with the tibetan people highlighting the grave situation in tibet just moments before the beijing olympics began
2054644 the chinese government wants the world to be dazzled and distracted by the grandeur of the opening ceremony but its true face can be seen in its ruthless and intensifying repression of the tibetan people

2054664 remember that this greatness was won by men with courage with knowledge of their duty and with a sense of honour in action who if they failed in any ordeal disdained to deprive the city of their services but sacrificed their lives as the best offerings on her behalf so they gave their bodies to the commonwealth and received each for his own memory praise that will never die and with it the grandest of all sepulchers not that in which their mortal bones are laid but a home in the minds of men for the whole earth is the sepulcher of famous men and their story is not graven only on stone over their native earth but lives on far away without visible symbol woven into the stuff of other mens lives

2054676 mastercard luxury week hong kong is a key event in support of our fashion and fashionable lifestyles platform globally
2054677 we are looking forward to seeing a wide a range of designers on the runway showing everything from couture gowns to designer street wear and to compliment this we are pleased to be offering mastercard promotions designed to assist the cardholder in accessing a little luxury too
2054678 with the demand for luxury goods and services in asia pacific estimated to grow an average of 12 per year between 2006 and 2016 businesses need to understand the needs of these consumers and their distinctively different demand characteristics in order to succeed
2054679 in hong kong alone the discretionary spend of the affluent is set to grow more than 73 to us 17 billion in 2015 and their spend on luxury goods and fashionable experiences is a key part of their expenditure
2054680 likewise china is another market whose affluent consumers are expected to be the worlds largest luxury goods consumers in the next decade according to mastercard research in 2006 alone spending on luxury goods in china was up by 50 this clearly shows that domestically the new wealth in mainland chinas major cities is powering spending lifestyle choices and mindset changes among affluent consumers
2054681 occasionally you see very small amounts of zygnema in the water in the lake but it usually tends to settle
2054682 its just really striking to see that level of green
2054683 its just symptomatic of whats going on around the lake
2054684 were not winning this battle right now and we dont seem to have the collective will to address the issues
2054685 i wouldnt use these two things to mark the broad effectiveness of trpa erosion controls and source reduction programs
2054686 all indications are the 10 years of eip and some of the bmp compliance work in the basin has helped us turn the corner in terms of water quality and lake clarity
2054687 unless you find an anomaly that makes it obvious that this one source is causing the problem you cant just point to one thing
2054688 were hoping that by putting this out somebody can help solve this
2054689 whatever information we can find would be helpful to finding out what happened to him were not sure what direction to go in
2054690 i think since there were no skid marks or no signs of his being hit like glass breakage i think either someone took him there and dumped him or that someone threw him out of a car and ran over him
2054691 i wouldnt think somebody would want to hurt him he was very outgoing he was the type of person that wouldnt argue with you he would walk away
2054692 he was very much a people person a lot of people liked him
2054693 i can rest at peace knowing hes gone and died but i cant rest at peace because of what happened to him and for the injuries hes had
2054694 i dont want it to happen to somebody else and i dont want this to be forgotten
2054695 hopefully something will turn up because somebody did this to him and they need to be held accountable for it its been a big loss
2054696 he was very positive about the surgery and felt he had a lot to live for
2054697 but i got to see him before he died i sang to him i hugged him i told him that i loved him
2054698 rabbi sam was a wonderful caring man he taught us to help others
2054699 in july our children and grandchildren came to ocala and we spent a few weeks together and it was wonderful
2054700 sam loved ocala he used to talk about the rolling hills and the landscape but what he loved most of all about living here was the people

2054704 imperative that the impacts to potential routes corridors are examined as well as the potential impacts to the surrounding municipalities
2054705 deficiencies workmanship failure to meet expectations and or scheduled completion dates for promised repairs etc
2054706 the moderates won a lot more of the contested races than we did
2054707 when nick wins a chairman will probably need his support
2054708 i think now we know what direction were going in
2054709 last nights meeting was i think as players what we really needed we got a definitive answer what its going to be and its going to be the green bay packers without
2054710 its just time to get on with our business now now its just about the packers and not about the situation
2054711 the last couple of days has been a tense atmosphere
2054712 we didnt practice well and thats just from an offensive standpoint i think today was better i think tonight will be better and we have to get moving as coach said
2054713 in a positive sense i think this has actually been a good thing for our team to continue to galvanize us and allow us to focus on being a team
2054714 this is a team sport and theres not one person thats going to make or break us i think thats really the focus thats what weve come to the conclusion as a team that all of us have vital aspects obviously the quarterback position touches the ball on every play but were all going to be in this together to get these wins
2054715 youre in the trenches with the linemen so you have to muscle up a little bit
2054716 its basically a mentality of grinding your teeth and getting in there and getting dirty instead of at corner where its kind of finesse but its working really well
2054717 everythings a whirlwind so i have to slow myself down
2054718 ill miss a few calls here and there because im so new at it but im getting the hang of it and its coming fast its coming faster than i thought it was going to come so i just have to keep working at it
2054719 i thought aaron had a very good day especially after the two prior practices

2054723 but where youve got high populations or a longer germination period weve found shadow to be more consistent quinmerac helps with poppy control
2054724 it will be the best product on the market following the withdrawal of trifluralin but if there is a long germination period poppy control might not be 100 we could see a few more red fields in the future
2054725 if it is primarily cranesbill i will use springbok on light land with poppy speedwells and pansy novall is a good choice
2054726 for general broadleaved weeds butisan plus treflan is a relatively cheap option
2054727 it means we will end up having to use full rates of other options trifluralin allowed you to cut rates and still control poppies
2054728 it can make the crop go white but it does grow away
2054729 the group expects to deliver a satisfactory result for the full year
2054730 im here to represent my country to the fullest and im here to be an ambassador for my country

2054745 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2054746 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2054747 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2054748 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2054749 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2054750 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2054751 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2054752 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him

2054835 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
2054836 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
2054837 we suspect an outbreak of bird flu judging by the number of people who have fallen ill with bird flu symptoms
2054838 we are now waiting for the results of blood samples we sent to jakarta
2054839 they are working together with local officials and the local husbandry office to prevent any eventuality
2054840 this is not the year to celebrate as tibetans have suffered untold repression under the chinese regime rather it is time to mourn and offer prayers for those died and imprisoned in recent protests across tibet
2054841 carry out strong protests until no one is left in the township
2054842 all performers who are going to beijing must have the strongest consideration for political responsibility and must show the best ideological form in order for the performance to be lively and attractive the performance must be symbolic of the great unity of ethnic groups in the tar and to represent the remarkable achievement of tibetan people under the excellent communist partys leaders and their policies
2054843 there were gun shots and mass chaos while the streets were filled with smoke i saw people around me fall down and my friend nyima was shot in the chest a nun died in front of my eyes as did six others during the course of the demonstrations the army tanks were quick to come and clear up those who were either wounded or dead to dispose of any physical evidence
2054844 the chinese raided our houses and confiscated our belongings i had some 30 40 000 chinese yuan from my small business which the officials took away my family in my native village later told me they had confiscated our ancestral property after they learned i had escaped into india
2054845 my hope is that the younger guys like malcolm and devin will actually hang around and just sort of rub up right against

2054847 as far as making an impact from the get go i dont look at that as a difficult thing to do
2054848 when i was 15 or 16 a friend of a friend was engineering a giants game
2054849 it was a dodgers giants game at candlestick and i got to sit up in the booth with hank greenwald and ted robinson
2054850 i try to bring as much information as possible to the table
2054851 the game is the main thing people dont tune into the game to hear me do a stand up routine they want the facts of the game i tell it like it is im not rooting for anything or anybody im not a homer
2054852 i like talking to the coaches and players and i love trying to get into their head and see the game as they see it
2054853 that way i am not just bringing the game to the fans but i can bring the insights
2054854 when i was growing up he was doing as raiders and warriors games and he was great at all three of them theres no doubt to me that hes the greatest play by play guy america has ever had

2054857 i think football wise everything you read has them projected in the top three in the conference
2054858 they have a great shot at making it to another bowl game no disrespect to arizona but the fact is arizona hasnt been to a bowl game since 1998 i dont think theres any doubt that this football team can reach a bowl game
2054859 and then the basketball team seems like it will be a young team that can get up and down the floor and be really exciting young teams will surprise you good and bad sometimes those young teams are the most fun to watch more fun than teams that you know will make it to the final four because you never know what you will get with those young teams and as long as mark fox is there you know nevada will have a good team
2054860 first and foremost it does give me a chance to move up a little bit
2054861 ive done pre game and post game shows at arizona which has been awesome but its a chance for me to be the voice of a program at the same time i get to broadcast for two pretty successful programs there arent a whole lot of colleges that have had the kind of success nevada has had in both sports it also get me a little closer to home my folks are still out in the bay area and the chance to get closer to them also factored into it
2054862 my disdain for you hellary has nothing to do with you supposedly being a woman i love women and would vote for one for president readily but i would never vote for anybody just because of gender think back to you and bills administration all of the spies lies corruption deaths smears immorality backstabbing laws broken drugs bribes chinese spies payoffs character assasinations assasinations investigations using dead people theft obfescations stealing china destruction of public property threats to bimbos assaults rape accusations sex not sex asprin factory murders tyrant coddling whitewatering rose law firming missing files dna disapearance foster bodies lies in diaries lawyers commiting suicide hidden agendas payoffs luewinskiing coverups mismanagements bodies in the parks bodies in the cell bodies in the water bodies on train tracks nuclear secrets being sold fbi files stolen hiring bouncers to rough up people blackmailings travel office scandals stealing whitehouse furniture double talk cult genocides document shreading planes crashing ron brown coverups document suppressions i went on for about five more minutes all with you hellary right smack dab in the middle either orchestrating enabling or covering up

2054908 but we are shifting too from a culture of scarcity to one of abundance that is the essence of the google worldview managing abundance so lets assume that instead of a scarcity there is an abundance of talent and a limitless will to create but it has been tamped down by an educational system that insists on sameness starved by a mass economic system that rewarded only a few giants and discouraged by a critical system that anointed a closed small creative class now talent of many descriptions and levels can express itself and grow we want to create and we want to be generous with our creations and we will get the attention we deserve that means that crap will be ignored it just depends on your definition of crap

2054978 middle class families are imho the backbone of a thriving city theyre the stabilizing force that keeps civil society together and those families will not stay in dc in part because of the schools but also in part because dc is not constructed to make it easy to have small children here in new york on the other hand there are dozens and dozens of neighborhoods where families can live within walking distance of a sizeable park replete with playground equipment sledding hills and fountains to splash in
2054979 you need a good meal before hand to fortify yourself and the kids will only get a little whiny before you get there
2054980 i would point out that many most apartments in european big cities offer this kind of courtyard
2054981 and yet for high income individuals with children thats exactly the decision they make walkable communities are more expensive per square foot than sprawling communities thats just a simple fact in every single real estate market in the country
2054982 im arguing that dc should build some damn parks so that parents who want to raise children in the city have a shot at doing so why this provokes such a hostile reaction is sort of puzzling
2054983 yep and most folks that are forced to eat at mcdonalds because of financial constraints loathe

2055000 nakatutuwa nga dahil nakasabay ko pang naglalakad si kobe bryant star player ng l a lakers sa isang mall sa macau pero hindi lang puwedeng mag pose for pictures at magpa autograph talagang sasabayan mo na lang sa paglalakad at makakakuha ka ng shots but they will not pose for you dahil talagang bawal
2055001 matagal kaming naghiwalay muna ng tinitirahan ni shine dahil mas gusto niyang tumira doon sa condominium unit which i have been renting tapos siya na lang ang nag occupy nun
2055002 before that pag napapasyal si shine sa bagong bahay namin nakikita niya yung mga kulang inisa isa niya yun at hindi niya alam pinupuno ko yun kaya nang sabihin kong magsama na kami sa tivoli at kailangang umuwi na siya sa akin nasorpresa siya dahil kumpleto na ang interior ng bahay
2055003 kung tutuusin wala nang problema konting adjustments na lang baka nga makatulong yung private moments namin sa beijing to settle other personal matters

2055012 oh it was so obviously staged when she did this or that

2055022 we think this will help end the myth about maine being the highest taxed state in the country we didnt think it was true
2055023 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
2055024 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the online casinos market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
2055025 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
2055026 its better to look through the mid range online casinos companies for ones with strong growth potential
2055027 but we have a strong relationship with our top investors and they know the online casinos field very well as a result no one gets gun shy or cold feet
2055028 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
2055029 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
2055030 i always tell my online casinos clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
2055031 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
2055032 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the online casinos market works and with patience you can walk with big money

2055036 i would guess that in 20 years there simply is not going to be any social security for wealthy people that will be thoroughly means tested and probably should be
2055037 i mean why should very rich people get social security

2055053 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
2055054 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
2055055 this proposal is as ludicrous as the half baked carve up they came up with on the victims commission

2055065 closed and protectionist european energy markets end up picking the pockets of consumers in this country
2055066 the presence of large price differentials between markets where transfer of a commodity product is unhindered and cheap speaks of some anti competitiveness activity somewhere

2055071 we are excited to be breaking new ground in our industry with game pieces that have a unique organic look and feel and are more environmentally friendly than the typical pieces on the market today
2055072 nothing has been more un environmentally friendly than the roofing industry which for more than 100 years has been defined by unsafe landfill cluttering energy inefficient products like asphalt metal wood clay and concrete
2055073 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity
2055074 while they are notorious for toxic blooms certain cyanobacteria also produce compounds that selectively kill cancer cells over normal cells which we are exploiting for anticancer drug discovery
2055075 however we will push toward studies against other cancers such as prostate and colon which have been associated with hdac overactivity and we are also working on synthetic analogues with perhaps even more improved selectivity and or potency
2055076 many scientists congratulated us on our success and are looking forward to the next round of news with our discoveries
2055077 ingmar bergmans films have moved inspired and influenced a host of filmmakers and audiences across the world it is no wonder that he is often called the greatest cinematic artist ever it is only just that the nation that makes the largest quantity of films in the world each year should also get the best quality films from across the world on the first death anniversary of bergman this festival and box set is this nations tribute to the great master
2055078 bergman stormed into the world cinema scene with two masterpieces in the same year 1957 such was the genius of this prolific director without whose name no discussion of cinema would ever be complete it hurt us to know that masterpieces made by him and other great directors had never been available in this country to the masses with this festival i personally feel a sense of satisfaction about the number of people it is reaching out to across the country when quality cinema as embodied by bergman is widely seen and appreciated quality cinema would end up being made as well

2055084 central europe is the place to look for antiques and design objects right now
2055085 france italy the uk and belgium have grown expensive we focus on central europe because the antiques market there is underdeveloped and prices are much friendlier than in western europe
2055086 given the strong euro weve made it a priority to spotlight markets and dealers where buyers from the u s can stretch their dollar we avoid tourist oriented shops the dealers we visit have a great selection and are eager to move their inventory they are motivated to sell
2055087 container shipping is included in the tour our participants can buy in quantity since there is no extra charge for shipping merchandise home
2055088 we take care of shipping customs and other details is so participants can focus on the hunt

2055108 israels secret police are pressuring palestinians in gaza to spy on their community in exchange for urgent medical treatment according to a report released today by an israeli human rights organization physicians for human rights refusal to cooperate often results in the denial of medical treatment based on the testimonies of more than 30 palestinians 11 of which are published the report says the shin bet is using coercion and extortion to force patients to collaborate
2055109 los de etnia macedonia dentro y fuera de grecia son inexistentes
2055110 arizona courts have clearly ruled that prison officials cannot stand in the way of the medical needs of women prisoners
2055111 its regrettable that we need to take extra steps to ensure that sheriff arpaio follows the law
2055112 the courts have already confirmed our position that arizona prison officials cannot ignore the medical needs of prisoners simply because they do not agree with the decision to end a pregnancy
2055113 now given the disregard of the court ruling by sheriff arpaio and his staff it appears that we need to spell out the law more clearly to protect future women detainees
2055114 i the lord do not change so you o descendants of jacob are not destroyed 7 ever since the time of your forefathers you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them return to me and i will return to you

2055117 then all the nations will call you blessed for yours will be a delightful land
2055118 if you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people
2055119 why he did what he did i think he made a comment that he wasnt going back to prison now he wont
2055120 we believe the charges have no merit and that when all the facts are made known he will be found not guilty
2055121 the event is an opportunity to celebrate the first year of a babys life as well as the skilled dedicated people who provide services and care to women and their families
2055122 this is a great day for kevin smith fans and we are grateful that the mpaas appeals board was able to overturn what we felt was an unwarranted and overly restrictive rating

2055131 highly entertaining website its been awhile since ive actually laughed at something on the internet i am for sure looking forward to more the links are super organized and easy to navigate very nice job
2055132 this blog shows how to laugh when we forgot the importance of it your blog conveys a lot of message for our life thank good luck
2055133 our passion towards each other and our work has taken over both of us completely in dehradun we have loads of family and everyone is so neighborly this is the place both alok and i return to fine tune our craft in theatre and arts we are drenched with our workshops classes and productions
2055134 plus we understand each others space and mutual interest related to theatre and performing and trust each other completely i dont think i have yet to say to alok you do not love me enough its also where we enjoy nature time spent with family and all the essentials which life in mumbai doesnt allow
2055135 well i think for a woman being a mother is so important to be able to give of yourself completely to your children is gods gift
2055136 well im still feeding ojasya so i havent reduced to my usual size yet i eat healthy foods i love vegetables and fruit and i dont believe in being a glutton i also try to get in some yoga and that is usually on the weekends i think lots of woman start exercising immediately post pregnancy and i feel you have to allow your body a period of rest
2055137 i wanted to give the full shruti to ojasya and not do things half heartedly he is the most important man in my life today and not to sound crazy or anything but i see his eyes light up when im near hes so cute especially when were outside the house or in the garden
2055138 my duty as president requires that i use every means within my power to get the laws the people need to the matters of such importance and urgency
2055139 se lo que hiciste el verano pasado y el otro oto o traspasado y en la libertadores de 1982
2055140 its different having assignments instead of just running down and getting the ballcarrier
2055141 theyre working hard and i hope theyre learning they seem to be
2055142 i thought t j rushing and pierre each had an outstanding return
2055143 that was good to see our special teams get going the way they did
2055144 look at a bunch of tape from last year see where i made maybe one wrong cut maybe shouldve went left and went right
2055145 try to make the game slow down theres just little intricate things you can do to make the game easier for everyone
2055146 imagine walking into your house and not being able to find your kids then you find them in someone elses bedroom
2055147 higher education funding is inextricably tied to the economic well being of the commonwealth
2055148 in all likelihood this pursuit of european companies issue will escalate and i understand could result in wto action focused specifically on how the u s government enforces its laws
2055149 i cannot see how that can be in the interests of this country
2055150 foreign operators who respected congressional intent in 2006 and withdrew from the market while u s companies continue to operate online uninterrupted
2055151 if hes going to be a spokesman on working class issues in the fall hes going to have to get it resolved it aint going away
2055152 lets put it this way if you believe perception rules in politics the fact that it has not been knocked down raises more questions every day then people say why isnt it knocked down if its not there i would not want to necessarily be in the edwards bedroom in the morning you know that is not what i would consider a safe zone
2055153 if he wants to have a role in the convention or any other significant role in the obama campaign or a potential obama administration i think he has to credibly respond to it
2055154 the silence is probably going to accentuate how much that rumor is repeated
2055155 i have great admiration and empathy for edwards and i certainly hope that it all gets cleared up in an acceptable and satisfactory fashion but the reality of politics is that these kind of things do get into the media and they require response
2055156 it would be sort of party suicide to take someone with that kind of scandal and place them up
2055157 at a moment where the democratic advantage partially hinges on not only the public dissatisfaction with the bush administration but also the wide range of scandals over the last three years of the gop it would be unwise for the dnc to prominently position someone who has ethical issues swirling around
2055158 i dont know why we havent talked in forever i miss you

2055171 rmt members have shown the company how they feel by delivering two weekends of rock solid strike action which is in stark contrast to the behaviour of network rail
2055172 we are making progress in bringing this issue to a conclusion and are bitterly disappointed to see the rmt taking further unnecessary strike action in the middle of negotiations
2055173 previous strikes have had no impact on services and we are re assessing our contingency plans so that they are robust enough to cope with this proposed longer strike
2055174 matter of principle we just dont believe in this kind of discrimination
2055175 expressing an anti same sex marriage view if they knew that the teacher couldnt stand to stay at a hotel owned by somebody who opposed same sex marriage
2055176 that would certainly make a statement about gay marriage and would actually be within the jurisdiction so to speak of the aals which is all about law professors not hoteliers
2055177 does this now mean that a member of the legal writing institute or these aals sections who is opposed to same sex marriage is no longer a member in good standing what do you think is the boycott justified or as ribsteins wife http www typepad com t trackback 2506316 32115818 salim hamdan score one for the jury system but the rule of law still needs a big comeback a lexical examination and unscientific survey of expanded clinical experiences in u s law schools becky l jacobs u tenn reevaluating where we stand a comprehensive survey of americas family justice systems
2055178 the agreement at firestone marks a new day for workers throughout liberia
2055179 it is also a crucial victory in the global fight for workers rights
2055180 these brave workers stood up to a powerful transnational corporation and declared that they will no longer be treated like second class citizens or indentured servants
2055181 we were able to sit down at the table with management as equals and to negotiate an agreement that provides our members with hard won respect and dignity
2055182 our victory is shared with our brothers and sisters in the usw who provided vital solidarity and support every step of the way
2055183 his velocity is down 3 6 mph from 06 sanchez is under team control through 09
2055184 his strikeout rate is down but so is his era apparently no team wanted to risk taking on his contract 3 6mm this year 3 6mm in 09
2055185 its a very important distinction between being an ignition source or cause of the fire and being responsible
2055186 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2055187 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2055188 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2055189 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2055190 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2055191 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2055192 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2055193 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2055194 jos diz 8 agosto 2008 s 1 55 pm o atirador que matou o sequestrador acertou em cheio

2055207 probably the most shocking example of how vicarious punishment was practiced in biblical times can be seen in yahwehs command that saul the first king of israel go massacre the amalekites including even children and babies for an offense that had been committed 400 years earlier by the ancestors of the amalekites contemporary to saul 1 samuel 15 1 3 so to the barbaric mindset of the israelites living at that time even four centuries were not too long to exact punishment from the descendants of those who had committed offenses there is no doubt then that vicarious punishment was a cultural belief in biblical times
2055208 the average person is not an expert on health matters if they become acutely unwell or have an accident they cannot be expected to have the skills to decide what triage category they fall into sitting for hours in a stark waiting room couldnt possibly be anyones idea of fun especially the 19 year olds who so we are told have the highest attendance at the department
2055209 dunedin public hospital is a public hospital and it exists to treat sick people if its accident and emergency department cannot safely handle the volume of patients coming through it then it needs more funding to ensure that its facilities and staffing is sufficient for it to do so pure and simple

2055212 mosquitoes spread west nile virus once the virus is found in a bird population we know the mosquitoes are infected and stop testing dead birds in that region for the rest of the season
2055213 if the mosquitoes are infected its a sign that people living in that area are at a greater risk of west nile virus
2055214 reckless in search of cheap fame a caveman resentful of women crusty and out of touch
2055215 i went back and examined the whole day in my head
2055216 hey hey hey look at this are you doing a baseball game today or a modeling assignment
2055217 thats so september 10 is about to take on a new meaning
2055218 if we go every other month it could be a disservice to people trying to get their project up and running
2055219 were not trying to step on anyones toes but we have to meet public safety standards and we dont feel the three lane option would
2055220 even though people have a choice not to wear helmets i wish they would consider the impact to their families and friends when they choose not to wear one
2055221 to blame not wearing a helmet for this accident is ridiculous
2055222 you figure to each their own its their choice for me i wear my helmet
2055223 why would anyone buy drug store items on ebay when they can just go to the store and get these items whenever they want
2055224 if it performs as advertised it would save money and the side benefit is that it would be great for the environment
2055225 it would cost 6 000 to equip two cars and the cost of propane is 2 50 per gallon with a 50 cent rebate per gallon
2055226 we would compare the mileage and see how the cars run for the same amount of time on propane
2055227 i dont think its a tremendous amount of money to give it a shot
2055228 if it performs as advertised it would save money and the side benefit is that it would be great for the environment
2055229 it would cost 6 000 to equip two cars and the cost of propane is 2 50 per gallon with a 50 cent rebate per gallon
2055230 we would compare the mileage and see how the cars run for the same amount of time on propane
2055231 i dont think its a tremendous amount of money to give it a shot
2055232 i think they had a lucky escape one of the coaches was involved in a crash with what appears to be an articulated lorry
2055233 one young person suffering from shock remains in hospital but her injuries are not life threatening she is under observation
2055234 i think they had a lucky escape one of the coaches was involved in a crash with what appears to be an articulated lorry some young people sustained injuries fortunately none of them are life threatening they are cases of broken bones and shock
2055235 they were travelling back to toronto in two coaches they were about 150 miles away
2055236 we have a team of people in the uk speaking to parents and letting them know the majority of the group is ok
2055237 my son is fine he bumped his head falling off his seat
2055238 his injury is indicative of the rest of them bumps and bruises
2055239 there is one young girl more serious than others but we know they are in safe hands
2055240 it appears that the tractor trailer collided with the bus
2055241 they were both pushed on to one side of the road and the bus then partially flipped over and ended up in a ditch
2055242 it was lucky really because it happened only 200 metres from a community centre a lot more people could have been hurt
2055243 the shocking admission that we are unable to identify the origin of nearly half the biofuels used in the uk means that the government cannot assure the british people that the biofuels in their petrol tanks have not destroyed rainforests
2055244 that less than a fifth of the biofuels used fail to meet even minimal environmental standards adds further weight to friends of the earths view that they are a phoney solution to climate change
2055245 the government must put the renewable transport fuels obligation on hold and vote against eu biofuels targets
2055246 anytime we have an opportunity to elevate the discussion get more people interested engaged or talking its a good thing for democracy
2055247 now im just speaking for myself and not the geological survey
2055248 but we are going to need almost anything you can think of all energy sources alternatives and technologies to get us through what paris doesnt talk about is that the electricity to power those hybrid and electric cars is going to have to come from somewhere too
2055249 see what youve done youve got me analyzing paris hiltons thought process
2055250 if she can articulate it it cant be rocket science
2055251 but the candidates dont come out and sum it up this way because their messages are one built around sound bites two built around oversimplification three built around interest groups
2055252 but the average u s household is spending 6 300 a year on fuel costs for their homes and cars thats no laughing matter

2055257 these continue to be challenging times for most casual dining companies including ocharleys inc

2055265 im a huge fan of political diversity whether or not they get a lot of votes american democracy should have a lot of depth
2055266 it is in the interest of the other two major parties to put the green party in a box and say they are only interested in the environment but the green party has taken a stand for reparations and for descendants of the enslaved in this country they have taken a stand against police brutality and racial profiling they have acknowledged the fact that this country was built on genocide of the indigenous people in this country so the green party is also a justice party a peace party a democracy party of course it is a party for respect for this planet that gives us life but that is not all that this party is

2055292 india attracts me it has everything that a human being with the highest possible aspirations can want
2055293 i feel that india s mission is different from that of others india is fitted for the religious supremacy of the world there is no parallel in the world for the process of purification that this country has voluntarily undergone india is less in need of steel weapons it has fought with divine weapons it can still do so other nations have been votaries of brute force india can win all by soul force poets have sung about it and seers have described their experiences

2055317 it would have been a different story if molly williams hadnt been on the ballot
2055318 this new treaty will mean much closer co operation and cut out much of the paperwork which has led to unnecessary delays in the current system and allowed criminals to exploit loopholes and deliberately thwart justice

2055320 we retroactively track any quest achievements or any achievement for an item which is either on your character or in your bank

2055322 whoa ted that seems harsh makes you sound worried and defensive
2055323 we needed one it will finally recognize an amazing decades long growth phenomenon or you could say two growth phenomena both of which are now nationwide
2055324 but then two more trends emerged during the 1970s and began to pick up speed
2055325 one was renewed interest in farm fresh foods like the just picked corn or peaches that americans used to eat at grandmas
2055326 it didnt take long for each group to see it had a vested interest in the other even some communities were quick to realize that a farmers market might also help boost the local economy
2055327 of course thats just the markets themselves its not even close to the number of farmers bringing things to sell or the number of consumers shopping there
2055328 beyond that those market farmers may not include all of the the producers who now are selling directly to grocery stores restaurants and cafeteria systems or marketing their produce from a roadside stand or u pick operation
2055329 those sales translate into a wealth of seasonal bounty on the american dinner table that has to be putting smiles on some faces at the u s centers for disease control and prevention
2055330 the cdc is strongly behind the so called 5 a day program to promote better health
2055331 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2055332 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2055333 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2055334 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2055335 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2055336 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2055337 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2055338 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2055339 judicial opinions in recent years have upheld the notion that requiring a traditional dwelling can pose a hardship to some voters court decisions from a number of states have stated that street corners parks and other public places can be used to establish local voting precincts
2055340 if the number filing for unemployment insurance claims in the next few weeks shows additional gains one could be assured that these claims are indeed indicative of further weakness in hiring
2055341 that said the very fact that the number filing for unemployment benefits under the extended benefit program is advancing is itself indicative that job losses are mounting and the labor market is significantly weak
2055342 then marriage would mean nothing it would mean whatever any foreign jurisdiction says
2055343 the petitioners im sure are headed to a higher court
2055344 we want to advise the public and visiting persons that are coming home for the celebrations to be patient during the week
2055345 there will be a number of sites where there will be a large congregation of the public and there will be instances where there will be traffic control and a lack of parking so we are asking motorists to be patient and carpool when possible
2055346 there is going to be a number of licensed events where alcohol will be served
2055347 well be conducting checkpoints for impaired drivers throughout the weekdays and nights
2055348 we dont want to spoil anyones come home year but the responsibility rests on the driver of the vehicle
2055349 we have also extended our night shifts so that we are working until the early hours of the morning
2055350 local liquor inspector rod taylor is also going to be present during the come home year
2055351 the special events licensed sites like the street dances hell be monitoring those just to ensure that there is enough security he has the authority to shut down those sites if the event gets out of control in any way
2055352 i suspect that many people will be taking boat trips out the harbour during the week
2055353 as they do so they should keep in mind to wear their lifejackets they are also not permitted to have liquor on their boats the liquor laws apply to a boat the same as a car
2055354 perhaps relatives that someone hasnt seen for some time or most families have issues within their own family
2055355 we are sensitive to that if anyone needs assistance with respect to that they can call us

2055357 i am thrilled by this success and the strong support of the olympic family so far of course we want to go much further now the bigger an impact we can make with this campaign the better i am convinced that with our joint efforts we can collect many more items
2055358 i am confident that many of my colleagues will recognise the value of this project and be eager to contribute it really is so easy to participate sport has given a lot to all of us and it is great to be able to give a little back by bringing joy to refugees
2055359 refugee youth have often suffered terribly and witnessed war first hand some refugees are born in camps others grow up in camps which can mean a lifetime with little or no access to sport or recreation the gift of sportswear from olympic athletes around the globe inspires refugees and connects them to the world of sports beyond happiness it brings them hope
2055360 athletes should know about how hiv can be transmitted how it does not transmit and how hiv can be prevented this should help them to educate peers and fight discrimination against people with hiv it really is a topic relevant to sport

2055367 there have been a lot of people from the community who have contacted us asking for a way to present themselves to schedule their departure instead of being arrested
2055368 when i began to doubt my 5 year diagnosis of parkinsons disease i started looking for other ways to think about my symptoms one of my most irritating symptoms is restless legs and sometimes arms i usually thrash around in bed all night the trashed state of the king size bed says it all so when i found night time leg calm oil on the internet for just 14 95 for a one or two month supply i felt it was worth a try when my oil arrived i pumped a little into my hand rubbed it on my tail bone and got into bed to try to take a nap for once i was able to fall asleep i awoke a couple of hours later in exactly the same position the bed was still neat i felt refreshed and realized that i had actually slept and my arms and legs had been so relaxed that i never thrashed around in bed trying to find a reasonable position the comfort of night time leg calm oil continues to make my life better every day sally
2055369 all of this really reinforces the importance for counties to increase their investment in early childhood development now
2055370 if you dont make that investment one of the penalties you pay down the line is that you have kids in school who dont speak english well and whose overall performance lags behind
2055371 could you please put the mission statement on the home page when we send new people to this site if the first thing they see is a bunch of flash counters and blog posts theyre going to leave and never come back thanks

2055392 this new wind farm demonstrates our commitment to dramatically increase the amount of energy we generate from renewable sources helping to cut the uks carbon emissions and secure our energy supplies
2055393 sheringham shoal will be the uks fourth largest wind farm approved to date and will help provide a significant contribution towards our energy targets
2055394 through the planning bill we are also looking to speed up the planning process for developers and improve consultations to make sure wind farms are built in the right places
2055395 how about pixar thatd be a cool name for a company
2055396 but i need to get this price for my house
2055397 but i have a hunch about this price im just feeling good about it
2055398 but i dont want to put any time or money into repairs i just want to sell it like it is
2055399 but we need to get the money out of our improvements
2055400 ok then well wait until next year when the market is better
2055401 this was despicable whoever was behind this was not just trying to cause disruption but clearly was hoping to cause serious injuries
2055402 there is no place for anything like this in our society we dont know which grouping was responsible but im guessing we can only assume dissident republicans may have been responsible as they seem intent on stepping up their campaign of terror
2055403 however we will have to wait to hear what police enquiries find

2055411 we made progress on a number of significant financing and leasing initiatives during the second quarter
2055412 a new unsecured term loan at favorable rates has strengthened our liquidity position and in turn provided additional capital to execute our plan the leases signed with publix at delray marketplace bed bath amp beyond at sunland towne centre and la fitness at south elgin commons demonstrate the high quality of our assets
2055413 with our strategic alliance with z corporation we have expanded our solutions portfolio and we are determined to provide maximum value to our customers based on this association we intend to address other high potential segments like medical packaging metal casting consumer goods architecture education amp research
2055414 the open records act is there to ensure transparency and open government and were quite concerned that the city of el paso and the psb are brazenly ignoring this important law we should have had answers and documents months ago
2055415 were not saying any of it is not public all were saying is give us a chance to put it together
2055416 my pia request is nearly a month old chapter 552 of the government code requires production of the requested material within 10 days or if that is not possible a written certification that it is not possible and the specification of the date and hour when the material will be produced i would politely request that the city and psb immediately comply with these requirements
2055417 if the city will not voluntarily respond the request pls let me know in writing so i can take the steps to compel it to do so
2055418 as i informed you previously the request you submitted asks for voluminous amounts of material and epwu has been diligently gathering the material the delay is unavoidable and in no manner is an illegal action
2055419 as soon as we get a handle on the amount of material and time it is taking we will let you know the costs as a matter of fact epwu has to this point not exercised its option under the pia to demand a prepayment bond from you since we know the costs will exceed normal records preparation costs
2055420 nobody is trying to play hide the ball this stuff is all public information as far as im concerned and as soon as the appropriate internal sections give it to me im giving it to the requestor
2055421 the most important thing is to find this person and to bring some closure to the victim her family and the community any assistance will be greatly appreciated
2055422 i dont like it because i walk and ride my bicycle at 5 30 a m every day for the last three months and its scary
2055423 i think its a good idea anything it takes to get the job done
2055424 at the olympic games the important thing is not winning but taking part what counts in life is not the victory but the struggle the essential thing is not to conquer but to fight well
2055425 you represent the three values of the olympic movement excellence friendship and respect show the kids of the world who will follow you on tv that winning is great but that it is the taking part that counts excellence means sharing your passion with them freely and showing them how men and women of honour and courage behave
2055426 i particularly encourage you also to discover china this fascinating country and its warm and hospitable people who have been looking forward to these games for years
2055427 i cant imagine a woman finding him attractive enough to make a baby with in the first place
2055428 even i got one and im actually a nice person
2055429 our construction team has intimate knowledge of all materials fixtures and processes that are used
2055430 taking over facilities maintenance responsibilities from the property management group was a logical step we ve been able to streamline this process and have seen an immediate improvement in both results and timeliness
2055431 i think that i shall never see a poem lovely as a tree
2055432 the only time to eat diet food is while youre waiting for the steak to cook
2055433 well from our point of view with mario amp sonic having sold so well we dont think there is a problem but actually i think it goes beyond mario amp sonic
2055434 its about taking a specific approach if youre porting a game thats probably not going to do so well both of those platforms have unique capabilities its about thinking about the different ways of exploiting that technology
2055435 and its an rpg and we know rpgs do well on that platform and were partnering with sic bioware the world leader in making rpgs so were crafting that game and experience for that platform likewise when we look at something like madworld we want to take advantage of the wii
2055436 the wii platform is for everyone but that doesnt mean you dumb down the games and that its only casual for moms and dads and little johnny there are also mature audiences with wii and where are the games for them so madworld addresses that i think we maybe understand the platform a bit better than other publishers and thats borne out in our publisher ranking on both wii and ds if you take nintendo out as a first party currently were number three
2055437 some of that criticism is probably warranted we definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as sonic you really have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality and arguably a disproportionate amount of effort
2055438 however i would say we recognize it which is why youre seeing us this year taking the first steps in making sure the quality is right and were constantly looking at innovation we cant just stand still with sonic weve got to be looking at different ways to develop the character different genres and so on
2055439 i think the sonic next gen experience in terms of quality that was relatively early in the next gen cycle when lots of developers were just coming to grips with the technology
2055440 its not a huge surprise when you try to get something out for launch or thereabouts and the quality is not optimal
2055441 this time around with sonic unleashed we got a great new engine the hedgehog engine and that allows us to truly deliver the sonic experience as it arguably should have been on the next gen you know blending classic 2d gameplay with 3d beautiful landscapes rich environments
2055442 so your point about quality is a fair one and its a challenge to sega to make sure were pushing and making sure the quality is there with sonic do we get concerned about it yes of course were always concerned about how were developing that franchise and a lot of time and effort is spent discussing how we develop sonic
2055443 i figure why not drink something with a punch to it like lemonade coffee or diet pepsi if im going to be drinking this way i get my fluids and i get something more
2055444 its exciting at the beginning you dont know how your house will go now you can think about how it will be
2055445 start building and now im thinking about the mortgage im not lying to you at 50 years old and 20 to 25 years years for payments its not easy
2055446 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2055447 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2055448 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
2055449 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
2055450 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds
2055451 this month the private side of some larger than life hollywood stars will be on view as the academy film archive opens its vaults to share home movie footage of luminaries from cary grant and clark gable to ginger rogers and marilyn monroe
2055452 to know its in full affect in your area thats disgusting
2055453 you cant understand that kind of perverseness you just cant relate people say i just dont understand im glad i dont understand
2055454 that little girl is 4 years old if she lives to be 104 that experience will live with her society will be paying the cost of that behavior against that child
2055455 bruce hoffman general transportation manager with the companys distribution center in mount crawford said in a statement
2055456 this program also serves as a great reminder to each of us that children are returning to classes and all drivers need to watch carefully for school buses and schoolchildren
2055457 er is een last van mijn schouders gevallen ik ben me bewust van wat ik heb gedaan en daarom heb ik meegewerkt
2055458 teachers learned very quickly how to coach for the tests but any benefit to be squeezed from the system by such coaching has long since been exhausted
2055459 as test scores have risen educational standards broadly conceived may actually have declined
2055460 we are glad that this matter has come to closure in a way that is good for the team and that is good for brett
2055461 the key has always been we have to act in the long term best interests of the organization and i think every decision that weve made thats been the backdrop
2055462 he was in a difficult situation because we were not going to release him and we werent going to trade him in the division
2055463 those were things he wanted and he wasnt sure whether he wanted to come back here so i think the opportunity to perhaps have a marketing relationship with us was attractive but ultimately he decided he wanted to play but not for green bay
2055464 all the communication throughout all this process i was never truly convinced that he was going to play
2055465 now he wants to play he should play we got to a tough spot
2055466 brett didnt think that he could play here in green bay based on everything that has happened and we came to an agreement to resolve the situation
2055467 they did a great job of selling themselves and selling the opportunity to brett and that group and we felt like that was the best thing for us and we thought that it was a good thing for him

2055730 potentially worse for bugaboo creek than the loss of its ability to entice new customers is the risk that the removal of the signs will communicate as an inaccurate message to its existing customer base drivers on routes 9 and 30 who notice the disappearance of the bugaboo creek sign may reach the reasonable conclusion that the restaurant has gone out of business

2055749 through the olympics people feel they are experiencing their own success
2055750 they believe this is the international community recognizing chinas success over the last 30 years
2055751 china is the country of censorship and this programme is our way of making fun of the chinese authorities who still keep hundreds of journalists and internet users in prison
2055752 its 12 hours before the opening of the olympics a time when we want these voices heard
2055753 its our way of saying to them despite everything you do here are the voices of people you want to silence and they are speaking in the heart of beijing on the very first day of the olympics
2055754 its our way of saying whatever measures you take you will never be able to abolish the right to free speech

2055760 aunque nadie ha podido regresar y hacer un nuevo comienzo
2055761 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2055762 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2055763 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2055764 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2055765 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2055766 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2055767 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2055768 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2055769 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2055770 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2055771 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2055772 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2055773 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2055774 and illustrates that you either dont know us history or prefer not to acknowledge it
2055775 but the firefighting community pulls together really well and there is a lot of support here
2055776 its a very remote location where the chopper went down but today thursday a couple teams of investigators are ramping up to get in there
2055777 once we determined our guys were at a different location we were relieved
2055778 but our hearts and sentiments go out to the families and organizations these guys belong to because this can happen to anyone were in a profession where we can go to work healthy and not come home that night
2055779 even if they are out of state well fly our people out there to meet with them in person
2055780 all of the professionals know to wait until the facts are confirmed before that decision is made as of now they are considered missing
2055781 there is still a lot going on here every afternoon the fire gets active again and is eating away at more wildland
2055782 we are only a very small part of this campaign and the ongoing struggle there will be more protest
2055783 airport security was tight but the equipment i brought in was standard climbing equipment
2055784 we bought the banner in britain and we took it in blank and made it there
2055785 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the licence we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up

2055788 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2055789 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favourites like andoria and qonos
2055790 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
2055791 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
2055792 actually obama does not oppose more nuclear power plants he favors going forward only if it can be done safely
2055793 during the second quarter we continued to execute on our strategy to strengthen our diversified media platform and expand our share of the rapidly growing hispanic population while megatv continued to generate robust growth our overall results were impacted by decreased revenues at our radio group in line with our expectations due to the economic slowdown the advertising environment weakened further during the quarter with key categories seeing reductions in spending as a result we are tightening our cost controls while adjusting our sales and marketing efforts despite difficult near term business conditions we are continuing to build our audiences in the nations largest hispanic markets which bodes well for the future we fully anticipate the recent steps taken to expand the distribution of megatv will lead to a considerable increase in viewership further our investment in programming at our radio platform has provided increased market share and greater penetration among the u s hispanic population we remain committed to capitalizing on our solid content and growing distribution platform to grow our audiences and our share of advertising across our footprint
2055794 but we dont kill all murderers we dont execute all murderers we do it according to the law

2055810 it was right after ivan we had no schools here so i took my kids to canada and put them in school there i was stressed out myself so i rented a harley davidson in calgary i figured this concept would work in cayman basically i just bought some bikes and started the company
2055811 theres a lot of children in cayman that do not have christmas we had my trailer half packed with toys and we gave a lot to the youth centre but the big thrill for me was giving it away in rock hole and being able to play santa claus

2055820 brandon will have a european agent who only deals with european contracts and he will pick a marketing firm that is not connected to the agent who is american based
2055821 ive dealt with various entertainers and talent and in a lot of ways there are similarities here
2055822 the assumption has been for him to play one year but i suppose if there was a multi year deal on the table then it could make sense but ultimately brandon wants to play in the nba
2055823 we have goals that are clearly achievable and within reach but at the same time we want to continue to push forward and stretch

2055847 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2055848 i am not optimistic that any of this can happen
2055849 our priority is going to be on retaining and attracting faculty
2055850 to recruit away the best and brightest minds in the state of florida
2055851 if we want to retain our faculty and staff its really critical that they have regular raises
2055852 you have a lot of unintended consequences that youre putting in the constitution
2055853 weve got students driving around in cadillacs and porches and everything else because they dont have any cost
2055854 no i wouldnt want the ass end of anything in front of me
2055855 no i wouldnt want the ass end of anything in front of me
2055856 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
2055857 it makes me laugh to watch him giggling like some 7 year old
2055858 it reminds me of why i fell in love with him his silly fun side
2055859 we always take goofy photo booth pictures when we go out
2055860 its fun and sometimes illuminating to look back over them for instance the snap we took a few months after our son was born i remember feeling like we werent communicating well but then ill look at that date photo and it shows how much joy and love we were also feeling
2055861 theyre doing an excellent job for me both of them are very consistent in fact theyre 100 percent out to the 25 and then we start trying to struggle a little bit getting a little more power on the ball theyre getting a little better about their techniques hey theyre very accurate on their extra points thats all i can ask of them
2055862 its very difficult because everybody thinks that punting and kicking is so easy but its not
2055863 its all body physics if they make one little mistake with their body it throws the whole thing off its just something they have to develop a very strict habit about in their technique
2055864 in soccer they want the knee over the ball we want it behind the ball
2055865 its not very difficult if they become very disciplined mentally and work on it
2055866 the more reps they get the better it becomes and the more comfortable it becomes
2055867 what they start doing is that they start wanting to come up and watch the football
2055868 no 1 wherever the head goes the bodys going to follow so that takes their follow through away from them it throws their shoulders behind their hips its a habit you just have to break its a natural thing to want to look up and see where the footballs flying

2055871 i feel honoured i will give my full commitment to the work that is done in this wonderful olympic family to promote even more our olympic ideals
2055872 the trend in july was for borrowers to look for longer term mortgages in euro with maximum financing
2055873 borrowers prefer such mortgages on the condition that they can start with smaller payments that would gradually increase in time borrowers rely on the notion that their incomes will continue to grow and when payments start growing then they will be able to cover them or at least renegotiate terms with the lender
2055874 loans of between 30 000 and 50 000 euro had the largest shares of all loans in july
2055875 this is quite accurate since a two bedroom apartment in sofia costs an average of 70 000 euro with banks usually covering about 80 per cent of the price
2055876 in july the number of such clients went down to eight per cent from the previous 18 per cent even though banks raised their interest rates the company said
2055877 we in america have become so desensitized that mounting death tolls and atrocities committed in our name no longer even register to us i agreed to do this video because i no longer wanted to watch i wanted to get up and feel something and share that motivation with others the only reason people are shocked is because im from america and i chose to let it happen
2055878 we were involved with mr matamoros in november 2006 when baton rouge police department asked us to do some investigating concerning life insurance
2055879 and while we were looking at that we noted some other irregularities in insurance activities and once that was noticed we passed our life insurance information on to baton rouge police department and started a parallel investigation involving other irregularities todays arrest is a result of those activities
2055880 this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates

2055882 it is very confusing being so many different sizes in a day
2055883 we are honored to participate in this event every year and provide an incredibly delicious dinner created specifically by chef ron for this special night
2055884 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset
2055885 our mobilator shows people just how much their mobile content is worth for many people mobiles are an extension of their daily lives with personal memories once in a lifetime contact details and the odd sexy text holding huge importance putting a cash value on it all seemed the best way to highlight the value of peoples mobile lives the one thing the mobilator cant put a pound sign on is the emotional attachment to your personal content so the message is clear you should protect what is valuable to you
2055886 if you lose your data then often the loss for the individual is much more than the value of the handset itself in most cases the information lost on a mobile is hardly ever retrieved if a handset is stolen the data loss has proven to be the biggest inconvenience and trauma during a theft as you never know who has your details this takes us into the realm of id theft and fraud
2055887 dont be too concerned because its gonna continue to be here its just gonna be more expensive youre paying more at the pump youre paying more at the grocery store youre gonna pay more to fly but it doesnt mean it wont be there that were gonna lose all our service

2055894 jesus said whoever drinks the water i give him will never thirst indeed the water i give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life it doesnt matter where youre at it doesnt matter what youve done it doesnt matter your age your sex or your station in life jesus said who do you say that i am lifespring is about answering that question and the question of how and why the answer can and does affect your life today

2055897 entendemos que el orden constitucional y el estado democr tico no garantizan en s mismos el respeto de los derechos humanos porque las obligaciones del estado en materia de derechos humanos son obligaciones de resultado por eso parafraseando a claudia acu a periodista de lavaca orgsostenemos como desaf o constante la necesidad de construir nuevas preguntas y nuevas respuestas para estas preguntas desde la promoci n y defensa de los derechos humanos

2056042 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2056043 are you truly supporting senator obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2056044 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee

2056049 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2056050 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2056051 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2056052 i spoke to senator clinton this week shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think we are going to have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2056053 if the party is speaking about unity they the clinton delegates believe the only way to unify the party is actually allowing them to vote
2056054 moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
2056055 they are willing to work with us to make sure we have the opportunity to explore for additional reserves in the eastern gulf
2056056 if they dont need that much protection for their military training activities then im willing to negotiate

2056060 dod has indicated that they are very interested in working out a compromise that will facilitate more domestic energy production
2056061 our impression is that both sides are committed to reaching a workable alternative

2056076 today we are sending the message that those who would seek to defraud our health care system and those who would callously exploit mentally impaired and drug addicted homeless men and women to turn a profit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
2056077 these criminals thought they could get away with this scheme because they figured no one cares about the homeless on skid row they were dead wrong
2056078 at first when i saw all these agents in all their shirts i thought it must be a training exercise

2056132 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2056133 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2056134 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking

2056163 a shut valve in the uss houstons engineering plant has been steadily leaking in guams inner apra harbor since june 2006
2056164 the total amount of radioactivity released into the environment as a result of valve weepage is less than the total amount of radioactivity contained in all of the smoke detectors installed in a typical family home
2056165 we are concerned about this new information and we will do everything we can to ensure the safety and well being of our people
2056166 extensive monitoring in apra harbor has confirmed that u s nuclear powered warship operations have had no discernible effect on the radioactivity in the environment including during the periods prior to during and after houstons most recent departure

2056168 its a disappointing start for usa boxing which always seems to have be filled with its share of turmoil
2056169 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2056170 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to

2056173 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2056174 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got

2056176 yes there was a clash between our men and militants in cawthorn channel today yesterday the militants were in three boats when they sighted the naval patrol team and immediately opened fire on them after fierce gun battle the navy overpowered them and two of their boats were sunk while one was recovered and towed to our base we recovered one general purpose machine gun gpmg and several rounds of ammunition one grenade and a boat

2056179 these past weeks have shown us clearly that senator collins is not concerned with the tone of third party ads so long as they attack tom allen we are now seeing another round of television ads in a campaign that distorts tom allens record while portraying maines working men and women as members of organized crime

2056181 it is understandable that people in maine who have missed out on the nations economic boom might want to artificially increase their incomes through collective bargaining the problem is that unless those jobs are creating added value there is no extra money to go around if the card check bill were to become law and increased the number and clout of unions it would drive up the cost of living for all of us while providing no measurable benefit
2056182 we think this will help end the myth about maine being the highest taxed state in the country we didnt think it was true

2056195 particularly within geographic markets in the united states that have experienced sharp home price declines
2056196 its abundantly clear in this case that the suspects intent was to kill himself and anyone else who got in the way of that goal by taking the officers firearm
2056197 the officer reacted by using his training experience to secure that firearm and prevent his attacker from achieving his goal
2056198 its part of a police officers job but the case illustrates the difficult jobs police officers do every day
2056199 just when you think your assignment to direct traffic is a matter of routine it can quickly become a life or death struggle as it did in this case

2056206 theres just no way were going to afford it if we didnt secure some kind of property
2056207 it was 10 to 12 degrees cooler on the heat index and obviously the players could feel that
2056208 i thought they controlled our offensive line throughout the day we did a considerable amount of short yardage and goal line work and our defensive front controlled the offensive front which is encouraging
2056209 it will be interesting to see how the players react in the scrimmage
2056210 we have three or four young guys that have a chance to compete and play some in the first game if they progress and stay healthy and hold up to the physical demand well see how those guys do with the pressure on them

2056226 are you willing to stand up and support us as we go forward
2056227 they dont want findings it makes waves and draws attention so they avoid those types of things so the higher ups dont come down on them
2056228 the goal is not to save taxpayers money people are really too afraid about what they will have to do to back up their findings so they try to avoid them altogether
2056229 in my opinion the end result was a massive bloated soulless bureaucracy that totally lost touch with the taxpayer
2056230 in the end defense contractors big and small are getting away with murder because they know we at dcaa are slaves to the metrics

2056240 o king we were plunged in the depths of ignorance and we were idolaters we used to eat corpses to commit abominations to severe blood ties to neglect our duties of hospitality and neighbourliness and to use only the law of the strong that was our life until allah raised among us a man whose lineage truthfulness honesty and purity we knew he called us to the oneness of allah and taught us not to associate anything with him he forbade us the worship of idols and enjoined us to speak the truth to be faithful to our trusts to be merciful and to regard the rights of the neighbours as well as kith and kin and to refrain from crimes and bloodshed he prohibited us from committing abominations speaking lies devouring the property of orphans and vilifying chaste women he commanded us to offer prayers to render alms and to observe fasts we have allowed what he has allowed and have prohibited what he has prohibited for this reason our people attacked us and persecuted us in order to force us to abandon the worship of allah and return to the worship of idols and to regard as lawful the evil deeds we once committed when they had tortured and encircled our lives until finding no safety among them we have come to your country and hope you will protect us from oppression while we are with you o king

2056288 the government has yet to provide reasons why the three were detained
2056289 reports have suggested that jasiharan and valarmathy were detained due to their connections to tissainayagam journalists and others who are vocal critics of the government are often accused of having links with the ltte and branded as traitors and terrorists

2056324 youre running for president of the u s and you run down the country to a 7 year old
2056325 senator obama you recently were asked why you wanted to be the president of the united states and your reply was
2056326 your wife however stated that this was the first time in her entire adult life that she was truly proud to be an american
2056327 could you tell the voters which position you now take
2056328 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back always ineffectiveness concerning all acts of initiative and creation there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way whatever you do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
2056329 can someone give me the link to that video hillary put out a few days ago in ca i would greatly appreciate it
2056330 400 e mails sent today that the hillary movement is very small this was on ko tonight
2056331 i would actually prefer it if he didnt speak at the convention
2056332 ms goodman ms goodman are you out there come in ms goodman
2056333 is america becoming fascist the similarities between american fascism and particularly the national socialist precedent both historical and theoretical are remarkable fascism is home it is here to stay and it better be countered with all the intellectual resources at our disposal
2056334 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2056335 you know what felt really good i had my letter notarized by a bo supporter the irony was just too beautiful
2056336 he apparently held and still holds kenyan american dual nationality but has scrupulously avoided any discussion of his
2056337 did anyone see a clip of one of os question answer appearance tonight a little girl asked him why he wanted to be president
2056338 whether stanley dunham pushed for the shotgun union of his daughter apparently unaware that the marriage would be void uner hawaii law is unknown
2056339 the fact that both if obamas parents abandoned him is important to understanding the development f his
2056340 obama has never felt comfortable showing public admiration or affection for his white relatives
2056341 barack obama has often referred to himself as being raised by a
2056342 the idea of having simultaneous pro hillary events in different cities on the same day as the convention is a good one
2056343 mzebest were 2 of a kind are you coming to denver
2056344 while hes in our churches slapping hands and tapping his feet
2056345 the final ads of this race seem more like a hail mary than a long well thought out plan of attack
2056346 usually ads as immediately acerbic as these do not play well
2056347 so i guess i am one of those angry white gun toting bible carrying women the bo camp fears
2056348 when his father left him obamas white grandparents stepped in to fill the void
2056349 dear ms white thank you for contacting me about energy exploration off our coastlines it was good to hear from you since the passage of the outer continental shelf lands act in 1952 the federal government has had the power to lease the underwater terrain extending for 200 miles beyond the states jurisdiction of three miles energy companies have explored and leased only some of these lands since that time to drill for fossil fuels due to environmental concerns however congress limited energy exploitation of the outer continental shelf to clearly defined areas in the gulf of mexico and off alaskas coast affirming a moratorium on the expansion of drilling outside those areas every year between 1982 and 2006 president george h w bush supported this moratorium ordering its extension until the year 2000 and president clinton extended that order through 2012 throughout my senate tenure i have opposed efforts to lift these moratoria on drilling outside of limited areas off alaska and the gulf of mexico we need a sensible comprehensive new energy policy that steers us away from traditional fossil fuels and toward energy independence like you i am deeply concerned about record high energy prices and our continuing dependence on foreign oil and i favor bringing more american sources of petroleum and natural gas to market in order to keep the cost of gasoline and energy intensive products like fertilizer down at the end of the 109th congress a bill to open additional drilling in the gulf of mexico was attached to must pass legislation and passed into law while i voted for this legislation because it included provisions crucial to washingtons working families such as deductions for state sales tax i remain concerned that the oil drilling provisions largely benefited a few states rather than the national treasury by providing 37 5 of revenues from new leasing to nearby gulf coast states please know that as we move forward in the 110th congress i will continue to work to see that our country achieves energy independence i will keep your thoughts in mind as congress deals with this and similar issues if you would like to know more about my work in the senate please feel free to sign up for my weekly updates at thank you for contacting me about this important issue and please keep in touch i hope all is well in asotin

2056351 communities are terrorized by ice immigration and customs enforcement immigration raids
2056352 on behalf of the 26 000 members of the federal law enforcement officers association fleoa i take great exception to your disparaging remark communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids
2056353 while the dedicated men and women of ice endeavor to carry out their dangerous and noble missions you somehow felt compelled to characterize their efforts as something akin to terrorizing
2056354 its one thing to remark intelligently on the need for immigration reform but its quite another to berate ice law enforcement officers who are risking their lives to enforce the laws passed by congress
2056355 your bi partisan fumble should not translate into labeling our members as terrorists by implication
2056356 ice employs patriotic men and women who are outstanding law enforcement officers not rampaging home wreckers
2056357 that those carrying the ice shield are heroes and not terrorists
2056358 i need a good searcher on web for flights to denver from philly i have no patience
2056359 worst of all in his obamas letter to the credentials committee arguing in favor of full votes for the two delegations he writes democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction these words tacitly argue for acceptance of the popular vote results in those states obama cannot see one step ahead for adding them to the vote count would give the democratic primary season popular vote majority to hillary there are about three weeks to the delegate voting things can still happen or even as sometimes suspected with the clintons be made to happen
2056360 dreams from my father a story of race and inheritance
2056361 the audacity of hope thoughts on reclaiming the american dream
2056362 i always wanted the dnc to move left but as old new lefty i forgot about the stalanist tendencies of the left i wonder why all of the obama acolytes so distain an open convention after all 18 million of us did vote for senator clinton
2056363 why did i start running for president i got hit on the head with a rock
2056364 when i woke up id made my announcement and then it was too late no im teasing
2056365 im running for president because ive got two daughters just like you

2056369 it was a gross breach of trust to your employer who is a businessman relying on the good faith of his staff and on the custom his customers bring him
2056370 one doesnt know how badly his business will be affected or if some people will choose to go elsewhere for their petrol
2056371 even though you had the wherewithal the false passport to spirit yourself away from the jurisdiction you handed yourself in to the police and made the investigation easier you made a clean breast of what youd done
2056372 it was a huge fraud and your involvement in it was brought to an end by yourself after a relatively short period of time
2056373 its almost as if they take pride in being ignorant
2056374 eliza youre young smart and you have so much potential you have the world waiting for you you just get carried away sometimes i believe in you youre going to be great
2056375 probably the most difficult budget weve had in two decades mostly due to things you would anticipate high fuel costs were all experiencing and the downturn in the economy
2056376 we face the toughest budget year that the city has had in about two decades and clearly were going to have to set some priorities what are vital city services and what are some things we can do without this year

2056380 vad jag kommer ju fr n medelklassbakgrund jag k nner mig inte disadvantaged
2056381 it will show a lot if they were doing some sort of ac tion
2056382 our recent strong momentum in the business and our positioning in the area of performance based advertising which has shown itself to be robust in the current climate has encouraged us to consider opportunities to accelerate our growth
2056383 right from the beginning our vision for tvs scooty brand has been to empower women and endow them with independence and self sufficiency
2056384 our women on wheels program that is being executed in 90 cities across the country wherein a 400 strong specially trained field force attached to the company dealerships conduct road safety seminars cum workshops and a unique 6 day familiarisation program on how to ride a scooty this is complemented with distribution of educational material on road safety the launch of the electric scooty earlier this year was another step to providing teenagers an opportunity to be self reliant and look at life from a whole new perspective this product is again the result of committed and consistent innovation of the tvs scooty brand
2056385 thirteen celebrants will marry 33 couples which is the largest number of weddings the registry has ever hosted on one day
2056386 its double the number last year where we had 17 couples marry on 7 07 07
2056387 i think there is a lot of people who consider the number eight to be very lucky prosperous wealthy and of course its easy to remember
2056388 its special for us and we hope its a lucky day for us
2056389 we just wanted to marry on the eighth of the eighth month in 2008
2056390 we think its going to be absolutely gi normous for us
2056391 these will be basic tools that we would use for any emergency
2056392 being able to get all of this equipment and all the training to learn how to operate it has just been a phenomenal asset
2056393 thats going to affect wisconsin in our ability to complete some projects that have been ongoing for a number of years and to start some new projects that are needs and are priorities throughout the state
2056394 the ability for emergency responders to come on that scene and to communicate immediately is critical
2056395 we wanted to use these funds this year to help local communities connect to a proposed state wide system
2056396 with a 14 percent cut there are simply fewer funds to help local communities to connect to a state wide system
2056397 it having the equipment benefits not just madison but it benefits this whole area i think
2056398 the interstate backup showed that thats a very high priority and we have to do whatever we have to do in the state to make sure it doesnt happen again and so obviously we hoped that we had as much federal money as we can get but if not were going to have to do it as a state
2056399 the balls not in anybody at rares court really it is squarely in the license holders courts its a shame it is kind of locked in this no mans land there is nothing on live arcade there is nothing on wii

2056401 its too early to say we could use sputnik as a weapon against big viruses or to modify them
2056402 but phages are used to modify bacteria so why not
2056403 what is interesting here is that sputnik is doing this at the expense of the bigger virus
2056404 this was an isolated incident that occurred in a single room at our quarantine facility and no other primates were affected
2056405 the death of these primates is a terrible and unfortunate tragedy
2056406 increased level of extremist activity targeting individuals involved in biomedical research
2056407 the usda notified us that it had opened an investigation in response to our complaint
2056408 nothing of this nature has ever occurred at any charles river facility in our more than 60 year history
2056409 as a result corrective measures were identified implemented and tested
2056410 these preventive measures provide for multiple redundancies that will preclude the recurrence of a similar event
2056411 specifically we have enhanced security and training policies and we have implemented new state of the art alarm systems
2056412 commitment to humane care and the regulatory guidelines that govern our work
2056413 charles river in general as a corporation has a bad reputation as far as animal abuse goes
2056414 thirty two monkeys is a lot and why on earth werent they removed before they died from the heat
2056415 i dont know how long you can hide behind the word accident when these things happen
2056416 obviously business is not being taken care of at the sparks lab
2056417 a message for the next president of the united states
2056418 a crisp and substantial remix of the major memes of the last decade or so
2056419 stations like ktsf do a disservice to the asian american market as they niche asian communities and then pitch programming in their languages to me thats horribly uninspired
2056420 i am a firm believer that there is room for an english asian pop culture channel
2056421 little by little the idea of freedom independence and equality was spread
2056422 it seems to me that the missions work in bulgaria has already greatly benefited the whole nation
2056423 we hope you enjoy the books and the town of union
2056424 that project is on hold because of budgetary constraints on the state
2056425 were just at the point that we feel like someone could get hurt that urges us to get something done
2056426 the ocala attorneys for the owners are dealing with the city to resolve all matters
2056427 the tax repeal would give every massachusetts worker a 5 3 after tax pay raise or about 3 700 extra income per worker
2056428 is to force the state legislators to start cutting the bloated state budget
2056429 the idea here is to stop being on the defensive in fighting against big government and to start taking the political offensive
2056430 government says it has barely enough for necessities too many tax dollars are tied up in waste and luxuries
2056431 as he gets older i think he will appreciate being here more and more the longer people stay at this club you tend to not want to leave
2056432 rio ferdinand is an obvious example of that but really im just pleased we have managed to put all this real madrid stuff to bed they know what they are dealing with now
2056433 the conditions were average this morning but the swell had got better by the time i paddled out and i was able to catch a couple of good waves its my third time here and i usually feel good in newquay so i will take it heat by heat
2056434 i am here for the whole leg and hope i can get points and dollars
2056435 i want to enjoy and keep the pressure away so i will be relaxed and hoping for this wet weather to change as long as we have waves it will be fun
2056436 denver has been a city for so long that has prided itself on being sustainable and becoming green that we said from the beginning we would have the greenest convention
2056437 the whole thing about green thats very different now than it was even a few years ago is it is not something that happens at the end of the day its something that gets designed into what you do
2056438 you know denver already is greener than minneapolis st paul so i think its likely that we will have the greener convention
2056439 every light and microphone thats gonna be turned on at the convention centers gonna be powered by either wind or solar energy
2056440 we are energy efficient with regards to our office with regard to electric strips where we can turn things off and not lose power
2056441 we care about this issue and getting our folks motivated to not only be green but also get out and vote
2056442 with the development in brunei negotiators would now be working on finalising the text of the agreement which is targeted for signing on the sidelines of the asean india summit in december
2056443 when looked at in its totality obviously the bill is aimed at addressing loudness and lewdness of this music as well
2056444 the standard associated with that service could never be music being played in a manner that is unacceptable in society as a whole
2056445 if we are to seriously address this problem we obviously have to deal with it in the absolutist sense we have to make the legislation absolute
2056446 or else we would be passing this legislation in vain
2056447 if u dont like ma music get out de bus
2056448 hmmm im bored shitless so id better go out and kill someone
2056449 e one has benefitted from a strong order intake over the past several months and our backlog is robust
2056450 recent operational efficiency improvements have allowed us to consolidate many of the operations and return to a single shift operation
2056451 most of the folks that are coming in are filing for unemployment and want to know what jobs are out there
2056452 i think employers realize the quality of employees we had at e one
2056453 were hoping that well be able to meet whatever needs they have to support them
2056454 i think were going to be able to offer a lot of options to people affected right now weve got a good plan in place
2056455 these workers have a very deep knowledge base theyre skilled
2056456 what matters to me is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2056457 we got the deal back on track it wasnt a spur of the moment willy nilly i can frolic in canada
2056458 one objective is to drive people to our broadcasts but the other is to satisfy the interest and the appetite of the olympic fan who simply cant get enough
2056459 we thought about making the experience as simple as engaging and dynamic as possible
2056460 a turning point in the way that people experience live events and sports in particular online
2056461 definitely its a big pr stunt for microsoft to be able to claim an event like this
2056462 it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone
2056463 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair colour
2056464 it is as stupid as is fuelwatch the proposed petrol price register
2056465 telling australians what the price of baked beans was a month ago and putting it on the internet is not going to do anything to bring the price of groceries down
2056466 and mr rudd needs to focus on the real issues that are worrying australians every day
2056467 everything that is feasible and humanly possible to address this situation
2056468 to protect freedom of expression freedom of religion and freedom of opinion in your country including tibet

2056472 lentramat de fundacions p bliques i parap bliques de la generalitat s n una verdadera administraci paral lela i incontrolada al servei del pp
2056473 segons es despr n dels comptes generals del 2007 les fundacions p bliques creades per la generalitat s n una aut ntica administraci paral lela de la generalitat incontrolada al servei dinteressos privats o propagand stics i moltes delles no justifiquen la seua exist ncia ni pels seus fins ni per la seua activitat actualment les fundacions auditades aconsegueixen la xifra de 31 fundacions a les que cal sumar aquelles que no consten en els comptes generals per no tindre lobligaci per que formen part de la xarxa del consell com s el cas la fundaci de la solidaritat i el voluntariat
2056474 sorpr n a m s que altres fundacions destinen percentatges molt alts de gastos de personal com la fundaci de drets humans que pot estar justificada per la seua recent creaci per no la fundaci valenciana de la qualitat o la fundaci valenciana per a la qualitat educativa lactivitat de la qual s b sicament el sosteniment de llocs de treball dassessors del pp i el propi manteniment de la fundaci
2056475 segurament va afegir la diputada no realitza cap activitat perqu en cas de fer alguna cosa els seus informes acompanyarien els informes cr tics a la gesti del consell com els realitzats per la sindicatura de comptes i la sindicatura de greuges
2056476 they came with pistols and told us not to move and not to talk
2056477 were very afraid it happened to us before so it could happen again
2056478 the communist party doesnt believe in anything not in god nor ghosts nor spirits so why are they so afraid of a picture
2056479 in my heart the dalai lama is as precious as the stars and the moon in the sky
2056480 without him the world would be dark im willing to give up my life for him
2056481 the government handed out a survey asking people to choose between a dalai lama is good and b dalai lama is bad many returned it blank
2056482 its hard to choose if we choose a we get into trouble with the government but we cant choose b because hes great
2056483 the party secretary of the county came and called for a meeting he said life is so good and you still rioted its your own fault i dont agree we have our own thoughts all tibetans want our own country
2056484 we are the victims of the dalai lamas campaign and the western media
2056485 the police have got everything in hand they will shut the footpath so no one will be able to get into the site and if they do they will be arrested
2056486 i got up on sunday morning and there were 16 hypodermic needles at the bottom of my garden i phoned the police
2056487 youve been visited by peter hains finest start buying the morning star now or well wring out the grease from our hair onto your front lawn p s viva stalin
2056488 they just got engaged it happened within the past few days
2056489 theyre really sweet they basically havent been apart for more than three seconds in the past two months
2056490 why should kids under the age of 2 fly free on airplanes
2056491 this looks like what card players would call a stacked deck
2056492 after going round after round on one of our militarys most important and critically needed procurements this draft rfp changes the rules of the game in overtime
2056493 while it will take time to analyze this document there are several issues that already raise red flags
2056494 for example the draft rfp and pentagon officials have said that the pentagon is going to give extra credit to fuel offload but has not specified how much
2056495 unimaginable that the government would launch a 40 billion procurement with final proposals due in 45 days
2056496 im doing cartwheels knowing this stupid jew bitch is getting her self esteem raped
2056497 thats so september 10 is about to take on a new meaning
2056498 todos los jefes de esa agencia a excepci n del mayor tejeda quien fue relevado hace mes y medio todos han ido all a cobrar peaje del narcotr fico
2056499 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2056500 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2056501 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2056502 its not our fault he sounds like the anti christ from the left behind series
2056503 no this is an innocent humorous ad about him being a new messiah
2056504 lets talk lets chat i am in it to win it
2056505 clinton is also annoyed that obama has yet to deliver on his end of an informal bargain reached as part of their truce that each would raise 500 000 for the other
2056506 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2056507 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2056508 mayor gavin newsoms fiancee registered into the american independent party when this was noticed the mayor said his fiancee had intended to register as an independent the american independent party is the california affiliate of the constitution party
2056509 i look forward to working with president obama on these important challenges working to rebuild a government that once again works for the people follows the rule of law and respects the constitution
2056510 hillary you are the only one i see in the
2056511 your 18 million cracks are here and waiting for you hillary
2056512 after a surprising change of mind and hearts of superdelegates hillary clinton gets the democratic nomination
2056513 answer i am so pleased that senator obama shares my commitment to universal health care
2056514 most of obamas lemmings are whiners and political babies who dont understand history cant appreciate the hypocrisy of themselves and their candidate and believe the world revolves around them and their candidate and anyone who disagrees in the slightest is either a racist or an anti american and obsolete their arrogance will make them miserable in their personal lives because reality is far different from the delusional world they have created for themselves this past year
2056515 question 9 are you truly supporting senator obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to by jr4hill at 8 7 2008 12 46 53 pm answer let me first say i am so grateful for all the support that i have received to answer your question i am completely committed to helping senator obama become the next president of the united states and urging all of you to do the same we share a commitment to universal healthcare bringing an end to the war in iraq and getting back to an economy that works for working families again i believe so strongly that if we want to see real progress in our country and finally break away from the failed policies of the past eight years we need a democrat in the white house i am going to continue to do whatever i can to help senator obama and democrats across the country win in the november by senator clinton at 8 7 2008 1 15 38 pm
2056516 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
2056517 and thank you again for all your support i cant tell you enough how much i appreciate all that you do for me im hitting the campaign trail tomorrow in nevada for senator obama stay tuned and lets stay in touch by senator clinton at 8 7 2008 1 27 12 pm
2056518 if you read between the lines she is saying keep up the great work while spouting the usual party line
2056519 and thank you again for all your support i cant tell you enough how much i appreciate all that you do for me
2056520 maybe weve overload the server lol what did the caller say last night about today being all about the numbers
2056521 senator clinton we are asking that you un suspend your campaign
2056522 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2056523 i think obama should be allowed to stew in his own juices
2056524 if you cant lead then get out of the way
2056525 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2056526 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2056527 i have said repeatedly that i will do whatever sen obama asks me to do
2056528 i am really focused and enjoying being back in the senate and working on behalf of my new york constituents
2056529 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
2056530 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
2056531 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
2056532 this is exactly what i keep asking has he been authenticated
2056533 we are in the final laps why quit now what do we have to lose a stolen election
2056534 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment this is our time with an eye toward the future with resolve in our hearts let us remember this history and answer our destiny and remake the world once again
2056535 when he was 12 years old they found him in the temple in the city of chicago arguing the finer points of community organization with the prophet jeremiah and the elders
2056536 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
2056537 you represent the lunatic fringe and im rather tired of having my email cluttered with your frantic ravings
2056538 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2056539 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2056540 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out

2056555 the reference to a limit on annual assessment of real property is at best ambiguous likely to mislead some voters into thinking that it refers only to assessments for school funding and leaves others guessing as to the true reach
2056556 the amendment would not only eliminate the state requires school property tax but would also cut in half the maximum millage available to local government for funding school purposes the amendment would also cut in half the annual maximum increase in assessments by which local government could fund non school purposes and would limit the subject mater of laws granting future exemptions these are major changes in floridas organic law

2056570 consumers will be very tight fisted in the coming months
2056571 nothing shuts down the consumer and the economy like the loss of a job
2056572 the job market isnt strong right now as we work through the downturn in housing and high energy prices we would like to see more job creation
2056573 however in early democracies as in american democracy at the time of its birth all individual human rights were granted because man is gods creature that is freedom was given to the individual conditionally in the assumption of his constant religious responsibility such was the heritage of the preceding thousand years two hundred or even fifty years ago it would have seemed quite impossible in america that an individual could be granted boundless freedom simply for the satisfaction of his instincts or whims subsequently however all such limitations were discarded everywhere in the west a total liberation occurred from the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice mans sense of responsibility to god and society grew dimmer and dimmer in the past decades the legalistically selfish aspect of western approach and thinking has reached its final dimension and the world wound up in a harsh spiritual crisis and a political impasse all the glorified technological achievements of progress including the conquest of outer space do not redeem the twentieth centurys moral poverty which no one could imagine even as late as in the nineteenth century
2056574 you have to respect his decision its a decision we have to accept
2056575 he was free to do what he wanted and its a shame that he isnt coming to us because hes a player who would really have improved this great group

2056581 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively
2056582 and best of all whenever he slips up the media is there to make an exception for him

2056640 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president

2057057 a visual survey of a majority of the obama offices around the state reveals that they are nothing more than an assortment of vacant spaces offices for other candidates and county party headquarters
2057058 barack obamas campaign for change has 17 field offices open in addition to our headquarters in indianapolis each of those offices have numerous grassroots activities going on throughout the week and are staffed by campaign workers and volunteers seven days a week in addition to that we have dozens of grassroots activities going on in communities where we dont have offices including many of the more than 100 cookouts for change held since last sunday by local supporters to give others in the community the chance to find out how they can get engaged in the campaign and help deliver indiana for barack obama on nov 4

2057061 thanks to icrisat water shortage in our village belongs to the past
2057062 we have enough water but the villages that did not pick up the innovations are suffering
2057063 the productivity in kothapally has increased immensely due to the water saving systems but also because of icrisats improved crop varieties integrated pest management and the judicious application of fertilizers i was one of the first farmers to adopt these ideas and today i can send my five grandchildren to good schools in town
2057064 ten years ago our groundwater level was about 300 feet deep and today we are at about 60 feet thanks to the water saving facilities that we built together with our partners from icrisat even with a late monsoon we have sufficient drinking and irrigation water

2057066 more about critiquing the dancers than about helping them get to the next level
2057067 some of that criticism is probably warranted we definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as sonic you really have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality and arguably a disproportionate amount of effort however i would say we recognize it which is why youre seeing us this year taking the first steps in making sure the quality is right and were constantly looking at innovation we cant just stand still with sonic weve got to be looking at different ways to develop the character different genres and so on
2057068 so your point about quality is a fair one and its a challenge to sega to make sure were pushing and making sure the quality is there with
2057069 i think the sonic next gen experience in terms of quality that was relatively early in the next gen cycle when lots of developers were just coming to grips with the technology its not a huge surprise when you try to get something out for launch or thereabouts and the quality is not optimal
2057070 through this support the technology strategy board is helping to bring together the u k s world class expertise to research and develop innovative technologies in a key area for the u k

2057131 this new museum will continue cades tradition by telling the stories of people who created the inventions and innovations that continue to change our lives today as a way of inspiring each of us to achieve our individual potential in the future
2057132 we wanted the museum to be seen as gainesvilles museum and we wanted it to be seen as a real partner in the revitalization of the community
2057133 it seemed like a real anchor or resource needed to be out there in that direction to really pull the community
2057134 depot park for all thats been talked about and hoped for is truly going to be a first class innovative creative wonderful open community space
2057135 the leaders for this community a while ago had a very innovative idea which was to have an area where community storm water could be located
2057136 layered on top of that are improvements to the park a first class family and state of the art phenomenal museum plus the nearby rts station rail trails and cotton club
2057137 i think you can really get a great sense as to why this kind of building here can do so much for this community
2057138 were totally in support of anything like that that would recognize the accomplishments of dr cade its something that certainly the whole community ought to be able to share
2057139 i hope this does nothing but reinforce the timeline that the cra and the city commission approved a few months ago
2057140 this is a phenomenal opportunity for the city and we should do everything to ensure that this gets built and the contamination gets remediated
2057141 yeah its a concern but im hopeful that collectively well be able to address it
2057142 we have been assured by the city that their completion plan will be in concert with ours
2057143 my father is probably best known for inventing gatorade but his greatest thrill came from inspiring and mentoring others from all walks of life

2057145 we are very thrilled to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv the whole team is devoted to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
2057146 they took us up to their part of town mile end where they live we had bagels and coffee on the church steps it was really cool we went to some bar this european community centre and watched football during the world cup
2057147 we talked to regine and win butler about life and touring it was really cool
2057148 if their testimony is reliable enough to support muhammads integrity then the unbelievers are also a good enough source to call his character into question
2057149 the issue here is not whether what the unbelievers said was correct but whether the muslim assertion that even the disbelievers praised muhammads honesty is true
2057150 after all they are the ones appealing to the statements of the disbelievers to prove that muhammad was a trustworthy person
2057151 this contradictory attitude of the disbelievers was the reason why they deserved gods punishment in the end they knew that muhammad p was a truthful person and that he never told a lie however they disbelieved in him and vigorously rejected his message
2057152 nothing is heavier and more hated to people of disbelief than hearing the hadith and its narration with isnad i e chain of transmission
2057153 if i were to inform you that there were horsemen emerging out of the foot of this mountain would you believe me
2057154 there were horsemen emerging out of the foot of this mountain
2057155 destruction to you is it for this you have gathered us
2057156 o abu al hakam what is your opinion about what you heard from muhammad
2057157 we competed with bani abd manaf the prophets subtribe and so we fed as they fed and gave away as they gave away
2057158 we do not belie you but we disbelieve in what you came with
2057159 how could a person who never told a lie about others ever tell a lie about allah
2057160 who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie against allah or saith i have received inspiration when he hath received none or again who saith i can reveal the like of what allah hath revealed
2057161 god provided supernatural verification that these prophets and messengers were speaking on his behalf showing that the claims of the disbelievers were false muhammad on the other hand failed to provide any supernatural confirmation that he was speaking on behalf of god
2057162 all the records that we do have were written by muslims and even these were produced long after muhammads death
2057163 these islamic reports are suspect since muslims have had the tendency of fabricating stories and statements in order to make islams prophet look much better
2057164 truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to paradise and a man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes a truthful person falsehood leads to al fujur i e wickedness evil doing and al fujur wickedness leads to the hell fire and a man may keep on telling lies till he is written before allah a liar
2057165 whoever has the following four characteristics will be a pure hypocrite and whoever has one of the following four characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy unless and until he gives it up 1 whenever he is entrusted he betrays 2 whenever he speaks he tells a lie 3 whenever he makes a covenant he proves treacherous 4 whenever he quarrels he behaves in a very imprudent evil and insulting manner
2057166 by allah had i not been afraid of my companions labelling me a liar i would not have spoken the truth about the prophet
2057167 this is a proof that lying was ugly before them
2057168 by allah if i lied they would never belie me but i was a notable man refraining from lying i knew that the least of it if i lied is that it would be reported about me and transmitted to all people so i did not tell a lie
2057169 it means that if i had not been afraid of my companions reporting my lies to my people and talking about it in my homeland i would have lied to him due to my hatred and animosity against the prophet this indicated that lying is as ugly in jahillyyah as in islam
2057170 scholars agree on permissibility of deceiving the disbelievers in war in any possible way unless this leads to break of a treaty in this case it is unlawful
2057171 scholars agree on permissibility of deceiving the disbelievers in war in any possible way unless this leads to break of a treaty in this case it is unlawful
2057172 we also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to you from us even if he embraced your religion
2057173 o muhammad this is the very first term with which we make peace with you i e you shall return abu jandal to me
2057174 o muslims will i be returned to the pagans though i have come as a muslim dont you see how much i have suffered
2057175 i went to the prophet and said arent you truly the apostle of allah
2057176 quraish sent me to him and islam entered my heart and i said
2057177 i will not break an agreement and i will not detain an emissary go back to them then if there is still in your heart that which is there now you may return
2057178 when one has a covenant with people he must not loosen or strengthen it till its terms comes to an end or he brings it to an end in agreement with them
2057179 whoever guaranteed the safety of a man and then killed him i disavow the killer
2057180 whenever a people violate an agreement the enemy will triumph over them
2057181 allah has already ordained for you the dissolution of your oaths in some cases
2057182 his saying the dissolution of your oaths means dissolving them by expiation
2057183 allah will not call you to account for what is futile in your oaths but he will call you to account for you deliberate oaths for expiation feed ten indigent persons on a scale of the average for the food of your families or clothe them or give a slave his freedom if that is beyond your means fast for three days that is the expiation for the oaths ye have sworn but keep to your oaths thus doth allah make clear to you his sign that ye may be grateful
2057184 by allah and allah willing if i take an oath and later find something else better than that then i do what is better and expiate my oath
2057185 by allah if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family he commits a greater sin in allahs sight than that of dissolving his oath and making expiation for it

2057210 land cover changes alter the near surface weather and climate changes in land surface properties such as albedo roughness length stomatal resistance and leaf area index alter the surface energy balance leading to differences in near surface temperatures this study utilized a newly developed land cover dataset for the eastern united states to examine the influence of historical land cover change on june temperatures and precipitation the new dataset contains representations of the land cover and associated biophysical parameters for 1650 1850 1920 and 1992 capturing the clearing of the forest and the expansion of agriculture over the eastern u s from 1650 to the early twentieth century and the subsequent forest re growth the dataset also includes the inferred distribution of potentially water saturated soils at each time slice for use in the sensitivity tests the regional atmospheric modeling system rams equipped with the land ecosystem atmosphere feedback leaf 2 land surface parameterization was used to simulate the weather of june 1996 using the 1992 1920 1850 and 1650 land cover representations the results suggest that changes in surface roughness and stomatal resistance have caused present day maximum and minimum temperatures in the eastern u s to warm by about 0 3 c and 0 4 c respectively when compared to values in 1650 in contrast the maximum temperatures have remained about the same while the minimums have cooled by about 0 1 c when compared to 1920 little change in precipitation was found

2057287 it was the hardest decision i have ever had to make in boxing but frankie was completely dried out
2057288 frankie has been working his whole boxing career towards the olympic games and he is obviously completely devastated
2057289 whilst the support staff down in macau and i have done everything we could regrettably it is clear that frankie will not make his weight before tomorrow mornings weigh in
2057290 abae will launch an internal investigation into the circumstances leading up to this withdrawal which is a massive blow to our gold medal hopes and to our essential uk sport and lottery funding
2057291 i am very disappointed on behalf of the aba of england who no longer have direct international contact with frankie as he now boxes under the gb programme and the guidance of head coach terry edwards
2057292 frankie has been struggling at the weight all year but we were confident he would get it down he struggled to make the weight at the world championships in november but went on to make history
2057293 it was obvious to me that frankie was empty and i had the thankless task of telling him it was over i felt if i pushed it any further there would have been a serious health risk
2057294 it was the hardest decision i have ever had to make in boxing but frankie was completely dried out it got to the stage where even if he had somehow managed to make weight in time it was going to be detrimental
2057295 i can categorically deny there is anything mysterious or unusual about the circumstances surrounding frankies withdrawal there is bound to be speculation but the simple fact is that these things happen in boxing
2057296 it was very moving for me to know that the christian organizations which were in very close contact with my father are at our side and are helping us perpetuate his memory
2057297 it is a privilege and joy to honor the memory of a wonderful man who was a patriot and loved his people dearly
2057298 his premature death when he succumbed to cancer was a great loss to the country and of course to the christian community
2057299 i like this one because everyone has a chance to win no matter their skill level i travel all around the country playing golf and ocn is one of my favorites because the courses are outstanding service is excellent and they offer great promotions
2057300 the promotion is designed to reward the golfers who play at orange county national on a regular basis during our summer months and to encourage more golfers to come out and play
2057301 the more you come out to orange county national the more chances you have to win summer is a great time to take advantage of great rates on our two championship golf courses or use our award winning practice facility and short course
2057302 i do design work at bristol bar and the owner of bristol bar runs lumiere candle co and is a graduate of ft hayes and im a student at osu so i really wanted to bring together these different aspects of my life in one big event

2057323 as a global company with roots in china and a top worldwide sponsor of the beijing 2008 olympic games it is an honor to have our torch design chosen for the olympic torch relay
2057324 lenovos spirit similar to that of the olympic games themselves is multicultural collaborative and competitive
2057325 inspired by the shape of a traditional chinese scroll the imagery of the cloud of promise represents the traditions of china while the shape texture and technology evoke the olympic spirit
2057326 we approached the design of the torch with the same process we use in designing our personal computers first we explore the connection between the user and the solution we create for them looking at factors like size weight features etc then we encourage the lenovo design team to take a fresh approach to make the product uniquely and friendly to the customer this is what we did with the torch realizing it must be attractive to those who see it and comfortable and light for those who carry it in the case of the torch our customer is both the torchbearer and the spectator

2057351 the athletes need to step up and decide that they want to stop the drug problem in their own sport until they do that its going to be an issue
2057352 if the athletes dont want it doping they cant stop it but they can eliminate a lot of it
2057353 for instance if youre on a relay team the athletes know whos dirty why are you going to run on a relay team that is going to lose a medal in five years
2057354 its up to the athletes to say im not running i know what youre doing i know whats going on if youre on the team im not running if we tell the athletes its okay to say no more were eliminating that but also bringing the competition more fair

2057418 an effective conservation program is helpful on multiple fronts because it lowers individuals energy costs increases overall supplies and does both almost instantly

2057449 after weeks of late night negotiations and under intense u s pressure iraqi lawmakers failed to pass a much debated provincial elections law wednesday before adjourning for the month the failure to pass the law which would govern elections in provinces across the country may push the elections into next year if elections dont happen by the end of this year it could be july before the balloting could be carried out u n spokesman said arikat said
2057450 a special session of parliament sometime during the recess which ends sept 9
2057451 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2057452 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2057453 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2057454 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2057455 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2057456 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2057457 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2057458 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2057459 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2057460 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2057461 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2057462 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2057463 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2057464 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2057465 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2057466 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions
2057467 it is good for their psychological health it is good to take care of the appearance to see the building a new clean
2057468 school kits to iraqi refugee children distribution of uniforms shoes and school materials and is expected to outfit 30 000 children from damascus and rural damascus before the start of the syrian school year on sept 7 last year unhcrs distribution reached 20 000 iraqi children
2057469 its really important that they figure out a way to quickly get that money to those people directly i think theyve made a lot of progress on that but they needed to do more
2057470 notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of armored security vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 206 milliion

2057472 the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of m1a1 and upgrade to m1a1m abrams tanks as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 2 16 billion

2057525 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it but i think sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
2057526 weve seen some research that says 60 percent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again so we have to get the balance right because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes and we have to treat them with respect
2057527 vegetation is an important factor in global climatic variability and plays a key role in the complex interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere this study focuses on the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation and its relationship with land atmosphere interactions the authors have analyzed the vegetation water content vegwc from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e the leaf area index lai the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the land surface temperature ts and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis three regions which have climatically differing characteristics have been selected the north america monsoon system nams region the southern great plains sgp region and the little river watershed in tifton georgia temporal analyses were performed by comparing satellite observations from 2003 and 2004 the introduction of the normalized vegetation water content nvegwc derived as the ratio of vegwc and lai corresponding to the amount of water in individual leaves has been estimated and this yields significant correlation with ndvi and ts the analysis of the nvegwc ndvi relationship in the above listed three regions displays a negative exponential relation and the ts ndvi relationship tvx relationship is inversely proportional the correlation between these variables is higher in arid areas such as the nams region and becomes less correlated in the more humid and more vegetated regions such as the area of eastern georgia a land cover map is used to examine the influence of vegetation types on the vegetation biophysical and surface temperature relationships the regional distribution of vegetation reflects the relationship between the vegetation biological characteristics of water and the growing environment

2057604 take a little piece of string and attach to it a stone begin to rotate this primitive sling under the influence of centrifugal force the stone will try to pull itself away and tightly stretch the rope well what will happen if one fastens such a rope to the earths equator and having flung it far into the cosmos one hangs on it an appropriate load calculations show that if the rope is sufficiently long then centrifugal force will also pull it out not letting it fall to earth just like the stone stretches out our string indeed the earths force of attraction lessens in proportion to the square of the distance and centrifugal force grows with the increase in distance and already at a distance of about 42 000 kilometers centrifugal force turns out to be equal to the force of gravity
2057605 we carried out thousands of multiscale stochastic simulations in order to perform the first in silico tensile tests of cnt based macroscopic cables with varying length
2057606 the longest treated cable is the space elevator megacable but more realistic shorter cables are also considered in our bottom up investigation
2057607 multiscale stochastic simulations for tensile testing of nanotube based macroscopic cables
2057608 thus five hierarchical levels are used to span lengths from that of a single nanotube of about 100 nanometers to that of the space elevator megacable of about 100 000 kilometers
2057609 on the strength of the carbon nanotube based space elevator cable from nanomechanics to megamechanics
2057610 in this paper preliminary simulations were carried out on a small piece of the space elevator cable basically our level 1 results in the current paper postponing a detailed and hierarchical investigation as the main topic of a subsequent that is the present paper
2057611 our simulations imply that the megacable strength is predicted to be much smaller than the theoretical nanotube strength 100 gpa erroneously assumed previously in the space elevator design
2057612 the multiscale simulations suggest a taper ratio the ratio between the maximum cross sectional area at the geosynchronous orbit and the minimum at the earths surface larger than 613 in spite of the current na ve proposal of 1 9
2057613 our predictions are conservative since we have assumed perfect junctions between the nanotubes
2057614 the junctions are expected to be the weakest links even if advanced nanotechnology which doesnt exist yet could lead to nearly perfect interconnects i e junctions with a strength that is larger than that of the nanotubes themselves

2057775 today we have considered several comprehensive and bi partisan bills that go a long way to address the health care needs of our veterans and provide for their necessary and earned benefits i believe that the tireless work of the members of the house veterans affairs committee has provided this congress with strong legislation which will help to improve the lives of our nations veterans i look forward to working with my colleagues in the senate so that we can further increase access and improve health care treatment for our veterans
2057776 one very important provision of the veterans health care policy enhancement act of 2008 addresses vas ability to provide counseling training or mental health services to family members of veterans who are seeking treatment for non service connected disabilities accessing mental health services for family members is particularly important for our newest generation of veterans and their families many of whom are struggling with post traumatic stress disorder and depression
2057777 our nations current commitment in fighting the global war on terror has brought to light the need for h r 4255 as the number of disabled service members has substantially increased over the years it has become necessary to expand available rehabilitative services to ensure these men and women are afforded the best possible care after their service to our country as america looks forward to the olympics this year it is fitting to provide this support to our veterans so they can take part in the paralympic program now and in the future
2057778 when called to duty service members across our nation must leave their loved ones behind along with other responsibilities like school and work unfortunately as we are witnessing today some of these service members are finding it difficult to maintain their job their residential housing or their enrollment at an institute of higher education h r 6225 honors the sacrifice of our service members by providing them with adequate protections so they may have the peace of mind that their interests and their families are protected while serving our nation

2057879 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago
2057880 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule and china more than any other country has enabled the survival of the brutal burmese regime
2057881 vote to nowhere the may 2008 constitutional referendum in burma
2057882 the chinese government and the olympic movement should be ashamed to have a leader from this ruthless regime as an olympic guest
2057883 at the very least beijing should tell the prime minister that its time for political reform in burma as a responsible power china should put the burmese peoples welfare first ahead of profit from business deals and arms sales that only benefit the regime
2057884 burmas rulers have used chinas support as a license to commit atrocities
2057885 concerned governments should focus sustained criticism and targeted sanctions on the military regime so that the people of burma do not endure another 20 years of brutal oppression

2057899 se dadeau burse pentru studentii din anii terminali indiferent de profil in urma aceluiasi test de la recrutarea obisnuita in p amp g test global al capacitatii cognitive plus interviuri
2057900 a fost cumva curiozitatea legata de un alt mediu mi s a paut o oportunitate interesanta nu avusesem pana atunci nicio legatura cu mediul de afaceri care era la inceputurile lui la noi in 1999 iar calculatorul il folosisem de cateva ori
2057901 eram in an terminal si era exclus sa lucrez full time dar au revenit cu varianta part time si am acceptat acea perioada in care am facut ambele lucruri in paralel cred ca a fost definitorie in alegerile mele
2057902 decizia de a ramane a venit firesc pe baza modului in care m am integrat aici fata de cum simteam ca ma integrez in mediul celalalt stomatologia e mai egoista esti tu cu tine deciziile tale echipa e mai mica aici insa am avut norocul sa intru intr o echipa frumoasa
2057903 apoi am intrat full time mi am facut si anul de stagiatura intr un ritm aproape la fel de nebun dar am vrut sa fac tot ce trebuia
2057904 in acest moment oamenii din departament au arii de expertiza in toate aceste zone si in plus din romania coordonam activitati ale altor 7 tari din regiune fiecare cu specificul ei bulgaria serbia muntenegru bosnia si hertegovina macedonia moldova albania
2057905 pana atunci evolutia mea in p amp g a fost destul de liniara si fara dificultati majore dar contextul din serbia e cu totul deosebit in regiune si in europa as zice razboiul a facut ca oamenii sa nu gandeasca planuri pe termen lung si din punctul nostru de vedere asta era o problema
2057906 erau mult mai putine femei in business si societatea e mai traditionalista nu prea le acorda credibilitate desi sunt eleganti in abordare ei se bazeaza mult mai mult pe socializare si au fost chiar momente nostime cand eu sugeram diverse intalniri intr un cadru mai formal iar ceilalti propuneau unul mai informal
2057907 a fost din nou o experienta extrem de interesanta m am mutat intr un context personal dificil iar mediul din anglia extrem de relaxat si asezat m a ajutat mult a fost un echilibru gradul de civilizare si relaxare a fost ce aveam eu nevoie am devenit in mod clar mai calma si toleranta in anume directii
2057908 a fost o decizie extrem de usor de luat din punctul de vedere al principiilor mele pentru ca sunt dispusa sa trec prin experiente diferite dar cred ca pot sa dau cel mai mult in contextul in care am familia si prietenii aproape
2057909 am o echipa mult mai mare inainte aveam 5 oameni acum 12 responsabilitatile sunt altele trebuie sa iei in considerare specificul contextul politic cel mai mult imi place lucrul cu oamenii provocarea mea majora fiind cresterea lor in companie partea aceasta devine din ce in ce mai importanta iar managerii sunt din ce in ce mai mult stimulati in directia grijii accentuate pentru cresterea oamenilor eu ma straduiesc sa fac interactiile foarte frecvente pentru a intelege omul a intelege aspecte personale si a nu creste presiunea in momente dificile
2057910 facultatea nu trebuie sa iti limiteze optiunile mentalitatea a fost ca studiile iti limiteaza optiunile ca trebuie sa faci ceea ce decizi la 18 ani dar in momentul acela nu poti sa spui cu certitudine ce vrei sa faci toata viata studiile iti deschid orizonturi te ajuta sa capeti acea flexibilitate si siguranta de sine care iti permite sa faci alegeri
2057911 cred ca realizarea mea cea mare e ca nu m am incrancenat sa obtin ceva intr un anume interval iar asta e ce mi se pare diferit la generatia de azi care e mai grabita si nerabdatoare noi eram un pic mai dispusi sa dovedim ca meritam sa ajungem undeva acum s a schimbat in bine deschiderea faptul ca tinerii au mai multe optiuni in rau poate ca s a schimbat entuziasmul cu o incrancenare vreau sa le arat ca lucrurile evolueaza firesc daca te concentrezi pe ce iti trebuie nu pe scopul final totul cere timp de fapt ce am urmarit eu este echilibrul pe care ti l da senzatia ca ai facut ce trebuie sa faci
2057912 au fost momente cand am simtit nevoia de explorare aventura locuri exotice si atunci am fost in africa de sud sau republica dominicana dar am avut nevoie si de vacante in care sa nu fac nimic si atunci am ales grecia spania sunt foarte aproape de inima mea locurile exotice foarte departate in care simti ca te rupi complet de lume
2057913 but since im yapping anyway does our good buddy molar juice here run a blog
2057914 i find the content obnoxious and i find the style obnoxious and i find the blogger obnoxious
2057915 i love that because ross closed his comments moes migrated over here

2057917 no no youre darn right about the civility thing ml amp js favorite insult that of the porcine nature is really really irritating but 2 wrongs dont make a right
2057918 no serious person is going to look back on this or any other admistration fondly for at least 20 years after they leave office at which time the vast majority of people will most likely have decided it was something of a mixed bag
2057919 a series of minor f kups punctuated by major catastrophes
2057920 but keep up the juvenile comments i admit that they do serve to shed some light on where the cesspool is in our political culture
2057921 im amazed that a cumulative 150 posts have spit it out yet
2057922 ill say now that the mix will consist of incompetency criminality stupidity war crimes hypocrisy and basically nothing in the way of actual accomplishments that could be the clinton administration except for the accomplishments parts clinton did succeed at forcing us all to use toilets that dont flush properly so thats one feather in his cap
2057923 greenwald is a graduate of a top 5 law school and worked at the most prestigious law firm in the country in 9 months he managed to become one of the most cited and heavily trafficked bloggers on the internet
2057924 whoosh hear that thats the sound the point of ellers post makes as it flies over your head
2057925 it rather depends on how iraq and afghanistan turn out if the long term results are modestly stable and democratic governments in each country
2057926 you seem dead keen on being certain about the future though so perhaps its best if you dont think about it too much
2057927 yeah except for the constitution the democratically elected government the burgeoning strength of iraqi security forces the reduced violence the anbar awakening and the repudiation of al qaeda by the sunni tribes the government turning on shiite militias and those militias surrendering in cities that were their strongholds and so on and so forth you know various minor and inconsequential points
2057928 i bet there was no rape epidemic during the talibans rule everyone knows how well fundamentalist islamic law deals with rape victims sure the taliban may have had a few problems but at least they made the trains run on time h h h they kept those rape statistics down well at least out of sight and out of mind at least
2057929 i believe demolishing husseins military power and liberating iraq would be a cakewalk let me give simple responsible reasons 1 it was a cakewalk last time 2 theyve become much weaker 3 weve become much stronger and 4 now were playing for keeps
2057930 well i dont think its likely to unfold that way
2057931 and there is a good chance that it will be less than that
2057932 support for saddam including within his military organization will collapse at the first whiff of gunpowder
2057933 the iraq fight itself is probably going to go very very fast
2057934 i remember bush stressing that the war on terrorism would be long and hard
2057935 a lot of this hatred of greenwald is just jealousy based on the best selling book and his media appearences along with the success of his blog moelarryandjesus you would not believe how envious his detractors can be
2057936 i remember the scumbag playing dress up and proclaiming mission accomplished whos the idiot
2057937 the white house claimed that the banner was requested by the crew of the ship who did not have the facilities for producing such a banner
2057938 we took care of the production of it we have people to do those things but the navy actually put it up
2057939 the vast majority of casualties among both coalition approximately 96 as of november 2007 and iraqi combatants and among iraqi civilians have occurred after the speech
2057940 a lot of this hatred of greenwald is just jealousy based on the best selling book and his media appearences along with the success of his blog moelarryandjesus you would not believe how envious his detractors can be
2057941 hellooo alternate reality who slaughtered and tortured al qeada and affiliates did sectarian militias did the iraqi government is fighting them wow thats so complicit i cant believe it
2057942 so even if a govermnent goes from totalitarian theocracy to modest democracy but rapes remain the same its not a better place to live right
2057943 just like them oh right in your bds alternate reality i forgot
2057944 most of those quotes seem to pertain to the combat phase the war against saddam hussein and his army rather than the whole nation building phase
2057945 clearly the white house is lying here after all your quote goes on to refute this statement really it does you just cant see the refutation because it is invisible
2057946 not long afterwards the white house had to amend its account
2057947 they the white house put up banners at every event that look just like that and were supposed to believe that at this one it was the navy that requested one
2057948 we have good news for democracy the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against general musharraf
2057949 if he does it it will be his last verdict against the people
2057950 pakistan cannot afford to see democracy derailed this is not the same pakistan as was the case in the 1980s and 1990s people will not accept it now

2058061 i do know that dfis reputation is extremely pro consumer and they bring a ton of regulatory actions against the entities that they regulate because of that my best guess is that they are a making sure the public is informed that mortgages with good rates are still available a lot of news stories make it sound like no one can even get a mortgage anymore and b trying to make sure that our housing market doesnt do what say floridas did if homes really do lose a lot of value in wa then that is really bad news for people who need to refi and people who need to sell their homes for whatever reason and it is just bad news for the economy in wa in general so i think it is more of a stab in the direction of people retaining confidence in the wa market which i dont think is totally misplaced its not a bargain time to buy but if youre someone who has a significant down payment good credit and plan to stay in your home for 10 years i doubt that it is a very risky time to buy

2058075 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2058076 evidence continues to mount that shows that epas current approach to renewable fuels will likely increase global warming pollution and will do almost nothing to lower energy costs or increase energy independence
2058077 administrator johnsons refusal to seize this opportunity to re orient epas flawed biofuel policy is unfortunate and irresponsible
2058078 biofuels are not the solution that corporate agribusiness is making them out to be
2058079 they are worsening global warming and polluting our air water and soil thats why todays epa decision is so important by denying the waiver the epa failed to take advantage of an opportunity to limit this foolishness instead of getting stuck on false solutions what we need to do is use less fuel altogether
2058080 the epa missed an important opportunity to slow down the rush to ethanol before committing the nation to dramatic increases in production
2058081 the energy bill authorized studies of the effects of expanding the renewable fuel standard those studies should be undertaken at once and a sustainability standard established for ethanol production before increasing investments of acreage infrastructure and other resources big picture analysis is needed including ethanols effects on u s energy independence food prices and the environment if the nation is to adopt biofuels in ways that are beneficial rather than destructive

2058175 but a question that we get asked a lot is whether sellers should set the starting price really high really low or somewhere in between the research demonstrates that in most situations its better to make the starting price really low at first this might seem at odds with findings from negotiations research which suggest that as a seller its far better to set the initial value quite high but there are some fundamental differences between typical negotiations and auctions including the fact that in auctions an almost unlimited number of people can choose to get in on the bidding in auctions if the initial price is too high it acts as a barrier to entry so fewer people will place bids

2058217 de ce nu este inteleasa literatura fantastica a lui mircea eliade raspunsul direct ar fi pentru ca aceasta literatura nu seamana cu cea clasica si pentru ca fantasticul ei nu este acelasi cu al basmelor si legendelor populare cunoscut de cititor eliade nu face uz de imaginatie pentru a supradimensiona realitatea ci se pastreaza in datele adevarului numai ca adevarurile pe care le transforma in coduri nu sunt dintre cele pamantene cunoscute de oameni ci adevaruri ceresti pe care oamenii le cunosc prin intermediul literaturii lui

2058258 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign

2058284 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2058285 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2058286 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2058287 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
2058288 we just felt like this was an opportunity to go get somebody of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
2058289 we felt it was in the best interest of the team and when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
2058290 we had discussions with him and his agent bus cook
2058291 and were going into this and were going to take this one year at a time and were excited to have brett on the team this year

2058301 gm is pleased with the settlement and we look forward to it being resolved
2058302 although it has strong defenses to these claims deloitte concluded that it was in the best interests of the firm and its clients to settle this matter now rather than face the burden expense and uncertainty of continued litigation
2058303 the combined settlement of over 300 million is impressive just by its size and also by the fact that we were able to accomplish this is just 2 1 2 years of litigation some of these cases can go on for many years
2058304 at the moment valuations in the us look pretty attractive and thus its the right time for companies to exploit the situation
2058305 though the slowdown will continue for a couple of more quarters it is not going to continue forever thus when the us economy picks up again outsourcing will gain momentum and the companies will see a number business opportunities
2058306 even during a downturn a number of organisations are looking at opportunities to reduce their total cost of ownership and thus they continue to outsource more as the topline of the revenue cycle gets hit during such times companies need to evaluate as to what could be minimized so that profitability could be maintained thus they look out for more outsourcing opportunities

2058357 chiaro che questo un momento di grande debolezza come indicato dalle survey coerenti con una crescita piatta nella migliore delle ipotesi
2058358 loutlook quindi generalmente negativo vediamo un secondo semestre piatto ma a questo punto i rischi sono al ribasso anche perch gli indicatori di luglio continuano a segnalare debolezza e non ci sono miglioramenti in vista
2058359 questo dato negativo apre le porte ad una situazione di recessione tecnica
2058360 se il dato fosse stato negativo dello 0 1 la mia previsione per il 2008 sarebbe stata dello 0 2 ma a questo punto sicuramente peggiore e non vedo aperture per una ripresa a breve tempo
2058361 a questo punto si potr senzaltro parlare di recessione per lo meno secondo la definizione tecnica di due trimestri consecutivi di contrazione del prodotto interno lordo per il terzo trimestre abbiamo infatti unattesa di una caduta di 0 1 dellattivit economica mentre inserendo la stima istat di oggi nel modello statistico per la media danno il risultato di un davvero modesto 0 1 a rischio concreto di crescita zero

2058418 posting a sign that tells consumers which fish they should avoid would let them know that other fish are ok to eat and allay any fears they may have
2058419 in fact some grocery stores that posted the fda advice had no negative effect on their seafood sales and one company even reported that seafood sales increased after posting the signs

2058432 ridecivil promots civility between motorists pedestrians and cyclists we signal and stop smile and wave ride 2 abreast and yeild to pedestrians we wont be corking or blocking traffic just safely cycling our city
2058433 the gelato shouldnt be heaped up and in old fashioned places like this they keep the lids on
2058434 the banana should be pale oatmeal the color of real mashed up bananas never yellow
2058435 but people who love it say its the hardest flavor for gelato makers to get right
2058436 as our third quarter results illustrate difficult operating conditions in the homebuilding industry persist
2058437 based on these demand dynamics coupled with high supply levels of new and existing home inventory we believe industry conditions will remain challenging for the remainder of this fiscal year and as we enter fiscal 2009
2058438 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
2058439 a courageous patriotic american who stands up for what he believes
2058440 the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
2058441 there has been no evidence to suggest that the safety of the children was compromised nor do i believe that any children viewed these images
2058442 i also want to point out that this should not reflect on the hard working professional men and women of this department
2058443 we will address this situation head on any allegation or information that we receive will be looked into
2058444 it looks like the employees involved in this matter were an isolated group
2058445 helping you clean up after an all night blow out
2058446 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2058447 obamas flip flopping has moved him more toward the center
2058448 mccain moved to the right in the primaries to make himself more acceptable to conservatives
2058449 bushs hard headedness and stubbornness people dont care about ideological purity they want problems solved they want a president who can cross the divide and make deals
2058450 priority no 1 is to keep well meaning deserving homeowners who are facing foreclosure in their homes
2058451 he has completely reversed himself and gone back not on his word to me but the commitment he made to the american people
2058452 having a core set of beliefs and a strong point of view
2058453 the question is not whether social conservatives will hold their noses and vote for mccain its will they knock on doors and plant yard signs
2058454 we dont have any faith that he will be consistent on the moral issues we really care about
2058455 putting gov huckabee on your ticket will immediately excite mobilize and activate a key grass roots constituency that is essential to your success
2058456 my fear is that there would be a lot of women and any number is too many who would say i think i will stay home
2058457 obamas political calculation may be correct but it still involves a price it has shattered his claim to be different it calls into question his political character and leaves the impression he is consumed and defined by ambition
2058458 the city needs to be moving forward and its not doing that
2058459 i think he needs to take a leave of absence and assess things
2058460 there is absolutely nothing on the table no plea bargain offers have been made
2058461 she is pushing the envelope she is definitely trying to get him to crack and go out on his own
2058462 i think everyone would have liked him to have been gone at this point
2058463 when you really think about it from 1776 to 2008 men women of all ages colors and creeds died in this country for kwame kilpatrick and you to have the right to a fair trial
2058464 the mayor for the good of detroit and the region should step aside
2058465 take a leave of absence until his legal issues are resolved
2058466 as an attorney i respect the legal process but the mayors legal issues have become more than a distraction
2058467 legal issues have escalated to a point where it is impacting not only the city of detroit but also the state
2058468 mayor kilpatrick needs to step down so the city the region and the state can begin to move forward
2058469 if the mayor is exonerated in court i am confident he will be rewarded by the public for putting the people first during these challenging times
2058470 but even my son at some point would have to learn to abide by the restraints he placed upon himself
2058471 while the mayor should be working himself out of this hes giving others further reasons to bury him
2058472 my prayers are with him i would hope that at some point that he would recognize how serious this is
2058473 but i cant advise him at this point except to say that no job in the world is worth all this hes going to lose his family hes going to lose his law license hes going to lose everything i tried to tell him but he isnt listening to anybody
2058474 diversity is definitely here to stay the way it is right now in our community and in the united states
2058475 we are the melting pot its just hard to manage all of that especially in our school system
2058476 one of the interesting things about migration is that it occurs in streams once it starts it sort of picks up speed and volume over time
2058477 we have a tremendously diverse community and it has gotten more and more diverse for the past 10 years
2058478 you cant expect people to assimilate if theyre not given some kind of information they need to learn the laws somebody needs to keep them informed
2058479 everything comes down to whether they are legal or illegal
2058480 its hard to provide services and plan when you dont know where those numbers are going to settle down to
2058481 we just dont have the support and infrastructure within our society to support the growing needs of the hispanic aging population
2058482 you have to understand the context in which a person lives their relationship to family the housing they need transportation
2058483 people want to solve their own problems even though there is treatment and health care available
2058484 we are trained to be responsible for our parents hasta al final to the very end
2058485 if i ever win the lottery i would construct a nursing home to fill the needs of elderly hispanics
2058486 health and human services are not a discussion that follows economic models
2058487 if you grow up here where we have no majority and theres a complete ethnic mix people have learned how to get along with others who look different and are from different places
2058488 hawaiis spirit of tolerance might not have been perfect or complete but it was and is real
2058489 the opportunity that hawaii offered to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect became an integral part of my world view and a basis for the values that i hold most dear
2058490 he himself is a child of diversity and hawaii gave him that opportunity
2058491 he believes diversity defines you rather than divides you thats the central message of change hes bringing its nothing to be afraid of
2058492 im going to see my grandma who i havent seen in 18 19 months

2058521 all the parties concerned need to cease military action and get back into talks immediately and sort this out through dialogue and negotiation rather than through force of arms along with the devastating immediate consequences of any armed conflict a failure to resolve the situation peacefully would have serious social and economic impacts in the region

2058561 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2058562 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2058563 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2058564 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2058565 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2058566 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election

2058612 our goal was to create a completely convincing animated computer generated face
2058613 given the caliber of creative work and talent in our industry it was a challenging goal but one we were confident we could accomplish by pairing our technology with the facial scanning system developed by paul debevec and his team at ict the unmatched level of detail delivered by icts facial scans perfectly complemented the power and accuracy of image metrics technology to achieve a new level of believability in facial animation
2058614 its exciting to see the results of combining our high resolution face scanning with the animation pipeline image metrics has created
2058615 this collaborative research project means that for the first time were seeing the realism of our face models truly come alive on screen with a pipeline that would be straightforward to apply to future projects
2058616 while we often work with character models developed internally or by our clients icts scanning method is currently the only method capable of acquiring high resolution pore level detail directly from a live subject
2058617 by coupling their system with our own easy to use animation solutions for translating the actors exact performance onto the cg model were proud to have set a new standard for realistic facial animation

2058656 the joy and danger inherent in spinning out of control on a merry go round
2058657 each time a person stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring these ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance

2058663 we are right now testing that by overproducing micrornas in the daughter cells that have begun to differentiate
2058664 maybe this would also help aging stem cells maybe you can keep them dividing by using more micrornas

2058674 es necesario construir escuelas brindar educaci n pero tambi n es necesario que los padres de los ni os tengan trabajo bueno y vivienda porque con la panza vac a nadie estudia ni aprende
2058675 con la familia destruida por la falta de trabajo los chicos terminan no viniendo a la escuela a aprender sino a que le den lo que no le pueden dar en sus casas que es lo que nos pas tantas veces en los ltimos tiempos a los argentinos
2058676 por eso recuperar la escuela dijo no es s lo recuperar un edificio es recuperar adem s una forma de vivir los argentinos venir a la escuela a estudiar a aprender a crecer luego ir a la casa donde est n los padres que tienen trabajo y nos est n esperando para seguir dando la otra educaci n la que no se puede dar ac la que se da en la familia en la casa formando buenos ciudadanos y seres humanos

2058705 this decision will mean that the uk will have the poorest survival figures for metastatic renal cell cancer in europe
2058706 the decisions nice has to make are some of the hardest in public life
2058707 nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs
2058708 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
2058709 the possibility that we clinicians may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage and a devastating blow to the kidney cancer community
2058710 if this draft guidance is not overturned there will be no point in me accepting referrals of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer as three quarters of patients do not gain any real benefit from interferon leaving only the option of palliative care
2058711 this decision will mean that the uk will have the poorest survival figures for metastatic renal cell cancer in europe
2058712 sutent produces a remarkable effect on survival for patients it is now no longer ethical or reasonable for patients to have access to treatment with only interferon

2058714 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out

2058720 an original contribution to historical scholarship in the form of significant published work
2058721 ought to be answered before this country heads any further down that path
2058722 the goal was to make it more understandable easier to read and reduce the number of printed copies of school profiles
2058723 while meeting these requirements we decided to take a look at other states profiles and try to exceed what was being published elsewhere
2058724 school profiles are a snapshot of information within our school system
2058725 as more information becomes available additional links will be added to the school profile pages making it easier for one to find information on the doe website the profiles will continue to become more dynamic and will allow doe to provide quality information to all of our citizens
2058726 the new school profiles system is a stepping stone to other reports and information about education in delaware
2058727 its been a love hate relationship between our giants and the dodgers for 50 years ever since both teams came west

2058730 when my granddaughter cut her hair she sent it to locks of love in florida im going to suggest manny do the same
2058731 when mike played for me we were concerned about his weight
2058732 so when we went to the dominican republic i told an assistant to get mike a bike and a pedometer and check on his exercising
2058733 one of my guys would walk by mikes room and listen for spinning bike wheels
2058734 eventually my guy opened the door and found mike lying on a sofa with a pizza on his chest and his dominican trainer pedaling the bike
2058735 i had saved up 10 cents for a phillies scorecard in 1937 and waited outside the clubhouse to get an autograph
2058736 finally buster came out and when i asked for his signature he pushed me and said to get out of his way
2058737 well six years later when i was playing with greenville and went to augusta maynard was batting and i was pitching
2058738 when he asked if i had a problem i told him about the incident six years earlier and told him it broke my heart

2058742 after graduating from college on a navy rotc scholarship i received a commission as a united states marine officer
2058743 i was an active duty marine officer from 1969 to 1973 and served in vietnam in 1971 where i was awarded a cross of gallantry in combat by the republic of vietnam among other decorations i served as a reserve duty marine officer from 1973 1979
2058744 i am the former chairman of the tennessee democratic party having served from july 1 2005 through jan 13 2007 in addition i served as treasurer of the tennessee democratic party from january through june of 2005
2058745 i was the delegation whip of the tennessee delegation to the democratic national convention in 2004 most recently i have been the tennessee political director for obama for america
2058746 i have practiced law in nashville for 32 years and i am currently a partner in the law firm of trauger amp tuke in nashville
2058747 i represent meharry medical college among many other clients and i am an adjunct professor at vanderbilt university school of law where i teach professional and ethical considerations in corporate practice
2058748 i am running because i believe tennesseans deserve better from washington and i will take principled leadership to the senate to bring common sense solutions to create and maintain jobs in tennessee end high gas prices and our nations addiction to foreign oil by supporting new energy policies make quality health care coverage more affordable and accessible to individuals families and small businesses and bring a responsible end to the mismanaged war in iraq
2058749 i also will work to end bad trade deals that have cost tennessee over 43 000 manufacturing jobs since lamar alexander went to the senate
2058750 i first thought about running for the u s senate when i saw the direction our state and our nation were taking under the leadership of career politicians like lamar alexander politicians who are completely out of touch with working families back home washington has changed lamar alexander
2058751 he has voted for big oil against providing much needed tax relief for working families in tennessee against medicare against the g i bill and against ending corporate welfare to help pay for education funding lamar has let tennessee down in washington and its time for new leadership
2058752 i am a marine who fought in vietnam so i understand the challenges of fighting an insurgency and the sacrifices made by our fighting men and women and their families
2058753 i also understand the need to end the war in iraq with honor while protecting our troops and honoring our veterans
2058754 as an attorney i have practiced adoption law health care law finance law energy law and business law
2058755 i helped rewrite tennessees adoption code and helped found and was president of the american academy of adoption attorneys
2058756 the first thing i would do in the senate is work to end our addiction to foreign oil by redirecting more support to alternative energy production relieving our dependence on foreign oil while creating thousands of green collar jobs in strong manufacturing and agriculture states like tennessee
2058757 tennessee could become a leader in achieving energy security through wind power solar power and advanced biofuels made from non food crops
2058758 i have toured oak ridge national laboratory where this research is nearing fruition we soon will be producing clean renewable energy while allowing more of our nations farmers to continue doing the good work of feeding our nation and the rest of the world
2058759 i can summarize my solution for illegal immigration in one word enforcement enforce border security enforce the laws on the books and penalize businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers in order to protect american jobs
2058760 this can be accomplished with sophistication and effective electronic surveillance it must include all our borders including ports where cargo ships must be subject to routine as well as unannounced inspections and airports where more effective screening techniques must be employed
2058761 we also must recognize that america indeed is a nation of immigrants of course we cannot reward illegal behavior but we must find ways to bring the millions of undocumented workers and families here out of the shadows we must identify them and require their compliance with our laws

2058780 higher fuel prices interest rates and the wider economic uncertainty have resulted in a slowing of people heading to showrooms
2058781 the proposed tax hike has had a devastating impact on new car sales
2058782 it is clear that the downturn has been exacerbated by the impact of this unfair tax hike and the industry has significant concerns that orders will continue to be affected in coming months
2058783 if this situation continues the government will not receive the additional revenue it had projected and there is a real risk that it will cost jobs
2058784 in these circumstances one would have to question why the government would pursue this tax increase

2058786 in the age of the individual you have to be your own brand
2058787 its time for me and you to take a lesson from the big brands a lesson thats true for anyone whos interested in what it takes to stand out and prosper in the new world of work
2058788 no one wants to talk about it over here people are very quiet about it and dont want to admit that theyre working on themselves but in new york people will happily introduce you to their personal branding con sultant
2058789 anyone from plastic surgeons to bankers to someone who owns a series of private health clubs
2058790 if you are working in a bank that has 8 000 employees you cant exactly write the strapline
2058791 he has turned personality traits perfectionism elitism control freakishness into business processes
2058792 become known by establishing a blog and use it to network with others take risks reach out to new people and never quit there are far too many opportunities and people out there to let roadblocks get in your way remember that you are the ceo of you inc this is the mantra of tom peters the so called father of personal branding so you need to make things happen and not rely on others
2058793 get smart and get real you inc exists whether you want it to or not manage your personal brand so you can benefit from the new digital landscape instead of suffer from it
2058794 theres no question that a strong brand will generate sales and recognisability but it can be a double edged sword if you apply it to a person
2058795 once your brand is successful people will want you to carry on being the same thing and you might not want to you create the brand to serve you but then you become the servant of the brand
2058796 brands by their nature are simple its all about finding a single meaning and sticking to it there is no room for shades of grey that is ultimately stultifying because as human beings were so much more than that were full of nuances
2058797 the thing i find uncomfortable is that branding is a commercial step
2058798 it changes the way our relationships operate putting them on a commercial level it will pull away at our social fabric if our relationships always have a layer of commercialism and self interest to them
2058799 it is the most powerful tool i have ever come across
2058800 when i worked as a headhunter what always fascinated me was how some people were not as qualified as the next person but they just seemed to get all the luck all of the time when i stumbled on personal branding i realised how that had happened
2058801 if we move to a world where everybody is a noisy single message brand just imagine the grim cacophony
2058802 its like having everyone walking around wearing a neon sandwich board
2058803 if we dont decide what our image and personal brand should reflect about us others will

2058825 therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
2058826 now no but on july 1 2009 he will be at real madrid
2058827 ronaldo has accepted to stay on at united on condition they accept madrids offer in 2009
2058828 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying
2058829 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
2058830 i was responsible for all this controversy i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
2058831 we knew this was the case that ronaldo would be staying i flew to portugal some weeks ago and we cleared the air and he spoke to some of the players
2058832 the boy has been through a troubled time in terms of the approaches from spain but once he knew my stance he then settled down

2058836 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
2058837 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2058838 because hes a high profile inmate he will not be in the general population
2058839 i think its the most extreme measure he can take
2058840 i think it was most appropriate for judge giles to take action regarding defendant kilpatricks bond considering his most recent behavior

2058890 we have loved some parts of florida and the competition with the herald and palm beach post has been great we will miss the beach but getting home to the west is very exciting
2058891 jack is a seasoned visual journalist who possesses an abundance of technical and editing knowledge that has only enhanced his great photojournalism skills
2058892 a longtime anchor of the photo staff jacks commitment to excellence and accountability makes him an ideal choice to lead the operations and logistical side of the department
2058893 this is a new position at the paper so it is a great opportunity to build out the job have some fun and hopefully make some great things happen
2058894 the prospect of going back to my childhood home to help guide a staff of eager television photojournalists in a place as varied and visual as alaska and with the wholehearted support of station ownership and management makes this perhaps the most exciting time of my career
2058895 but i will remember the st petersburg times as a unique place to commit journalism its leaders truly value distinctive journalism above the pressure for profit which is hard to beat in these days in newspapers returning to the west coast feels like going home again im looking forward to being hands on with content again and to work with another bunch of extremely talented journalists of which ive been blessed to experience for many years in this business
2058896 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
2058897 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer but there were certain things we were not willing to do because they were not in the best interest of the team
2058898 we like them always will see brett favre as a green bay packer and our respect for him never will change
2058899 many californians are taking a responsible approach to energy conservation and environmental protection the state has instituted programs to assist consumers with these often expensive projects
2058900 this bill would ensure that these residents are not excluded from these programs because their association will not decide in a timelier manner
2058901 every california homeowner should have the opportunity to reduce their energy bills and contribute to solving our states environmental challenges
2058902 this bill will help many of the people who contact us about problems with obtaining permission from their hoa

2058912 a speech is like a dress on a beautiful woman it has to be long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep you interested my colleague juju chang has achieved this on both points
2058913 ive never been around so many asian babes in my life
2058914 create a harder problem for us we are seeing that more and more
2058915 to have a device that can look into the ground and detect at a very low false positive rate a pressure plate thats under there
2058916 it seems to be a deliberate improper use of the emblem
2058917 we should be able to upgrade stuff weve had for 20 years
2058918 this is one of those go wild years its make it or break it
2058919 the industry is more optimistic about the opportunities youre seeing that with the record acres in new york for soybeans and added acres for corn
2058920 its certainly a different picture today than it was five years ago with 2 a bushel corn that certainly is good for farmers
2058921 theres a good opportunity to make a profit but its not a cakewalk
2058922 if the prices drop we could have real problems because the farmers costs have just skyrocketed
2058923 synthetic biology is an incredibly exciting field with more possibilities than many of us can imagine
2058924 while this proof of concept experiment is simply one step forward weve established a foundational technology that just might set the standard of what we should expect in subsequent work
2058925 namely building a biological device that does precisely what you predicted it would do
2058926 essentially what happened is that the cell remembered that it had been exposed to galactose and continued to pass this memory on to its descendents
2058927 so after many cell divisions the feedback loop remained intact without galactose or any other sort of molecular trigger
2058928 they design quantitative models to help them understand what sorts of pressure and weight the bridge can withstand and then use these equations to improve the actual physical model we really did the same thing in fact our mathematical model not only predicted exactly how our memory loop would work but it informed how we synthesized the genes
2058929 if we ever want to create biological black boxes that is gene based circuits like this one that you can plug into a cell and have it perform a specified task we need levels of mathematical precision as exact as the kind that go into creating computer chips
2058930 one day wed like to have a comprehensive library of these so called black boxes
2058931 in the same way you take a component off the shelf and plug it into a circuit and get a predicted reaction thats what wed one day like to do in cells
2058932 i appreciate your site and the materials that you have available for individuals like me who are completely naive to how things work in the mortgage industry next time i will be in control of the outcome for a win win situation

2058937 most office projects in orange county have at least one executive suite
2058938 in the united states we called them executive suites but when we went international the europeans didnt know what that term meant so we changed the organization name to office business centers explained fabish who with his parents owns three centers in ohio
2058939 theres also something called touchdown space which is an open air cubicle that an individual can lease if he cant afford a full office
2058940 in the 80s executive suites were going crazy and landlords thought they could do it themselves but clients are very demanding
2058941 since january the virtual office part of our business has grown 20 percent because of the economic downturn
2058942 working from home was the rage a few years ago but many people who did it found they dont like being in their house 24 hours a day people miss socialization
2058943 plus they find theyre not as productive as they thought they would be because of all the distractions at home
2058944 people come to us because they cant work from home its a personal preference how do you work
2058945 this complacency cuts across all the main sectors of society and will be one of the main challenges we will have moving forward

2058961 wearing this red jersey for the first time sent shivers right down my spine
2058962 i had offers from others but money cant buy this feeling theres no way id go waste someones time on a full ride when its not where i want to play
2058963 ive wanted to do this for so long you get goose bumps when you put on this jersey and im sure i will every time i put it on from now until i graduate
2058964 my parents have always taught me to give back to the community sometimes the community helps make you who you are right now lincoln is my new community and its always nice to give as soon as you can and whenever you can
2058965 he wanted to know what i did when i wasnt playing football and i told him about some of my hobbies like going scuba diving or just hanging out with my friends
2058966 is just amazing i really didnt even know what to say when they told me i was invited it was just so exciting i was pretty much speechless
2058967 its a given that these scholarship players have to be here
2058968 but its an even better feeling for a walk on i cant tell you how much i enjoy being here and how much i appreciate reaching out to the community like that as part of a program that means so much to so many people
2058969 its good to go out and visit places like this
2058970 i mean these people dont have the chance to come and watch us play so its the least we can do im from a small town and i knew everybody there its just how i was raised when you go out and talk to people be polite and show them respect it makes you feel good inside
2058971 a lot of them talked about their kids and where they used to work were here to talk about what they want to talk about not just football
2058972 if you drive through it and blink your eye youll miss it
2058973 life skills are a great thing theyre trying to teach us
2058974 todays experience will go a long way to helping us embrace the program we have here
2058975 i dont have a question but i have a little advice it doesnt matter whether you win or lose its how you play the game youve all got spirit and thats what counts
2058976 to move it all was a fantastic feeling because i was beginning to think we were going to have to bring in extra pullers which would have taken another week
2058977 all of a sudden you see where there is not much growth were its been sitting in the sand all these years half of the propeller is out of water which no one has seen its mangled broken off blades

2058981 the ioc sets great store by the quality of the the football tournament
2058982 you understand mr blatter that i cannot comment on the ruling as we the ioc created cas
2058983 of course i can say i am concerned this situation will have to end
2058984 i have agreed with mr blatter we review it after the games i appeal to the clubs concerned werder bremen schalke 04 and barcelona to leave the players in china
2058985 let them live their dream like ronaldinho who is not one of the players involved in the controversy said it is his dream to play in the games
2058986 we have to let the players realise their dream just like the basketball players and the tennis players
2058987 i appeal to the clubs to observe the olympic truce till after the games
2058988 i am sure we can reach an agreement and that fifa will absorb it into their international calendar we will fight with mr blatter
2058989 we will then simply not have an olympic tournament we could of course revert to a beach football or five a side competition
2058990 they could say let them play but we want compensation is that the olympic spirit
2058991 we cannot have players withdrawn from the tournament and see them return home putting in danger the competition before it starts
2058992 as the most heavily forested state in the nation we know that maine people are turning to firewood this season to fight record high energy prices
2058993 for those who are new or returning to burning wood we want you to be safe and know how to burn wood properly
2058994 taking the step of burning firewood to offset some of the cost of oil is a smart one as long as you do it with safety as your first priority
2058995 together we can work to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and move toward a more secure energy future

2059003 during welcome week we try to give freshmen and transfer students a taste of what life is like here on campus as a way to get them acclimated to acu
2059004 the service project is a way to get them accustomed to doing service work for our community which is something we want them to do for the years they are here and beyond we as older students understand that there is nothing more powerful than a group of 900 to 1 000 students all working together to benefit the community where we live work and go to school
2059005 this type of project has resulted in collecting as much as 20 000 pounds of food in past years
2059006 as we seek to draw our students into real world issues and experiences collecting donations for the food bank is a natural connection
2059007 what better way for the freshman to tell the city of abilene we are here and intend to do great things

2059013 the desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive these are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
2059014 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
2059015 differ from the paradigm of a married heterosexual couple raising their biological children
2059016 thirty seven percent of parent households with children in the home are not headed by married heterosexual couples
2059017 since 1940 grandparents have been the primary caregivers without biological parents in the home for approximately 2 percent of all children in this country some 1 6 million children today
2059018 forty percent of all children will likely be raised by unmarried partners living together for a portion of their lives
2059019 lesbian and gay parents are raising four percent of all adopted children in the united states as well as three percent of all children in foster care
2059020 until grandmothers and grandfathers can easily access the government benefits intended to keep their grandchildren healthy and safe until lesbian gay bisexual and transgender parents can have their relationships universally and unquestionably recognised until unmarried parents can access benefits without penalty or derision we will not be doing justice by the millions of american families that do not fit a small minoritys notion of what a

2059023 forecasts of strong global demand for oil in the long run coupled with diminishing supplies has prompted the emirate to allocate investments of up to 20 billion to raise its oil production capacity to 3 5 million barrels a day by 2010 up from 2 7 million barrels a day at present
2059024 i dont think it is possible a good few oil projects would have to contribute to such a target and with the shortage of materials and labor the whole industry is suffering from delays
2059025 we predict a slight increase of maybe 100 000 barrels a day by 2010

2059030 has been one of the most fascinating experiences of my life
2059031 youve got to just take care of yourself and have some foresight just understand that its 88 humidity and its 96 degrees and thats certainly going to take effect on you even if you feel like youre okay so were very aware of that
2059032 we had two tournaments on the east coast and they were like the driest weekends the least amount of humidity theyd had in 10 years we were like whats going on we wanted to prepare for beijing so no we havent got a lot of training in
2059033 it makes my joints feel better im 30 almost now every little edge helps
2059034 in regards to the heat and humidity we knew that was going to be elements that our athletes needed to be prepared for in beijing
2059035 there are other remedies that were using such as cooling vests that will allow them not to overheat on the day of their competition
2059036 i know that the ioc medical commission is monitoring that as well and will not put athletes in harms way in these games so we will take their lead but do everything we can within our control to assist our athletes in not having that hamper their ability
2059037 athens was hot on par with the air temperatures in beijing and sometimes greater but beijing is much more humid and the humidity is what makes it feel much hotter
2059038 atlanta on the other hand had conditions in 1996 more similar to beijing
2059039 the cooling effect of evaporation of sweat from the skin is not as efficient when the weather is humid so you feel it a lot more

2059081 i have had 46 students over the last five years a dozen of them are making theatre their lives all the rest will keep musical theatre in their lives they will be the audiences of the future
2059082 theyve been in some halls but nothing like roy thomson but we have done 50 fundraisers over the last five years they need to see what it is like to perform for nothing even after youve gained some success you owe it to the community to give back we do 10 or 12 a year without a penny but we are giving something back to the community the best we can
2059083 we opened the concert series at credit valley hospital when you see people in such pain and children with no hair and bandanas on their heads when you see the tears in their eyes even over a happy song it makes it worth your time
2059084 i tell the kids how do you perform in front of people like that i show them how to avoid eye contact while appearing to be looking straight at them you cant look at them really or you would be a basket case anyone with the artists sensitivities cant handle the pain
2059085 i have admired mark for many years and it was only recently that i saw that side of him when i saw him with his students that i realised what a great thing hes doing he could have done a lot of other things but he chose to go this route and he is giving his kids a unique opportunity they may not even know how unique it is to be with mark who is a man of such tremendous talent doing these venues he has performed at roy thomson hall more than any other artist and this is the special 20th anniversary of the seniors jubilee which showcases the talent of senior performers we wanted to honour mark we thought it would be fitting to do so this year
2059086 it is very seldom that people like me get recognition for giving back to the culture instead of always taking from it this is not an arts award with a lot of money attached to it it is an appreciation award
2059087 i dont know if were in a bull market but i just know the game has changed and my indicators say were going higher over the next three to four months

2059094 i havent heard anything about an upcoming wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i dont think shed ask me to walk her down the aisle

2059101 we had been monitoring that area in the past few months and we were aware that nesting was going on and thought the nesting had concluded

2059103 investigating to see if this is a concern we need to pursue further
2059104 the new guide lists the types of fish and small marine life such as mussels oysters and barnacles that inhabit each reef site
2059105 delawares sites are some of the best locations for fishing and diving because they provide the necessary habitat for small marine life and the reef fish that feed on them the guide includes detailed information on our reef sites and helps make them more accessible to anglers and divers
2059106 creating a successful reef requires more than just placing miscellaneous materials at the bottom of the ocean or bay
2059107 we select and develop reef sites by targeting the marine life we hope to enhance or establish and constructing a habitat that will benefit them
2059108 i just figured that was how they weeded out the good ones
2059109 we are open 52 weeks a year five to six days a week that is how we survived
2059110 my father couldnt understand why i would leave one school and go to another
2059111 i may very well have painted a portrait from every state of the union
2059112 the brothers have been regarded with much admiration in town for their place as the old time trade of professional barbers during their many years in the business
2059113 i knew one day they would ask and that one day came when they decided to have a portrait painted
2059114 the brothers who are the best of friends have much knowledge from a rich life getting to know the many personalities not only from camden but throughout maine and from all other states
2059115 the problems identified were over 90 were problems we identified ourselves and that we had self reported to the authorities above us and were working to correct even before the fda and inspector general were involved

2059123 coming over here and getting to play against international competition is a great experience for me to raise my game to another level because we are going to play in front of different fans different people watching it is just going to be a totally different venue
2059124 i think the game of baseball and softball will be reinstated in the olympic format
2059125 baseball has been really put out around the world and we have raised the bar for baseball by making it a global sport a world sport we had the world baseball classic a few years back and we didnt win who won japan won and korea showed well cuba fared well that shows you how the game has grown around the world
2059126 it is something we are all going to have to deal with
2059127 its a format to try to shorten the games and i understand that as far as how we are going to play that we havent had any simulation of that yet we still are going to play three or four exhibition games before we open up on the 13th and well probably try different scenarios with our players are we going to play for one run or are we going to play for a bunch of runs a lot of that will depend on what we hear from the scouts on run producing abilities of the other clubs
2059128 we had some extensive discussions and believe our rules are in very good shape
2059129 adjustments made in recent years have achieved our intended goals
2059130 this is a change in the way we do business but we believe it is a positive change
2059131 we hope to use the time to fully investigate some different ways to play the game and continue to monitor how it is played at the college level
2059132 ive only ever caught the worst things written about me ive never seen anything good
2059133 there are countries that have cyber capabilities equivalent to ours and in some cases that exceed ours
2059134 there are countries that are knocking on our door every day and they are a threat to our national security
2059135 were not worried so much about the noisy attacks as we are about the quiet ones
2059136 we have to be careful about assuming the technological superiority of the united states
2059137 thats the height of arrogance these attacks dont necessarily require a lot of skill or technology all they need is access to the internet
2059138 we work with the power companies to come up with sound backup plans and we work with the other entities that operate our critical infrastructure but if youre operating systems for a profit and making money from them then its not governments responsibility alone to protect them
2059139 were delivering services to the public using the same infrastructure they are
2059140 the last thing i would do is apologize for protecting our national security through the use of court authorized wiretaps
2059141 i would prefer a lot more privacy in the united states and there will always be instances of abuse of wiretap privileges but i cant apologize for surveillance thats done in the interest of national security

2059155 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2059156 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2059157 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2059158 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the phoenix public library catalogue download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
2059159 yeah guys just be calm 2 secs im a bloody human being too and i dont think the game deserved something that low that is why im going to put up a demo ok so you can judge for yourself
2059160 just lets put it this way its easy to follow the crowd but i put all my heart into this this is like my baby and well its then destroyed alot of people have enjoyed the game and of course it makes you guys feel better behind your pc to insult someone but wait until you try a demo and it will be different

2059173 unless you stabilize that border with pakistan and uproot the terrorist safe haven that has developed in the pakistan tribal areas youre not going to be able to stabilize afghanistan

2059181 whether a complaint for breach of fiduciary duty regarding the diminution of value of a defined contribution retirement plan states a claim for benefits under erisa
2059182 t he participant is entitled to the value of the assets in his account whatever that value may be

2059184 did not seek a readily ascertainable amount that would directly effect a payment to the plaintiffs
2059185 t he third sixth and seventh circuits have rejected the reasoning of the fifth circuit
2059186 a complaint for the decrease in value of a defined contribution account due to a breach of fiduciary duty is not for damages because it is limited to the difference between the benefits actually received and the benefits that would have been received if the plan management had fulfilled its statutory obligations

2059215 while this is the progression of the modern economy we need fair trade agreements that increase our economic prosperity while protecting maine jobs
2059216 congress must have a say in how new trade agreements between the u s and emerging economic powers are structured as well as regulation and evaluation of previous trade agreements

2059233 ive always loved the mental challenge of making a spreadsheet and moving things around and seeing how it all works
2059234 the biggest change i saw here at the college was going to the state system in 1997
2059235 when we were a district college we did things the way they worked the best for us and then when we went to the state system we had to follow its guidelines we had just changed computer systems and of course the state had a different computer system and its changing it again right now im too old to want to keep up with all of that any more

2059489 when it comes to abortion are there are many issues to consider when making a decision
2059490 the only way to know for sure if you are pregnant is to take a pregnancy test call the helpline at 1 800 672 2296 or email a pregnancy counselor for a place near you where you can take a free and confidential pregnancy test
2059491 americas crisis pregnancy helpline was established january 1 1995 when mike and anne sheaffer rented two billboards in dallas texas to broadcast their dream of adopting a child in the 1 100 calls the sheaffers subsequently received many were from women facing unplanned pregnancies who did not know where else to turn recognizing this unfulfilled need in society the sheaffers envisioned a confidential crisis line where women could receive the help they desperately needed acph functions in this capacity today as its trained staff provides counseling pregnancy related information and referrals for community resources acph is an independent non profit entity and is funded primarily by corporate and private donations
2059492 the american pregnancy helpline is a national free service that helps meet the needs of young women who are pregnant the website provides access to information and answer to questions and provides access to a toll free helpline to meet the needs of those with unexpected pregnancies
2059493 in 2003 the helpline became the american pregnancy association a foundation of health services for the public including education research advocacy public policy and community awareness utilizing a medical advisory committee and collaborating with other reproductive and pregnancy health organizations apa is a recognized leader of reproductive and pregnancy health information

2059497 abortion is just one hot topic we deal with contraception breast feeding infertility there are passionate views from different perspectives on all of these topics the way we work has proven to be successful for us and thats to provide education
2059498 what we find is that most women when they receive information desire to carry a child to term

2059513 the chinese government has ruthlessly suppressed even the mildest form of peaceful dissent by tibetans in tibet and china in the run up to the games and has barred tibetan exiles like chime dolkar from speaking up in china for freedom and human rights in tibet

2059540 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2059541 i think what theyre doing is theyre trying to capitalize on the buildup to the games
2059542 and the apparent opportunity tip believes the olympic games presents in terms of targeting and striking a blow to china that the threat is credible and should be taken seriously
2059543 is indicative of an orchestrated campaign designed to fulfill jihadists belief that they should provide warning before launching a significant attack
2059544 i think the actual olympics themselves the venues the guests the athletes are going to be safe
2059545 theres obviously significant numbers of uighurs with some sort of cause who have a grudge against chinese authority and are prepared to use violence to seek whatever objectives theyre seeking

2059547 we need someone with good language skills and most uighurs cant speak chinese well we also have high standards for cleaning the rooms and uighurs just cant meet those standards
2059548 i dont like the chinese because they dont like uighurs we are muslims and they dislike islam we have different values were two different people

2059551 this is a great opportunity for the city to support our plan to help significantly reduce the citys greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time promoting the re use of energy that would otherwise be wasted

2059553 i dont think thats an issue and it certainly shouldnt affect any child
2059554 every child born has the right to a decent existence whether they are beneficiaries or not it should not impact on the childs potential
2059555 its in the states interest to look after their potential citizens otherwise theyre looking after them at the end of the system
2059556 because poverty as we know is incredibly damaging for children in terms of what the state is then going to have to look at in healthcare loss of potential lower learning outcomes
2059557 during that time child poverty and economic inequality rose in new zealand more than in any other oecd country

2059566 cobos sostuvo una posici n diferente en el senado que respetamos pero que no compartimos
2059567 no hay que hacer un drama con el tema del vicepresidente
2059568 independientemente de la sensaci n que se gener de alivio en la poblaci n frente a una puja sectorial contra el gobierno lo que produjo la decisi n de cobos fue que los peque os productores del pa s paguen mas de retenciones que lo que el gobierno pensaba y que unos 2 000 grandes productores paguen el 35 por ciento de retenciones en vez del 45 por ciento
2059569 4 000 millones de pesos que iba a tener el estado para aplicar en pol ticas de redistribuci n social en caminos rurales hospitales y viviendas se lo terminaron apropiando 2 000 grandes productores

2059576 its summer fun and sun and yet theres this academic piece
2059577 you work hard during the school year and have this time where you can run around and have some fun but this will allow them to not come back with the same amount of cobwebs in the fall

2059579 we need to calm them down a little bit to start it off read the directions and stuff and at first theyre kind of like eh and then they get really into it and volunteer to do stuff
2059580 we get to experiment with stuff and we get to learn and we get to write stuff

2059614 the high speed rail bond is better as a result of senator yees efforts and his amendment to ab 3034
2059615 senator yee has rightfully fought to ensure that priority is given to the main line from san francisco to anaheim protecting the future of californias transportation network
2059616 the high speed rail bond has always been about finding ways to get millions of people out of cars and airplanes and into a cost saving and environmentally sound transportation portal
2059617 a piecemeal approach is not what is best for commuters visitors or the economy and is certainly not what is best for our environment as an advocate for high speed rail i will continue to be steadfast in securing the san francisco to los angeles corridor of the bullet train and then branching out to other cities
2059618 this bill will ensure that the high speed rail bond on this novembers ballot contains important environmental and fiscal safeguards and accordingly will help assure voters that their money will be wisely invested in a system that can dramatically improve californias environment while providing mobility options that improve our competitiveness and quality of life
2059619 ab 3034 now has some great amendments including senator yees plan to restore the primacy of los angeles to san francisco

2059628 the governments actions are completely unacceptable and we call on president lee to release jin young ok immediately to withdraw all the arrest warrants and to cease the harassment and surveillance of the trade union leaders and their families the government should be engaging in dialogue on these issues of huge importance to korean workers instead of once again resorting to anti union repression

2059642 small business budgets are like those of a family when their costs increase in one area theyre forced to make cuts in other areas cutting other benefits foregoing pay raises reducing hours or letting employees go are some of the difficult choices small business owners would have been forced to make none of these choices is easy and none is good for working californians
2059643 public health officials say paid sick day laws are a good idea because when sick people go to work their co workers and customers can also get sick
2059644 do you favor mandatory paid sick leave if other benefits pay or jobs would be cut to pay for the leave
2059645 we would all like to have all benefits that can be given
2059646 benefits are good things if companies are able to afford them

2059649 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2059650 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2059651 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2059652 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs

2059665 the police said we will first inquire whether adeel has committed suicide because the culprits told the police about the fact that their daughter wanted to embrace christianity because of adeel

2059672 the reality is that milwaukee has become very dependent on this population
2059673 and in fact milwaukee is milwaukee increasingly because of this population i think some people dont like it that way while it used to be an interesting anomaly its now who we are in this city if you do fix immigration and some of the issues around immigrants youre really just fixing milwaukee
2059674 its important that people understand that the latino population in this city and state is on the rise and more likely theyre going to see more people of hispanic descent around
2059675 its really refreshing when you go to a pick n save and hear so many people speaking spanish

2059680 we have identified a new molecular player t bet and when its missing there is spontaneous onset of the disease in the mice

2059682 deficiency of immune system peacekeeper pinpointed in mice as cause of ulcerative colitis
2059683 the emotion of embarrassment is only felt in the presence of and because of an audience even if that audience is imagined the nature of the audience has only scarcely been investigated so far but it is clearly vital social identity theory holds that when people act as group members their world view changes
2059684 we will investigate what happens when the embarrassed person is not a member of the group particularly if they have a high status
2059685 in this case people might actually show joy at anothers misfortune rather than empathy
2059686 if you trip over in the street you feel very embarrassed of course people in your own group who witness this your friends or those close to you feel empathic embarrassment and try to alleviate the situation and make you feel better
2059687 bienvenidos los esfuerzos para reorganizar el mercado para tratar de ofrecer medicamentos adecuados a la mayor parte de la poblaci n una de estas medidas es aumentar la oferta o la disponibilidad con el objeto de bajar los precios porque este es un pa s con alta desigualdad entonces el acceso al medicamento es muy dif cil y limitada
2059688 estos medicamentos tiene el mismo f rmaco o sustancia activa la misma forma farmac utica la misma concentraci n la misma administraci n de lo que es el medicamento de referencia estos productos al hacerles pruebas de intercambiabilidad se demostr que son seguros y eficaces que tienen la misma calidad que el de referencia
2059689 el art culo 77 de la ley de la propiedad industrial prev que por causas de emergencia o seguridad o de enfermedades graves se puede declarar como atenci n prioritaria la declaraci n la tiene que hacer el consejo de salubridad general cuando este consejo declara que se le d atenci n por el tipo de emergencia o por el tipo de gravedad entonces los laboratorios farmac uticos que tengan las instalaciones adecuadas para producir los medicamentos que se necesiten en ese momento solicitan lo que llaman una licencia de utilidad p blica y entonces la secretar a de salud fija las condiciones en las que se puede explotar esa licencia s est previsto en la legislaci n el gen rico tiene que ser seguro eficaz y de calidad igual que el que est considerado que es la referencia
2059690 la solicitud de un registro la pueden hacer tres a os antes de que venza una patente pero no se va a otorgar hasta que venza la patente salvo los casos antes mencionados

2059692 hay una gran lucha para eliminar barreras una de las barreras es el nombre en el caso de muchos medicamentos yo me atrever a a decir que un 80 por ciento de los medicamentos mexicanos ya no tiene patente entonces quit ndose esas barreras legales que adem s ya no las tiene v a el poder que tienen sus marcas se siguen teniendo precios elevados

2059703 officials committed what a dispassionate jury would recognize as a series of serious crimes under american law in the years after 2001
2059704 the annual breakdown of the doha round of trade talks is becoming a summer ritual it is time to be brave swallow hard and accept that the doha round in its present form has failed
2059705 the greatest expansions of world trade have tended to come not from the bloodless t ntonnement of some fictional walrasian auctioneer but from the barrel of a maxim gun the edge of a scimitar or the ferocity of nomadic horsemen

2059798 more troubling than the denied access to me and other elected officials was the fact that the general public was also prohibited from entering the press conference

2059826 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
2059827 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk

2059868 it means family responsibility and greatness all around its about being around people that i care for and who care for me its about being on the field performing with them and knowing that were all trying to achieve one goal thats to be the best that we can be
2059869 every day it gets harder and harder and we have a lot of excellent people working with us we have kevin ford whos our drill writer and he came on tour and he expects nothing but excellence its kind of hard to slack off and not be at 100 percent when youre in the heat and everybody around you is giving more and more effort than you are you just have got to keep on building and we we feed off of each other getting better every day and thats not a lie
