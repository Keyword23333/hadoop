1790000 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1790001 thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists and its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists

1790008 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated

1790017 the prosecutor has more control over life liberty and reputation than any other person in america his discretion is tremendous he can have citizens investigated and if he is that kind of person he can have this done to the tune of public statements and veiled or unveiled intimations or the prosecutor may choose a more subtle course and simply have a citizens friends interviewed the prosecutor can order arrests present cases to the grand jury in secret session and on the basis of his one sided presentation of the facts can cause the citizen to be indicted and held for trial he may dismiss the case before trial in which case the defense never has a chance to be heard while the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society when he acts from malice or other base motives he is one of the worst
1790018 at the center of the storm my years at the cia
1790019 i have a few tips for future cia directors and for anyone who aspires to participate in government at a similar level first you are never offstage anything you say can be used against you down the road to make someone elses point thats the way washington has evolved there are no private conversations even in the oval office
1790020 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisers in this or in any other context that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
1790021 yes we could do that but it would be wrong
1790022 l iberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people who have a right to knowledge and a desire to know but besides this they have a right an indisputable unalienable indefeasible divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge i mean of the characters and conduct of their rulers

1790042 it really has been a singular honor to have been part of mozilla
1790043 and im hugely proud of what weve been able to accomplish together
1790044 weve shipped firefox 1 5 2 and the amazing firefox 3 together taken the active users from tens of millions to gt 185 million in almost 50 languages achieved 50 market share in some countries built a thriving add ons ecosystem moved into mobile scaled our operations across the globe and most importantly of all continued to build a thriving passionate talented community that is a blast to be part of i know that mozilla will continue to kick butt without me impossible to do otherwise with the strength talent and passion of the people here
1790045 theyre preparing for the day when people realize we dont need windows anymore
1790046 i would expect those in abundance with something of this scope and import
1790047 breaking with the legacy of a product that first shipped 23 years ago seems wholly necessary in terms of keeping the product manageable and in sync with computings state of the art
1790048 if midori isnt real then i imagine something of this nature still must be in the works its absolutely as necessary if not more so to microsofts survival as their initiatives around internet advertising search and cloud computing offerings
1790049 at the very first phase we had four people building the original prototype
1790050 there was no way we could do a gui if we didnt leverage a lot of existing software we essentially were building a hardware product for transcoding
1790051 we needed control software and business logic to control the platform we wanted to spend the majority of our time on the control effort using an os that is easily embedded so to get all that stuff running we considered vxworks we only considered linux one of our engineers had prior experience with montavista so that was the real reason we chose it we tried to build our own distribution and that meant we needed to get the driver for the board it just so happened that montavista already had that
1790052 w e chose a stable version of the solution but we chose it right at the cutoff version so we didnt have the advantage of some of the upgrades
1790053 there are releases constantly and if you want a stable product you cant chase upgrades
1790054 we actually discovered kernel bugs and overloading the system we had to rewrite some drivers when we did a kernel upgrade and now we have strategies to do it better in the future in some sense if we had chosen bsd which doesnt change often that could have been a possible choice even now we are still exposing some kernel bugs that are difficult a real time environment that stresses the system shows the bugs were stressing it more than typical
1790055 personally for me ive worked in linux my entire career and a lot of us are like that
1790056 so when we chose linux the comfort level was there we also know the packages we can use on the system so it allowed us to provide a base very quickly and then we could build business logic on top of that we didnt have anyone specialized we had everyone doing everything so we can have a small team and we could do a lot of work if we hadnt worked on the existing linux knowledge we couldnt have done that
1790057 all the drivers were there it was very easy to do quickly
1790058 the rumours of a stamp duty holiday have created a

1790063 after discussion we will decide i am very open to views
1790064 i have already decided i will tell you what to do
1790065 we are on the right track but there needs to be a slight extension of the deadline
1790066 the project is screwed up we cannot deliver on time
1790067 make a list of the work that you do and lets see how i can help you
1790068 anyway you have to find a way out no help from me
1790069 well even if you told me earlier that would have made hardly any difference

1790159 most people spend their whole lives trying to figure out who they are but for me its about keeping it a secret
1790160 so long as a spirit does not rise above tile body consciousness it remains a stranger to the spiritual realms beyond
1790161 in roman catholic theology the beatific vision is the eternal and direct perception of god enjoyed by those who are in heaven imparting supreme happiness or blessedness while humans understanding of god while alive is indirect mediated the beatific vision is direct immediate thomas aquinas defined the beatific vision as the ultimate end of human existence after physical death aquinass formulation of beholding god in heaven parallels platos description of one beholding the good in the world of knowledge
1790162 if your eye becomes single your whole body shall be full of light
1790163 we spend most of our time in admiring the outer surface of worldly things and care not to see the very soul of the matter that lies hidden underneath and bespeaks the great creator the creative life principle without which even the surface beauty cannot exist for a fraction of a second
1790164 once a spirit transcends the physical realm it inherits as its birthright the spiritual kingdom for the kingdom of god lies within
1790165 if you would not leave the caravanserai of the body how can you reach the true home of your beloved
1790166 this transcendence of the spirit from the senses is technically known in sant mat as death in life self annulling and in the vedantic terminology as self analysis
1790167 the physical eyes can see only physical things and both of these are subject to decay and death
1790168 an animal with his head downwards may well think of eating and drinking all the time but fie on man with his head erect if he were not to look upward
1790169 as the spirit transcends the physical plane it has to pass through various realms characterized by stars the sun and the moon there it is greeted by the luminous form of the master who takes charge of the spirit with whom he proceeds by the sound current to reach the true home of our father
1790170 the spirit as it withdraws from the body proceeds by degrees from one plane to another until it reaches sat naam or haq from what has been said it should be clear that so far the spirit is an entity quite apart from sat naam the over lord of all is called khasum lord of all swami hari raj maha dayal or nirala unique in himself and indescribable the spirit gets merged in him just as a drop of water loses itself in the ocean or a ray of light in the sun
1790171 as water mingles with the water so doth light merge in the light
1790172 as a ray of light gets absorbed in the sun and a drop in the ocean so doth the light of spirit in the great light

1790197 cirque du soleil marks istithmar worlds first foray into the live entertainment space which is a key to our media focus
1790198 besides being a global tourist hub dubai is home to one of the fastest growing entertainment and media markets in the world presenting a huge opportunity for such world class cultural and entertainment facilities to add to the emirates rich tourism and leisure offerings this partnership comes in line with istithmar worlds strategy of realising the true growth and expansion potential of portfolio companies as it continues to diversify and strengthen its private equity initiatives
1790199 this partnership is a unique opportunity that puts forward the dream i have forged for cirque du soleil to continue at another level
1790200 in the coming weeks we will implement a development structure that will allow us to become a major player in dubai in addition to establishing a permanent theatre in dubai we will open a show production office a ticketing company and a technical equipment and set design rental company
1790201 having istithmar and nakheel as strategic partners will enable us to be even more dynamic and effective in international development cirque du soleil will be in a position to concentrate on our two main priorities managing growth responsibly and meeting global creative challenges
1790202 this partnership is the best of both worlds for me and my management team we can keep control of our creative challenges and operations while accelerating our growth doing projects all over the world the opportunity to be involved in an entertainment project of this scale in conjunction with the resources of istithmar world and nakheel is extremely exciting for all of us at cirque du soleil
1790203 cirque du soleil shows have always been major draws in attracting tourists from all over the world to such global leisure destinations as las vegas and macau the companys touring show which was performed here in dubai last year was one of the most successful single entertainment projects ever to be staged in the region and we are excited about welcoming a new touring show alegria in spring next year we are also confident that an original show and a brand new purpose built venue on palm jumeirah will capture the imagination and provide a further draw for tourists around the world to visit dubai

1790344 recordar n como en vi a del mar los concejales que presentaron una denuncia contra la alcaldesa fueron agredidos en este caso francisca zald var fue quien hizo las denuncias contra el alcalde cornejo y fruto de ello est sufriendo una campa a de amedrentamiento
1790345 pedir a que una campa a que estamos a tres meses se gu e por las cosas razonables por las propuestas y no porque una candidata no pueda estar en el concejo municipal as que mas all de la protecci n policial escuche a una de las manifestantes decir que va a tener que andar con carabineros en la campa a bueno eso es una provocaci n absolutamente innecesaria y que demuestra la debilidad

1790379 the first goal was to determine whether the mountain lion also known as cougar or puma is of north or south american descent
1790380 its believed that most captive mountain lions are of south american descent and a south american lineage would indicate that the lion either had been a captive or was of captive descent
1790381 in this case the lab determined that the lions origin was north american indicating a potentially wild lion
1790382 while this test does not conclusively prove the lion was wild there was no outward indication it had been in captivity and kdwp officials believe it probably was wild
1790383 there are several possible explanations but the most likely scenario is that the lab does not have sufficient dna samples from the source population to positively link the barber county lion with a particular population consequently the lab has continued to add dna from additional lions from other states to its database in hopes of making a connection
1790384 there is no guarantee that conclusive results to this test will be obtained
1790385 while such tests could continue indefinitely as additional samples are obtained by the lab the likelihood of obtaining conclusive results will decline substantially as comparison with lions from nearby states is completed nearby states are where the barber county mountain lion most likely originated assuming it is in fact wild

1790649 if you ask in the right way your prayers will be answered
1790650 i dont come here just to pray for myself i also ask the mahdi to take care of my family and their needs
1790651 i was looking into the well with my flashlight hoping to see the mahdi but not to tonight
1790652 i have not had the privilege to see him yet but ive had many dreams about him in one of my dreams i saw a big bright light in the sky and this figure standing over me
1790653 and because we believe that he is going to come back soon we can believe in heaven and hell and we can believe in the life after death
1790654 that will actually serve as the red carpet rolled out in and if all this wasnt mystical enough theres also the belief that when the mahdi comes back he will be accompanied by jesus christ s nuclear program followers of the mahdi are getting ready for judgment day

1790700 richard nixon has never been one of my favorite people anyway for years ive regarded his existence as a monument to all the rancid genes and broken chromosones that corrupt the possibilities of the american dream he was a foul caricature of himself a man with no soul no inner convictions with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad the nixon i remembered was absolutely humorless i couldnt imagine him laughing at anything except maybe a paraplegic who wanted to vote democratic but couldnt quite reach the lever on the voting machine

1790709 the best advice i can give you is to search your heart for what truly makes it sing and then find a way to sing your song sing it for you your song is meant to bring you joy not to please the joys of others
1790710 there will be those who will tell you that you cant sing your song or may think your song is foolish and try to dissuade you from pursuing your song it is your choice whether to follow your heart you can believe those naysayers if you like you do have that choice but then you will always be searching without finding the joy of your true song deep within you already know what it is
1790711 past lives are of unimportance to me we have been together in other lifetimes in similar situations where you have been the caregiver and reversed as well which body suit we are wearing at the time is not the important thing what matters are our experiences together what we meant to each other and what we learned from each other dwelling in past places is not productive from my point of view being present and paying attention to where you are now is truly what matters it is the only way to get you where you are going the things that you have done in the past have helped to put you where you are now whether physically or spiritually

1790782 in questo modo possiamo valutare tutte le propriet energetiche di un campo sonoro come il tempo di riverberazione ossia quanti secondi lenergia sonora impiega a estinguersi in un dato punto dellambiente e altri parametri legati alla percezione del nostro sistema uditivo

1790797 a raw food diet has plenty of advocates but whether its the right choice for a cancer patient is open to question
1790798 there are only a couple dozen studies worldwide on relationships between raw foods diets and anything else
1790799 what you could say about a raw foods diet and cancer risk or cancer treatment could be something thats extrapolated and kind of surmised
1790800 based upon the body of evidence related to diet and cancer in general
1790801 i am fascinated by some of the claims made by raw foodists
1790802 but im cautious about them as well i am sympathetic and skeptical at the same time
1790803 i was experiencing a whole range of health problems at the time
1790804 all of those challenges have gone away i have way more energy than ive ever had and i havent been sick in many years i sleep a lot deeper and my brain works better
1790805 neither the american cancer society nor the national cancer institute goes so far as to recommend a raw food diet to reduce the risk of cancer from these chemicals
1790806 i think theres good evidence to say yes some raw foods like salads are a good thing
1790807 having a variety of preparations is the way to go
1790808 the second year i was stable by the third year my nails were brittle my hair thinned and i didnt have strength my feeling at the time was that i was not getting enough protein when i added fish my nails got better i got stronger and my hair got thicker
1790809 i basically eat a lot of the superfoods on our web site and a variety of fresh food
1790810 mostly blended foods that are high nutrient high mineral and low in sugar i eat a wide range of things and its very intuitive
1790811 the idea that everybody could increase the portion of raw foods and vegetables in their diets and benefit from it is probably an accurate statement

1790954 from afp a standard issue story in which government officials link video games to crime and then order a crackdown thai authorities banned the grand theft auto computer game on tuesday after a disturbed teenager allegedly killed a taxi driver in a copycat crime following news earlier tuesday that the games distributor would no longer stock the game thai police told afp they had officially banned it because of obscene content so far so good police will work with the culture ministry brrr to arrest vendors of the game who can be put in jail for three years and fined up to 180 dollars online vendors can get five years and a 3 000 fine because its really vastly more evil to sell things via the intertubes but heres the weird part of the story an 18 year old high school student has been charged with robbery and possession of a weapon and could face the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted police said the teenager had become incensed when he could not afford to play the game which encourages gamers to kill and steal cars in order to accrue points so he didnt get to play the game and he still pulled off a copycat crime thats some powerful video game

1791152 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1791153 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1791178 no 2nd arg for the default dir is given and the filename passed in is relative foo in the example i gave
1791179 i traced this to icicle file name input p which returns a null incorrectly i think
1791180 heres why it fails stringp minibuffer completion predicate returns nil minibuffer completion predicate is in fact nil and stays nil throughout a series of calls in the completion
1791181 in icicle file name input p if i replace the stringp with a null things work at least for case
1791182 it turns out the problem is in file name all completions for some reason it fails to add the expected trailing on directories

1791194 with habitats under increasing threat conservation seed banking is an important strategy for both storing and understanding genetically important wild seeds
1791195 this experiment could lead to some ground breaking research by providing a preliminary evaluation of space station seed banking a possible option for the future
1791196 an insurance policy for the world could be to have some seeds up in space as well
1791197 one of the things that has been reported from china is that the radiation has led to giant vegetables and changes in the genetic structure
1791198 our hypothesis is that the trip in space for six months wont have any major impact on these very tough resilient seeds
1791199 they might be the sort of things we would take up into space not only for food but also if were looking at producing oxygen in space or setting up micro climates
1791200 if the billing process takes nearly 50 of the billed revenue you cant offer 99 cent music and bill it to the mobile phone
1791201 with the royalties and other costs the math just doesnt work out compare the cost of billing purchases to a credit card and its easy to see why mobile payments arent taking off
1791202 bands and artists are increasingly using mobile to form direct relationships with their fans that are then monetized through other means such as tickets to live shows merchandise and fan clubs
1791203 in addition given consumers reluctance to pay for music on their phones marketers are finding new opportunities to partner directly with carriers labels and even music artists themselves
1791204 i think content in general is something the service providers have struggled with because its new to them
1791205 telecom companies used to not offer any content then there were ringtones and for a lot of them their eyes just glazed over they thought were going to make millions and i think they kind of learned the hard way that its more complicated than that
1791206 the music business has really been struggling with the internet
1791207 their model was to take that one hit track squeeze so much revenue out of it bundle it with other tracks and repurpose it on a greatest hits album or a soundtrack
1791208 appears to justify bigger aircraft with greater fuel offload capability
1791209 current real world scenarios demonstrate that typical sorties involve offloading 65 000 to 70 000 pounds of fuel
1791210 there is additional value to the government for the additional fuel offload amount above threshold

1791218 the crowd of 200 000 which turned out in berlin to hear a mere candidate for the us presidency confirms that obama is more a phenomenon than an ordinary candidate
1791219 and he is receiving twice as much coverage as mccain this is arguably the result of an uncritical gushy media but i cant see it changing
1791220 phil take your head out of your bong for a minute
1791221 his one remaining big media event is the convention and mccain will blunt that bounce with a vp announcement the day after obamas likely messianic like speech that he will give to cheering throngs that all the msm will have orgasms over
1791222 the media have plenty they could throw at either candidate and they will at the right moment
1791223 my assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now
1791224 people like obama should not be running the most powerful country in the world they are just too damned idealistic
1791225 and its been a long time since theres been a truly visionary politician on the world stage
1791226 when hes not anything like that there is no evidence hes intelligent and when he isnt speaking from prepared material he bumbles and stutters and fouls up far worse than george bush
1791227 verily who is this child that he opens our hearts and minds to the audacity of hope
1791228 i am prepared to be as vicious nasty and deceitful
1791229 if obama wins the excitement should come because it is a huge symbolic victory in a country where racism is rife
1791230 their journalists have donated a lot of money to obama and none to mccain
1791231 the impression i have been given on the rare occasions that i view fox news is a dislike of obama
1791232 racist attitudes or prejudice are still held by moderate portions of the u s population members of every american ethnic group have perceived racism in their dealings with other groups
1791233 given the sources i have viewed and my more regular viewing of fox news a few years ago it appears to me that fox news is biased
1791234 perhaps before you go round calling people you disagree with leftist bigots thats the only reason i can see that you would call me such names
1791235 there is a strong undercurrent of racism in the united states
1791236 but dont go back to my statement regarding racism being rife because i have admitted in this post and in my previous post that it was a poor choice of words
1791237 today blacks are again increasingly concentrated if not legally segregated into failing schools
1791238 lingering prejudice makes life harder for many black job applicants
1791239 a cumulative verdict of racial double standards lies beyond reasonable doubt

1791243 it was the start of a savage hourlong attack by medellin then 18 and five fellow gang members who raped the girls and forced them to perform sex acts before beating then strangling them with a belt and shoelaces it would be four days before their bodies decomposing in the houston heat were found by then medellin already had boasted to friends about having virgins blood on his underpants

1791249 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
1791250 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

1791262 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1791263 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions

1791265 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1791266 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1791267 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1791268 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1791269 we apologize for the confusion but in an abundance of caution we treated this unaccounted for laptop as a serious potential breach

1791273 there is absolutely no way these smaller rural towns can take this kind of hit and not increase property taxes
1791274 im trying to find a solution and this bill is a first step in that direction
1791275 from our residents perspective this legislation makes sense and is the fairest way to do it have the folks that are breaking the law pay for it
1791276 you have to realize its a numbers game and a lot of these larger towns arent affected
1791277 it doesnt work that way everybody gets a ticket for something along the line
1791278 its creating another opportunity for some towns to grab statewide money for their own problems instead of finding real solutions to their high property taxes
1791279 sometimes your it is organized around efficiency and your business is organized more around responsiveness
1791280 an us versus them culture where it hunkers down behind the technologies they manage problems they solve and metrics like help desk tickets served system capacity uptime and volumes
1791281 at a minimum the cultures shouldnt be in conflict with each other
1791282 its more than just communicate communicate communicate which you hear all the time its actually being very disciplined and very organized about it

1791298 its a scheme that ranged from street operatives to the ceo of a hospital
1791299 scheme to defraud the medi cal and medicare programs out of millions of dollars
1791300 within the past four years hundreds if not thousands of other homeless persons in skid row have been recruited hospitalized treated and discharged in a manner substantially similar as part of a long running scheme to bilk the medicare and medi cal programs out of millions of dollars by causing unnecessary hospitalization for paid recruits
1791301 today we are sending the message that those who would seek to defraud our healthcare system and those who would callously exploit mentally impaired and drug addicted homeless men and women to turn a profit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
1791302 these criminals thought they could get away with this scheme because they figured no one cares about the homeless on skid row they were dead wrong
1791303 at first when i saw all these agents in all their shirts i thought it must be a training exercise

1791311 its something im definitely looking forward to and something devin is looking forward to to get an opportunity to show what he can do not only as a basketball player but as a leader and of course we have eduardo who is the eldestatesman of our team at the tender age of 32
1791312 i never questioned what theyre doing and i definitely wanted to be here
1791313 its the way it goes its the business of basketball sometimes guys get moved who didnt want to and sometimes guys are thrown into a deal all those different types of things happen you have to accept it and im going to make the best of it this is my opportunity to step up and be a leader on and off the court
1791314 every year regardless of if its the same team or a new team theres always a new challenge its always something to really see how you handle a particular situation this is something new its a new team from what i understand theyre putting in a new offense were going to start fresh and hopefully good things will come out of it
1791315 if i need to put the ball in the basket more thats what im going to do i just want to find a way to help and get this team on the same page we have a lot of guys who can do a lot of things we just have to find a way to put it together and im going to do my part
1791316 were just going to do our best to bring the ability out of each player and get what we can i think were going to expect a lot more from devin and from our new guys
1791317 everybody whos here is going to have to do more its not like oh youre a rookie youre a second year guy you didnt play much last year no our focus now is to give us a little more find it from somewhere and hopefully that mentality will push us farther than everyone might expect us to go

1791339 sprint nextel currently expects to report higher post paid subscriber losses in the third quarter due to a seasonal uptick in churn when compared with second quarter 2008 results
1791340 we expect sequential declines in post paid gross adds to moderate and we expect modest pressure on post paid average revenue per user for the balance of 2008 this combination of factors is expected to result in a sequential reduction in adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization for the third quarter capital spending for the wireless and wireline segments is expected to be comparable to first half levels of 1 3 billion and 261 million respectively also expects free cash flow to improve substantially in the second half of 2008 furthermore the company expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants for the foreseeable future and expects to reduce gross debt by at least 1 billion by the end of the third quarter

1791461 ghanaians should be patient about mario he doesnt know anything yet about ghana so we the players at the top must show him how our country is
1791462 many people have spoken to him and that confuses him i am his senior brother and as a ghanaian i have the responsibility of painting the correct picture for him
1791463 he is a very nice guy talented and funny i am in constant touch with and cant say nothing more about his international future
1791464 i cant decide his future for him but i can advise him on what to do and that is clear
1791465 if he decides to play for ghana i will be over the moon because ghana is my heart
1791466 any good addition to the ghana squad is what we are looking for to continue to make our country the force in africa and across the globe
1791467 i am very happy because of all the options i had to leave levante betis was the most interesting one and i can only be happy with the efforts they made to sign me

1791472 example of the conflicts that frequently emerge between the law and quilombola traditions and between environmental protection and the right to use the land
1791473 it was one of the first things president lulas government did
1791474 durban told governments they needed to do more to promote racial equality that spurred the black movement and through their pressure they insisted on the need to create seppir
1791475 we were created as a special secretariat devised to advise the government about ways to improve things like healthcare and education
1791476 we are designed to make sure that the governments plans are cross cutting so that they provide services to everybody and so that there is racial equality throughout all sectors
1791477 access to land health education construction of housing electrification environmental rehabilitation social assistance and encouragement of local production
1791478 many people know they are black but too often blackness is still associated with negative things
1791479 so instead they use their individuality as a strategy to overcome racism
1791480 understand brazil or make brazil into something you can understand in our country blacks and whites live together we were taught that we have had legal equality since 1890 we didnt have jim crow or apartheid our restrictions have been economic and in terms of citizenship rights this is where our struggle is
1791481 initially the fight against racism was an afro descendant concern but now other groups the indigenous the lgbt palestinians immigrants the rom jewish communities religious groups and more have become part of the discussion groups that were somewhat dispersed have now coalesced to unite in the fight against discrimination
1791482 governments have gone from total denial of the problem stating that there was no racism to total commitment to attacking the problem many have supported agreements that in the past had been ignored many of our social leaders have been welcomed into government discourses since durban governments have made efforts but they have not advanced far enough they are not combating racism forcefully enough and theres no real social pressure for change

1791712 its so culturally diverse which is something i also love about atlanta but the whole world is here
1791713 feeling like i was limited in my career because i was in atlanta was a bummer although i guess i left at the wrong time because atlanta is blowing up right now
1791714 ive always liked that quote live in new york city once but leave before it makes you hard live in northern california once but leave before it makes you soft
1791715 you see stuff that you would never see anywhere else in a million years
1791716 i was on my way to coney island the other day and saw a man holding a parrot on the subway my boyfriend saw a girl walking a rabbit on a leash in the park yesterday like they say only in new york
1791717 i love the sense of freedom here that you can be or do whatever you want
1791718 i love the culture the citys history and the fact theres almost nonstop events exhibits and performances i love that people here accept one another regardless of external appearances
1791719 the city literally never sleeps and you could live here for a lifetime and it would still seem new
1791720 and i honestly believe that manhattanites are as friendly as atlantans
1791721 the people up here are a lot friendlier than i anticipated
1791722 im on a friendly basis with neighbors from all over the world from pakistan to greece to china to iran but new yorkers do cuss more the cussing on brooklyn streets is almost like music you hear the f word all day long from kids on skateboards to old folks on walkers
1791723 new york definitely tests your patience even if you are a generally patient person which i consider myself to be
1791724 dealing with mobs of people on the streets and in restaurants and bars is tiring especially on the weekends when visitors flood the city
1791725 when i come home i wont wear the clothes i wore to work
1791726 and i go barefoot because my shoes are so dirty thats my biggest complaint theres so much trash on the street
1791727 in atlanta you hear women complaining that theres no eligible black straight men
1791728 in new york its the same thing new york is a singles city and dating is great but if youre looking for a lifetime partner its not a place to be men have the pick of the litter here new york is not the place to come to find a husband
1791729 when its time to slow down and be grown up i will move back
1791730 in atlanta friends come over on a friday night and hang out that doesnt happen in new york
1791731 im very southern and love soul food i never found good soul food in new york
1791732 if were walking around virginia highland and somebody waves he says thats what i love about atlanta
1791733 i lived right by piedmont park and thought it was so great that i could live by the central park of atlanta and actually afford it
1791734 my studio apartment was the size of a one bedroom in new york and cost under 900 and i had a walk in closet central air and a dishwasher
1791735 and dating was so much easier in atlanta guys were actually gentlemen they would pick you up from your apartment for a date open doors for you and bring flowers thats just unheard of in new york city
1791736 i miss whole foods on ponce and the drive in movie theater i miss kevin rathbuns restaurants hes the mario batali of atlanta i miss the way people in atlanta are able to balance work with life
1791737 i came kicking and screaming because im a new york person
1791738 im a 12th generation new yorker on my dads side
1791739 i would not love to move back but my husband is a cable television executive and if we had to go back i would
1791740 now that im older it would drive me crazy to hear the rattling of subways buses people screaming horns jackhammers all the lovely sounds that you get i dont miss the noise at all
1791741 when i moved here some of my new york buddies in atlanta told me i was going to like it here when we had kids and i kept laughing
1791742 then we had kids and now its become oh i really dont want to leave
1791743 once we got here i seriously second guessed the decision
1791744 my theory is that because new york is such a unique place its difficult to move anywhere from there without an adjustment period theres something about that city love it or hate it that gets in your blood
1791745 it takes time to get to know and enjoy any city
1791746 there are a lot of wonderful unique things about new york but dont compare it to atlanta love atlanta for what it is dont hate it for what it isnt

1791777 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
1791778 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth
1791779 as a practicing periodontist i am constantly telling my patients to clean between their teeth more using dental floss or interdental cleaners

1791798 demand from the major customers in our aerostructures segment increased steadily as we progressed through the second quarter and our manufacturing centers responded with the focus and execution that they consistently deliver
1791799 our engineering services segment also continued to add employees and handle record demand from its key customers in an exemplary fashion the engineering services group has enhanced the product and service offerings of our aerostructures group and helped us manage large projects on newly developed aircraft we are pleased that the integration of d3 into lmi has progressed so well
1791800 as we look at the second half of 2008 and beyond the anticipated growth in revenues is expected to result in increased production rates and market share gains in the military segment higher tooling revenue from new projects on the gulfstream g650 the boeing 747 8 and other new programs customer offload programs on the boeing 747 8 and the start of production of the boeing 767 wing modification kit and winglet assemblies
1791801 these programs are expected to add to revenue in 2009 as well lmi continues to build a responsive project management organization in both segments in order to provide unique services to our customers as we continue along the path to producing design build products we are aggressively pursuing acquisitions and studying greenfield investments in composites and high speed machining in order to provide the products our customers require
1791802 we are pleased to have made substantial progress toward achieving our objective of initiating a phase ii clinical trial for athx 105 this year and we are confident that we are on track to meet this goal in addition with the phase i clinical trials now opened for our multistem program in ami and gvhd we look forward to accumulating the clinical data that will enable us to advance these programs through to the next phase of their development along with progress we expect to achieve in other areas our strong cash position will allow us to continue to move our programs forward in a timely manner
1791803 athersys placement in the russell microcap index along with research coverage by several industry brokerage firms gives us increased visibility and ongoing confidence that we are positioned to build shareholder value
1791804 the company continued to make progress across virtually every operational and financial metric in the second quarter
1791805 second quarter 2008 organic revenue growth over the first quarter was 7 8 percent in our federal government and dod business and 6 0 percent overall for kratos additionally and equally important is the quarter over quarter increase in the companys ebitda rate and we believe that we are on track to achieve our expected future profitability objectives and be in the range of our comparable peers for 2009 directly related to this objective in july immediately after the close of the sys merger we executed a significant integration related business realignment and cost reduction action which we believe will further increase kratos ebitda profitability in the future
1791806 the integration of sys is now underway including the areas of new business development and cost synergy realization which we began immediately upon transaction closing a critical element of our acquisition strategy is to gain access to new customers contract vehicles markets and opportunities and to position kratos for sustainable future organic growth this is a process not a single event and we hope to have the integration of both haverstick and sys substantially completed by the end of 2008 or the first quarter of 2009 with the companys financial performance continuing to improve as we move forward and complete the integration process
1791807 one has to wonder if bono is more invested in solving the problem the most effective way possible or doing it in a way that promotes his own image
1791808 we delivered 21 year over year revenue growth despite a challenging economic environment we continued to develop and expand first party client relationships through our consultative approach to understand and address their business goals
1791809 our third party clients however continued to feel the pressure of the weakened consumer climate and pricing pressure remained a constant in the second quarter
1791810 our strategic plan calls for growth in first party and the stabilization of third party we intend to accomplish this through the introduction of additional features that will further differentiate our offering and by the sales force re alignment already underway which will allow us to better service and grow our first party verticals by remaining highly focused on our strategic vision we believe we will be well positioned for growth in a large market opportunity
1791811 reconciliation of gaap net income and eps to non gaap net income and eps
1791812 throughout our restructuring process during the last 18 months our management team has worked aggressively to shape tecumseh into a global leader focused on our core compressor business after much hard work we are now beginning to see the results of our efforts
1791813 the major changes weve executed have left tecumseh well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities we have eliminated north american debt and increased cash creating a capital position that forms a platform for future growth
1791814 since the beginning of 2008 we have faced significant macroeconomic challenges to our business and the second quarter offered no respite with a significant slowdown in global economic activity adversely affecting our volumes and revenues we have also experienced rapidly rising commodity prices creating upward pressure on our cost of sales in addition the weakening of the u s dollar against the euro and the real has further negatively impacted our results despite the strides weve made in hedging currency and commodity exposure we anticipate these factors will continue to influence our results over the near term we are working diligently to address the softening sales environment by targeting new customers increasing volumes with existing customers and introducing new energy star products such as a refrigeration scroll compressor while also implementing price adjustments to cover the increasing costs of raw material inputs
1791815 with the restructuring of our balance sheet in 2007 the elimination of our heavy debt load and associated interest expense resulted in a positive impact on our financial results in the second quarter further we now have the resources necessary to improve our process engineering and focus on targeted market penetration within our core compressor business even in the face of challenging global macroeconomic conditions
1791816 with nearly 180 million in cash and equivalents and minimal debt were well positioned to support the continuing growth of our business even in the face of challenging external market conditions
1791817 we expect capital expenditures in 2008 and beyond to remain at much lower levels than historical averages especially with the elimination of capital intensive activities relating to businesses we have divested looking ahead we intend to remain disciplined with regard to capital investments resulting in a current forecast for capital expenditures of 20 to 25 million in 2008
1791818 with the continued unfavorable trends in foreign currencies and key commodities during the second quarter our efforts to effectively hedge this volatility will likely continue to be an essential component of our financial results for the remainder of the year
1791819 given the recent declines in oil prices we are hopeful that the ongoing surge in commodity price inflation may abate in the near term however the effective hedging methods weve pursued to mitigate this inflation will remain important tools to enable us to focus on managing our operations through the current period of regional economic softness

1791827 first quarter sales were generally soft in part due to the strong fiscal fourth quarter sales and in part due to the overall weak u s economy however based on seasonality as well as growth in new programs we are expecting a sharp increase in sales for the second quarter gross margin improved over our fourth quarter nearly 200 bps as a result of more favorable mix and improvements at intersema while we gave up a point with respect to sg amp a as a percent of sales we expect higher second quarter sales to move that ratio back down adjusted ebitda margin was consistent with last quarter which is actually quite positive given the lower sales for the quarter free cash flow of 6 million cash from operations less capital expenditures was strong and in line with our plan to exceed 20 million for the year
1791828 while the overall environment remains unpredictable we are expecting continued improvement in sales and operating statistics throughout the year and accordingly reiterate our 2009 guidance of 255 million in sales and 1 30 eps

1791843 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
1791844 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
1791845 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
1791846 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
1791847 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself
1791848 to get a kick out of smoking industrial hemp it would take a cigar the size of a telephone pole
1791849 i guess i would just make a plea saying we need the money you know we need the money on roads
1791850 i dont think we should let the threat of a lawsuit force us to implement something thats not well thought out
1791851 theres a lot of things that i pointed out in my state of the state address that havent passed unfortunately i cant think of one that has
1791852 we have a group of bank robbers out there and theyre shooting we have to get them off the street
1791853 its a sad day for all of us here and nobody likes to see this happen
1791854 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
1791855 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1791856 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
1791857 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
1791858 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
1791859 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
1791860 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
1791861 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
1791862 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
1791863 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
1791864 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the us and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition
1791865 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial

1792057 from our experience with previous versions of xdcam systems we were confident that the technology had the right combination of features quality and performance
1792058 these new models actually improve our picture quality and reduce our capture and storage cost over any previous hd format the xdcam camcorders will help to bring our production capabilities to a new level that will be a great asset to our olympics coverage
1792059 its rewarding to be an integral part of one of the major hd television sports events in the world
1792060 the broadcast requirements for the games continually increase in scope and complexity and are a perfect showcase for our hd production technology this year sonys new 2 3 inch xdcam hd system as well as all our proven hd equipment will play a major role in the coverage of the games bringing viewers at home an unforgettable experience
1792061 when you consider the age of our equipment prior to our upgrade this was a massive leap for us in terms of quality
1792062 our camera operators tell me one of their favorite features are the zoom and focus controls the servos allow you to pick a shot you like set it and as you are doing other shots you can go back to that same zoom point with just a push of a button were very pleased with the focus breathing compensation technology too which has greatly reduced the breathing issues we encounter when changing focus
1792063 we looked at every console on the market and concluded the c300 hd was the best choice the combination of versatility ergonomics and of course the incredible sonic quality was the deciding factor a typical day in studio a may involve work on a dozen or more wildly different projects so the c 300s instant reset capability is a necessity for us to help streamline our production throughput
1792064 technology however has allowed us to shift to a completely different mode of operation and the 300 hd integrates beautifully into our daw based methodology were excited to be part of the ssl family
1792065 with these new capabilities viz video hub is fully realized as a pivotal component anchoring the entire vizrt workflow spanning newsrooms editing stations channel branding control rooms and every production task from ingest to playout

1792067 the benefits of video hub 1 2 are operational simplicity reduced overhead and higher levels of creativity and productivity
1792068 our goal is to make early stage digital assets resemble their final on screen forms as closely as possible starting with accurate models makes the production process more efficient and provides a higher quality end result for example youd want to know early on whether a prominent brow will shadow a characters eyes thats why autodesk mudbox 2009 has texture painting tools and on target display features these will help artists build and refine better 3d models
1792069 the introduction of autodesk mudbox 2009 sparks a revolution in computer graphics tools bringing about a paradigm shift in how designers and artists do their work
1792070 time is money an autodesk mudbox session begins with its artist friendly intuitive interface this is sculpting at the speed of thought with the greatest of fidelity in a business where new ideas with impossible deadlines are commonplace mudbox never lets me down

1792083 obviously our government is not the same as the communist government in beijing
1792084 american legislators have been expressing outrage at chinas behavior but many of them voted to authorize the u s government to spy on american citizens americas reputation and its credibility to challenge other governments for human rights abuses has been badly damaged by the u s governments assault on the civil liberties and privacy of americans in our country

1792087 credo che peggio di cos non si potrebbe andare dopo la stagione delle stragi a seguito della quale lo stato fu costretto ad assumere delle posizioni dure si sono fatte nuovamente largo le posizioni del continente garantista allo stato attuale in atto un vero e proprio disfacimento di quella legislazione che consente ai giudici e alle forze dellordine di poter svolgere il proprio lavoro allinterno delle istituzioni si sono incuneate forze che seguono gli interessi della criminalit organizzata credo si possa fare un esempio su tutti marcello dellutri e inoltre in atto una operazione di delegittimazione nei confronti della magistratura e di assoggettamento del csm al potere politico le riforme previste per lorgano superiore della magistratura mirano proprio a questo ma io credo che non ce ne sia addirittura bisogno perch csm e magistratura si fanno gi abbastanza male da sole tramite le loro correnti che sono un vero e proprio cancro per la magistratura nel momento in cui alcuni magistrati hanno indagato sulle malefatte di destra e sinistra entrambi gli schieramenti politici tramite le correnti che in qualche modo pilotano hanno reagito cercando di ridurre al silenzio questi giudici

1792108 weak and lacking in competency because theyve outsourced many of the fundamental responsibilities of life
1792109 tripp believes that as biblical parents what we must truly control is not the actions but the heart of our children and to this end he advocates spanking children not for their actions but for what we interpret their heart to be he espouses that if we tie those heart strings then we will know the heart of our children and thus we must discipline for what we know of their heart and discipline until we turn their heart so what is the problem with this philosophy quite simply its the concept that we can be god to our children its a flawed and dangerous philosophy to believe that we can control the hearts of our children ultimately the decision to turn their heart to the lord must come from our children and will only come through the work of the lord himself in the hearts of his children
1792110 i will extol thee my god o king and i will bless thy name for ever and ever every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name for ever and ever great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts i will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and i will declare thy greatness they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness the lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy the lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works all thy works shall praise thee o lord and thy saints shall bless thee they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations the lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down the eyes of all wait upon thee and thou givest them their meat in due season thou openest thine hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing the lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works the lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them the lord preserveth all them that love him but all the wicked will he destroy my mouth shall speak the praise of the lord and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever

1792160 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
1792161 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1792162 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1792163 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities
1792164 there are a myriad of bragging points that can be filled in this blank really quality home schoolers do unit study or use a certain brand of curriculum or belong to a certain national or local training program or study classical literature or bake their own bread or do home births or refuse vaccinations or refuse social security numbers or do not participate in church youth groups or do not own a television or do not use birth control or the potential list is endless

1792167 maybe that is why there is so much one upmanship and vanity they are reading the wrong books

1792169 barton selects quotes from people like william penn to the effect that
1792170 bartons pseudo history and laughable abuse of statistics ought to be an embarrassment to those christian right leaders now trying to claim a mainstream mantle but bartons popularity should not be dismissed because it points to what motivates much of the movements following here we have a group of people who mix separatism with the belief that christians narrowly defined ought to have dominion over secular society this is a movement that wants to have its cake and eat it too

1792203 international food demand has improved food profit margins to the point where farming can compete for capital with other up and coming sectors
1792204 theres always a risk that food demand could pull back slightly on a global economic slowdown but the long term factors are and will remain bullish
1792205 those two factors combined with the preference by growers to lower transportation costs by having more food distributed to closer markets where possible mean well continue to see an increase in farms and growing areas its not a cyclical thing its a structural change

1792208 an internet service fee would amount to a sizable amount of cash for airlines at 10 a passenger with say 100 of 180 or 190 passengers accessing the service thats an extra 1000 per flight which is significant
1792209 and this is one fee that the public will not react negatively to in my view
1792210 the public will use and really like in flight internet service weve become very used to being connected with the ability to communicate as well used to taking advantage of flying time for business tasks
1792211 it also represents another option besides reading or watching a movie during flights for a person like me it will be e mail city a big help
1792212 if they charge for it they are going to make millions and millions of dollars

1792216 sometimes when there is a formal event staff literally walk out right around the garden and back through another door so they dont interrupt what is going on
1792217 we will put a kitchen and good dining facility in his quarters so friends and family can come and stay and you dont always have the formal requests for meals

1792222 that in my opinion would be unworkable it would be a major major issue for the crusaders
1792223 its far better and simpler for franchises to contract their own players the crusaders should have a guarantee of knowing who their players are

1792258 the economic measures that the german government took to this effect were taken against the will of the occupying western powers only after they were applied was it seen how beneficial they were for the consolidation of a healthy currency and for german economic development

1792605 masuk dari jalur lambat pindah ke jalur cepat sesuai dengan jalurnya

1792670 i think i saw a guy get beat to death
1792671 he was kind of on his side with one arm behind his back and the other beneath him he was refusing to give them the arm both cops were standing crouched down a little because martins down on the ground ones kicking him in the torso area and the others punching him in the head
1792672 he was hitting him hard it was bone on bone i heard it i saw it
1792673 im in shock at this point its almost like i cant believe its happening i couldnt say or do anything and besides its your instinct not to get in the cops way
1792674 the guy who was hitting him in the head stopped and they were kind of wrestling
1792675 then the one who was kicking started hitting him with the club on the back of his legs id say 10 or 15 times and thats another modest estimate
1792676 his one leg had to be screwed up he got hit in that leg a bunch of times and then the same cop twisted his leg into like a q shape

1792690 no siempre se ha subrayado suficientemente la relaci n entre la ense anza de la iglesia sobre la redenci n y la creaci n este es un tema en el que los cristianos pueden practicar su fe dando ejemplo con estilos de vida respetuosos del medio ambiente
1792691 pero si se niega a dios el mundo se ve reducido a mera materia y en un mundo cerrado en su materialismo es m s f cil que el ser humano se erija como dictador de las dem s creaturas y de la naturaleza

1792720 no se sabe con exactitud qui n y como se cre el concepto de salud reproductiva
1792721 en el per el concepto de salud reproductiva viene siendo aceptado por dirigentes pol ticos y de la salud sin mayor an lisis y fundamentaci n propia acogiendo pasivamente los desarrollos argumentativos que provienen del exterior
1792722 lo real es que a trav s de la salud reproductiva se trata de promover lo que hoy conocemos como la
1792723 bajo el paraguas de la salud reproductiva se encubre entre otros prop sitos las esterilizaciones forzadas esconder informaci n sobre los efectos abortivos y secundarios de algunos anticonceptivos argumentar que el embarazo empieza en la implantaci n del vulo fecundado y no en la concepci n por ejemplo para aprobar la p ldora del d a siguiente y tratar de evitar el derecho a la objeci n de conciencia de los m dicos en la legislaci n sobre salud
1792724 el tratamiento que se da a la salud reproductiva en los parlamentos y los medios tiene bastante en com n con el seguido para otras materias vinculadas con la misma como son los derechos sexuales derechos reproductivos salud sexual despenalizaci n del aborto g nero perspectiva de g nero diversidad sexual matrimonio homosexual anticoncepci n de emergencia
1792725 las iniciativas sobre las materias mencionadas cobran la forma de proyectos de ley normas de diferente rango planes y programas congresos y seminarios que buscan la adhesi n de autoridades l deres pol ticos y gobiernos a nivel central regional y local colegios profesionales a fin de que la idea de la salud reproductiva alcance legitimidad social y legal
1792726 para llevar adelante sus prop sitos los gobiernos de los pa ses desarrollados y las grandes fundaciones filantr picas asentadas en estos realizan m ltiples acciones a nivel mundial mediante el apoyo pol tico y la financiaci n de organizaciones tanto de naciones unidas principalmente el fondo de poblaci n unfpa la organizaci n mundial de la salud oms y el fondo de la onu para la infancia unicef como de ongs constituidas para estos fines en los pa ses pobres
1792727 en los pa ses latinoamericanos act an a trav s de organizaciones feministas en el per por ejemplo a trav s de manuela ramos y flora trist n que dicen representar a las mujeres y tratan de ocupar posiciones estrat gicas en los sectores de educaci n salud y el parlamento haciendo lobby ante las autoridades y los medios de comunicaci n

1792731 tal vez la prensa de entonces no tom en cuenta que pablo vi tom de la mano al concilio vaticano ii luego de su primera sesi n llev ndolo a una positiva conclusi n y promulgando todos los documentos aprobados para cuya final aprobaci n dedic personal atenci n e intervenciones precisas
1792732 quiso volver en tierra santa sobre los pasos de cristo y que visit por primera vez todos los continentes es adem s el papa de la ecclesiam suam de la populorum progressio de la octogesima adveniens y de la evangelii nuntiandi para citar solo algunos de sus documentos

1792954 ive also learned the law is skewed against the private landowner they condemn your land and then they set a price for it in return all you can do is try to fight at your own expense the law enables them to break you in my situation the county commissioners went out and got my property appraised for 2 million a sum millions below the real market value then they tried to make me accept it

1792966 the idea came out of a desire to do a different type of improv show i have been in and seen lots of shows that have a gimmick or theme that is supposed to make them different but falls short for example you might sese a show called pirateprov where the show is set on a pirate ship or all the characters are pirates but the show uaually comes down to a basic improv show i thought that by changing the premise of who the characters are at their core it would force the show to be different and create a unique experience for the audience in this case the audience gets a glimpse into what each cast member thinks they are like or how they act
1792967 all of the people i chose for the cast are people that i have done shows with in the past or are friends with many of us came up through the classes at magnet theater together and have been on teams together i thought it was really important to select a cast that knew each other and in some cases knew each other very well i carefully selected each of them based on certain personality types and traits i saw in thier improv work that i felt would go well with the concept of self image all of the people in the cast have truthfulness in their performance style
1792968 to be honst with you after our first rehearsals we were surprised at how easy it seemed to be the biggest challenge we face is that we tend to complicate the show i think that is an issue that many people have with life as well when things are going well we tend to complicate things or make them harder the simplicity of the show allows us to explore in depth the areas of our personalities that the audience uaually find the most enetertaining
1792969 yes they do our format lends itself to evnvironments that we can all belong to i e rommates co workers although we have gotten into some abstract or more fanciful environments as well in a past show we literally got into castmember corey grimes head and explored the depths of his psyche
1792970 i dont see a line between true to self and true to the moment if you are truly in the moment as yourself that line can not exist especially in this show we do however find it a challenge to do support work in a scene as yourself if two of us are in a restaurant scene we are going to most likely need a waiter waitress at that point a cast member as themself needs to step in and be that watier waitress which actually creates some interesting justifications and interactions
1792971 yes it does we kind of have a policy of full disclosure about our personal lives each rehearsal involves a lot of questions about each other and some down time for chatting i like to have our director come a half and hour later to rehearsal than the cast so that we can have that time together
1792972 i would agree that the better we get to know each other the easier it is to anticipate each others actions i think that is key to our show at times you find your self anticipating a move from your scene partner and i have found that in self image i often surprised and shocked at a reaction when they make a different move than i expect that makes for some great stage moments and great discoveries about each other
1792973 absolutely that is really why i created this show a challenge that all improvisors face is finding truth in their work this show forces us not only to find it but to share it with the audience and each other we start each show by having the audience ask the cast a very personal question we then answer the question as a group and sometimes a little discussion even breaks out on stage this serves as our inspiration for the show i feel that by using our answers and real information gathered during the opening we immediately ground the show in truth and that is always the best place to start a comedy show from i would just like to say how happy i am to come back to philadelphia to do this show since i moved from philly to nyc two and half years ago i have had the opportunity to perform there several times but this is the first time i am bringing a show that i created down most of the cast have been to philly to perform in the philadelphia improv festival or at one of phits showcases and they are equally excited we want to thank phit for hosting us

1792981 while blu ray discs bd offering both 25gb and 50gb are sufficient for users current demands we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as streaming in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content
1792982 the multi layered method is compatible with blu ray devices providing a long term future for the technology and is more easily produced when compared to competing technologies such as holographic storage

1792986 the mpaa is staring right in the face of a paradox and they must make a choice
1792987 they can continue to invest in the war on digital piracy as opposed to physical dvd piracy which can be monitored and slowed by confiscating actual dvds and duplication equipment or they can invest in promoting the fun of going to the movies
1792988 invest in a positive message that can get people more excited about their member products and the unique experience offered in theaters
1792989 i get a daily report of all the torrents and other files available online
1792990 you know what i think about that so what thats what i think its collateral damage
1792991 indirectly add to the costs of education and university research introduce new security and privacy issues degrade existing rights under copyright and have little or no lasting impact on infringement of copyrighted works
1792992 we congratulate congressional leaders for including a common sense provision that will help protect the integrity of taxpayer funded university networks and encourage college fans to enjoy legal music and movies
1792993 we work closely with leaders in the higher education community because we both have a stake in ensuring that intellectual property continues to be a strong vibrant part of our nations economy
1792994 our objective is always to encourage encourage college students and all consumers to find the content they want from the many legitimate options available by including these important provisions in the higher education act congress is sending a strong message that intellectual property is worth protecting we look forward to working with colleges and universities to raise awareness of the legal alternatives to piracy

1793039 yes abigal what is it like being a vampire why are you so cold
1793040 i dont exactly remember i was walking home one day and out of nowhere something came up behind me and strangled me i tried to fight it but it had unexplainable force i was outbeat after that i remember waking up in the middle of an alley my body was blaring it felt as if i was on fire and no matter what i did i couldnt excape the horrible feeling i looked at my hand even though my vision was blurry and it burned and i saw to tiny dots right below my wrist im stupid i told myself there are no such things as vampires or warewolfs but then i thought maybe that would explain this pain i felt i layed there in the alley suffering of this unexplainable pain i thought about going to a doctor but then i remembered that i might not be normal any more as i once had been like you my mom didnt care much for me she was addicted to heroine and as for my dad he died a couple months before i was born leaving my mom alone when i was born she used to never come home i remember when i was really little maybe three or four years old my mom would leave me in the house starved i had nothing but the small scraps i would find of food everyone in awhile on the floor in the kitchen it tasted nasty but pleasured my stomach so therefore i ate what i could find after i started school things began to change a little bit i barley had clothes so i would go to school in the same clothes almost everyday because we wore uniform no one noticed i made didnt have friends i was the kid who was silent and never spoke not even to the teacher lunch time was my favorite time of all because it was the only time i would ever eat i would go to school early so i could get breakfast too i became ammune to school it was like a drug to me when everyone was dismissed i would hide in the closet door by my classroom where no one looked and would sleep i also loved reading even though i was 5 years old i was able to read chapter books of a 8th grade level even though i was silent i got perfect grades no one took the time to talk to me because i felt like i had lost my voice like i couldnt talk i would get my awards get thanked and congradulated then woud be ignored it was like that till 9th grade one day i finally decided to go home and my mom wasnt there the apartment had been up for sale and there was nothing left of the little we had i was 15 years old and alone i depended on books to make me happy they were like a getaway to me i would read and picture these great fabulous worlds where nothing bad ever happened and everyone was happy i was changed at 15 that is why i still look as one when i got over the horrible pain which lasted 3 days of agony that i could not explain i was found by emily and james they wernt normal humans i noticed that they took me away from the cold dark alley and gave me a home they cared for me then explained to me what i was i found it quite weird that they knew what i was because they were the same they went over what i was feeling and how i would have to resist my hunger and not feed on humans at first i was confused then i got used to it and became experted in it you see when i first saw you i got this feeling i had never talked to any human before but when i met you i couldnt help but to say something you see abigal for the very first time in my whole life i actually felt as if there was a need to talk to a human and when i heard your soft smooth beautiful voice and saw through you what you had gone through your entire life i fell in love with you
1793041 take my hand abigal this place is very important to me

1793045 the girl removed her lips from abigals neck and began to stare intensly at her
1793046 now you know what im talking about the boy had no reason to harm him he was doing nothing but looking for something to eat and what he gets out of it is a hopeless fight and burned to ashes
1793047 and now i want revenge for you have killed my only brother
1793048 get off of her she has done nothing to you if you want to hurt anyone its me
1793049 i thought i told you not to leave the house
1793050 i wasnt going to leave i was going to go up to my room and just wait for you to come talk to me but
1793051 what would possibly make you leave the house and end up all alone in the middle of a road in a night like this your so clueless do you realize if i hadnt of came here you would of been dead
1793052 i didnt notice what i was doing i blanked out and as soon as i knew it i was running away from home i didnt even mean to leave i walked in the house and there my mom was sitting on the couch like everything was perfectly fine smiling that smile i despise i didnt know what else to do and froze then ended up in the street i need to leave or else i wouldve went insane i hate her and i never want to see her again she almost ruined me and now she wants to make it worst with showing up
1793053 im so sorry for yelling at you like that i was just angry i dont know if i would be able to live if something was ever to happen to you
1793054 it will be okay we will figure something out i promise

1793173 i kept being asked by medical staff if i was okay with donating my kidney and i was because i would make the sacrifice and give both of them to my son if it meant i could give him the quality of life he deserves

1793177 the day of the operation was the worst day of my life as they were both in surgery for hours and i didnt know how they would be

1793186 amy did return to hospital after her glastonbury performance but her doctors recommended that she continue as an outpatient she was allowed to leave for the performances and it was felt that this went really well as her treatment is coming to a close it was decided she should return home
1793187 we felt so violated we had entrusted these people welcomed them into the most intimate parts of our home and this was how they could treat us
1793188 the repercussions of such actions could have been catastrophic publicly linking our home address with our sexuality could have ruined our lives
1793189 the treatment of ms dobinson and ms richards was wholly unacceptable and i am pleased that both women have been compensated for what must have been a very distressing experience
1793190 it is a reminder to companies that discrimination on the grounds of sexuality will not be tolerated by the gay community and it is encouraging that jackson stops and staff has taken positive steps to ensure this type of incident is not repeated
1793191 we very much regret the incident which occurred as a result of the actions of an individual member of staff
1793192 as an employer and a leading provider of estate agency services we take equality issues extremely seriously

1793225 schlozman was reshaping the civil rights division schlozman didnt know anything about voting law all he knew is he wanted to be sure that the republicans were going to win
1793226 unsubstantiated or false claims by the loser of a close race mischief and administrative or voter error
1793227 there is virtually no evidence that voter fraud ever occurs except by individuals and in rare instances
1793228 broke with established department policy by getting involved with contentious and partisan litigation on the eve of the election mr von spakovsky drafted legal briefs between the republican and democratic parties in three battleground states ohio michigan and florida just before the election all in favor of the republican partys position
1793229 these briefs ran counter to the well established practice of the civil rights division not to inject itself into litigation or election monitoring on the eve of an election where it would be viewed as expressing a political preference or could have an impact on a political dispute
1793230 they cooked up that there is a general exception to the policy because they wanted to prevent more fraud but indicting people before the election was not going to change anything registration had already closed there just wasnt a justification for bending the law
1793231 federal prosecutors and investigators should be extremely careful not to conduct overt investigations during the pre election period or while the elections are underway
1793232 a criminal investigation by armed badged federal agents runs the obvious risk of chilling legitimate voting and campaign activities
1793233 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan

1793243 no archaeological find has ever refuted a biblical claim and thousands of finds have confirmed in general and in detail the biblical picture

1793261 he is not a united states citizen he does not have the right that citizens of the united states possess
1793262 but at least what we think about you is true haha
1793263 its not me and my irrational anger its them its them
1793264 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
1793265 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
1793266 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
1793267 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
1793268 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
1793269 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
1793270 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
1793271 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
1793272 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
1793273 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
1793274 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
1793275 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
1793276 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
1793277 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
1793278 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
1793279 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
1793280 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
1793281 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
1793282 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
1793283 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
1793284 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
1793285 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
1793286 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage

1793296 dont say yes dont say no dont tell your sob story when i call your number say available or application
1793297 youve got these people prancing around in wigs trying to get a headline jurors see all that theyre not stupid they are treated as stupid theyre being paid as though theyre stupid but its that they dont trust lawyers they dont trust the system
1793298 the jurors are challenging the system they are saying its no longer good enough we want to be paid more we expect a better service from the judiciary we expect to be better informed we expect not to be sent out of the courtroom every 10 minutes because two lawyers want to have an argument were being excluded at every turn here and yet were still expected to make a decision on whether someones guilty or not guilty
1793299 if they are prepared to take risks in a trial as sensitive and as serious as the wood trial then the system needs to look at itself and ask why they are prepared to take those risks

1793314 man h tte sie aber nicht so photographieren sollen finde ich ich sehe sowas ungern

1793351 it keeps things in perspective for me theres a lot more to life than the olympic games and having learnt that lesson really quickly has helped keep this whole event in perspective

1793363 aprenderemos algo sobre wilson aprenderemos algo sobre house y aprenderemos algo sobre su relaci n pero no creo que nadie espere que wilson se vaya de la serie la relaci n entre house y wilson es genial pero est bien desordenarla y poco y jugar con ella
1793364 originalmente s lo bamos a quedarnos con dos despu s subimos a tres y finalmente acabamos con cuatro
1793365 consigui ser la novia de wilson y consigui la gran escena de la muerte
1793366 infrautilizamos a chase y cameron parec a lo natural despu s de tres a os no iban a quedarse con house para siempre nos gustan y queremos usarlos fue por eso por lo que no nos deshicimos de ellos tenerlos a los tres en su equipo no era natural por lo que los pusimos en el hospital y para serte sincero estamos buscando maneras de utilizarlos ya hemos encontrado mejores formas de hacerlo en la quinta temporada pero todo est en progreso
1793367 vamos a tocar m s su relaci n foreman va a traer un caso en el que van a trabajar independientemente de house y ella le va a traer un caso propio a house

1793371 no puedes romper la f rmula si no tienes una es muy importante que hagamos los episodios normales realmente bien
1793372 no creo que estemos rompiendo la f rmula estamos haciendo algo diferente con la f rmula pero todos estos cap tulos en el fondo eran de gente necesitando un diagn stico esa es la columna vertebral de la serie los dos ltimos cap tulos se salieron de la f rmula pero el resto de la temporada fue bastante de la f rmula

1793399 in any group of 10 people at least 9 are sure to believe they are qualified to offer advice to others and in no field of human interest are people as ready to offer advise as in the field of religion and morals yet it is precisely in this field that the average person is least qualified to speak wisely and is capable of the most harm when he she does speak for this reason we should select our counselors carefully
1793400 no man has any right to offer advice who has not first heard god speak no man has any right to counsel others who is not ready to hear and follow the counsel of the lord true moral wisdom must always be an echo of gods voice the only safe light for our path is the light which is reflected from christ the light of the world

1793416 when a child can simply be handed from one legal guardian to another with little or no scrutiny of the new guardians background there is a problem here
1793417 child welfare has whats thought to be a pretty strict screening process
1793418 any time a child dies under these circumstances we as a community as a society have something to learn
1793419 the tragic death of katelynn points to flaws in our child protection system
1793420 the government must take immediate action to toughen child protection as we wait for an inquest

1793436 i need to speak to latitia she has to put off the wedding
1793437 you have got to be joking latitias been working on the wedding non stop for months shes going to need a damned good reason to call it off this close to the day the church is booked and everything
1793438 wrack said that was absolute rubbish what we do know is that hes into some pretty nasty stuff hes got an imp carving magical symbols into a skull for a start hes the one making a homunculus
1793439 it sounds pretty far fetched how does all this tie in with pennie
1793440 shes connected somehow she just happens to have the papers in her house she just happens to be divorced from the scientist working there what about her boyfriend
1793441 her other boyfriend i saw him talking to a strange woman tonight what was that all about
1793442 how should i know all she told me was they spent the day together and he had to leave suddenly she didnt want to be in her flat on her own so she called me
1793443 but you felt fine about her sleeping in your bed where youve shagged untold numbers of women
1793444 i cant believe you think sams an evil mastermind though ive known him for ten years he got me this job
1793445 say what you like about sam hes as thick as two short planks with a plank sandwiched between them
1793446 and yet hes the director of a top secret research facility
1793447 i remember when i met sam the first time he was still giggling about fart jokes
1793448 almost as if something was controlling him from the inside
1793449 then suddenly hes the director of twilight and he gives you a piss ant job as a security guard
1793450 i read and i sketch at least they didnt give me the crappy night watchs job nothing happens at night its like working in a mausoleum
1793451 the sam you knew is long gone whatever is directing the twilight operations hasnt been sam for a very long time you cant let your sister marry him it whatever
1793452 are you telling me to stop latitia from doing something if you are you know a different latitia to me
1793453 i smelled the anxiety in the house but i thought it was winston
1793454 that the man im about to marry is possessed of course i know
1793455 hes the best lover i ever had theres no way the original sam was that good when all his experience came from the how to pages of a soft porn mag
1793456 when he first asked me out i did a reading on him
1793457 yes it showed he wasnt what he seemed to be but didnt give me any indication what he treated me well so i didnt bother about it
1793458 why should it nobody cares when people marry christ your friend valerie for one she was a nun wasnt she
1793459 a god that does nothing but condemn you to everlasting torment or a demon that gives you anything you could wish for and better sex than a mortal man ever could
1793460 but lying to me about my chances for redemption isnt one of them look at me im the daughter of a catholic father and a voudoun priestess i pray to the virgin mary and the maitresse erzulie i read tea leaves tarot cards and the occasional spirit i predict the future by picking tiles from a bag and i make love tokens and bottled curses any one of those things would damn me to the pits if i was married to a saint marrying a demon wont do me any harm at all
1793461 how come youve booked a church for the wedding though isnt that a bit of a problem for a demonically possessed groom
1793462 he doesnt seem to think so he told me that demons only suffer in churches if they intend to do harm he intends to marry me so what harm is that
1793463 this is absolutely fascinating what tiles to you pick out of bags to tell the future with runes i ching witch stones
1793464 dont get me wrong ive tried all the others but theyre open to too much interpretation i mean you pick out an ushi tile that means a stranger is coming and how do you interpret that a new lover or a man to read the electricity meter worse still you tell someone its a new lover and it turns out to be a bailiff who takes their television
1793465 i started using lettered tiles accidentally when i was compiling a crossword a stranger is coming makes a lot more sense when you can tell your client hes a plumber called dave coming to fix their tap and hes already married with seven kids
1793466 i added extra letters and number tiles to me bag it makes for easier readings though what muse of prophesy works in text speak im not quite certain
1793467 hes here isnt he he was with you when we arrived
1793468 and i was most gratified to hear you talking so nicely about me
1793469 you are coming to the wedding arent you latitia and i want you to come after were married well all be one big happy family
1793470 we were in love one morning he told me to pack my things we were going to run off together i waited but he never showed up

1793480 we get the well documented puzzle that u s happiness hasnt risen
1793481 the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined
1793482 why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do
1793483 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
1793484 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
1793485 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
1793486 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
1793487 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
1793488 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream
1793489 now we have to look elsewhere for this energy source
1793490 elpida has combined low power technology and high density stacking technology to achieve the worlds largest capacity 16 gigabyte fb dimm
1793491 we believe our new dimm product is an excellent response to server market demand for example from data center customers for low power and high density performance elpida continues to focus on developing products featuring superior low power high density characteristics

1793493 the amd 790gx chipset contains several amd innovations that further improves both multi core amd phenom processor performance and motherboard ati radeon graphics performance the result of which are versatile performance pcs that deliver an eye catching visual experience
1793494 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
1793495 our results show that carbon dioxide induced acidification of seawater at levels predicted for the year 2100 reduced fertilisation success of an ecologically dominant marine species by 25 per cent
1793496 what we have now is evidence that the worlds marine life is far more sensitive to ocean acidification than first suspected and that means our oceans may be very different places in the not too distant future
1793497 our results strongly suggest that the reason that some children who have been given antibiotics appear to develop asthma is because they had a chest infection and the symptoms of the chest infection in young children can be confused with the start of asthma
1793498 antibiotics are given to treat the respiratory condition and rather than being a cause of asthma as has been previously suggested they are used for chest infections which can indicate an increased risk of asthma or be mistaken for it
1793499 our data still leaves open the possibility that antibiotics may affect the development of eczema and itchy skin by four years and allergic hypersensitivity by 15 months
1793500 some heart failure patients spend a lot of time in and out of the hospital due to chest pain and trouble breathing
1793501 at any time such as when the subject is beginning to feel poorly we immediately get readings of pulmonary pressure we are hopeful we can avoid a hospitalization by adjusting the subjects medication based on the pressure recording as we evaluate the cardiomems wireless pressure monitoring system we see great potential to increase convenience to patients and hospital efficiency by cutting back on frequent trips to the emergency room
1793502 to know how this happens at the molecular level how things bounce skip spin tumble push and pull represents a big leap in our understanding
1793503 they dont want to break down it takes a long time for wood to rot it even takes termites a long time to break wood down and theyre pretty good at it ethanol producers face the same problem because of the way these molecules are arranged its difficult to get access to the reactive centers in wood and other biomass what we have done is to study some of the most basic reactions associated with the breakdown of these materials
1793504 small but significant step toward maximizing the efficiency of biomass utilization
1793505 reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries has been the focus for the international community since the united nations climate change conference in bali last december but this is also an issue for australia
1793506 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1793507 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the c02 released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the carbon stored in natural forests is a larger and more reliable stock than the carbon stored in commercially logged forests and plantations
1793508 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
1793509 this is not a get out of jail free card

1793514 our energy and enthusiasm overrides the fact that the executives are relatively young in comparison with most organizations however we are focused on integrating ourselves within the core functions of the business school and gaining insight that would come only with time
1793515 we want to solicit more involvement from the kelley schools 36 student organizations which will hopefully broaden our reach and increase our effectiveness
1793516 ten hours of interviewing left me amazed this da class is unbelievable the executive team is excited to tap into their talent
1793517 im energized by the positive momentum of kelley ksg has unique privileges and i look to leverage those powers to add the most value to this school

1793595 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
1793596 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
1793597 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
1793598 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
1793599 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
1793600 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
1793601 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
1793602 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again
1793603 the courts run by the government are active around the country
1793604 if israeli u s or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
1793605 israel takes iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads statements regarding its destruction seriously israel cannot risk another holocaust
1793606 for israel this is not a target that cannot be achieved
1793607 actually increasing the nationalist fervor to build a nuclear weapon
1793608 a two three year delay is not worth it for a five to 10 year delay i would say yes

1793612 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1793613 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1793614 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible

1793619 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1793621 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1793622 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1793623 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1793624 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1793625 when i read about dave campos piloting the easy rider and taking the record from my old friend don vesco in 1989 i began to wonder what a couple of blown vincents could do to the record

1793637 if im at the optimum weight to muscle ratio i am more efficient in gods eyes
1793638 wanting to please him upstairs is also vanity so its a win win situation for me of course being on the chunky side is being thankful for his bounty so who am i to judge

1793668 as he has since january this week barack obama enjoyed much more visibility as far as the public was concerned than did john mccain by a margin of 76 to 11 respondents in pews weekly news interest index survey named obama over mccain as the candidate they have heard the most about in recent days but the same poll also shows that the democratic candidates media dominance may not be working in his favor close to half 48 of pews interviewees went on to say that they have been hearing too much about obama lately and by a slight but statistically significant margin 22 to 16 people say that recently they have a less rather than more favorable view of the putative democratic nominee
1793669 she is only 19 all the time she is constantly using it as an excuse anyways things got really bad this week so bad that manny and i both got kicked out wtf right

1793684 the situation in drug testing labs worldwide must be remedied
1793685 cheaters evade detection innocents are falsely accused and sport is ultimately suffering
1793686 what we are doing in the area of doping is the most advanced in terms of certitude
1793687 it is proper to establish threshold values such as these but only to define a hypothesis a positive test criterion requires further investigation of known samples
1793688 there were concerns that bnp was not addressing subprime concerns properly but the bank has shown that was not the case
1793689 very difficult to get the good result of the previous year in 2008
1793690 though the second quarter results were better than expected the german economy is set to decline in 2009 and 2010

1793697 for nearly two months weve lived on a combat outpost with a platoon of their soldiers the etts were the only u s presence on our makeshift compound
1793698 generally classes in the morning are taught by the ett and classes in the afternoon are taught by the ana
1793699 we typically meet with the kandak commander after formation to discuss any issues or problems throughout the day the trainers are meeting and working with their companies
1793700 no day is a typical day with the ana it can change dramatically from day to day
1793701 this fob will help bring stability to the entire region weve merely shown them the way they are the ones doing the work
1793702 every mission that we go on is augmented by the ana
1793703 this allows the citizens of afghanistan to see members of their army working professionally with coalition forces it contributes to a sense of overwhelming pride in their government and they see their army progressing and succeeding in stamping out the taliban
1793704 many of the soldiers in 4th kandak learn combat skills fast training them and letting them handle explosives and teaching them to respect it will help strengthen their ability and national perception
1793705 we are getting the ana to a point where they can be self sufficient
1793706 we pass all our experience and knowledge on to them they do for themselves and it is working

1793711 you cannot wait until 2015 to work on the shortage of health workers if youre interested in the mdgs fill this gap now in the next to three years only then do we have some hope of achieving these targets
1793712 otherwise you can forget these goals its simply not possible
1793713 there is a clear correlation between the pace of antiretroviral rollout and the shortage of health workers
1793714 the original productions team aired a halloween special featuring our makeup effects and the next thing i know theyre coming to us with this zombie project

1793716 i couldnt help writing max and phil segals son noah into the story both kids will be at comic con and theyll probably get more requests for autographs than i will
1793717 so when thom came to me and wanted to put zombie parts all over a bike it was a whole new direction for us thom is the only guy i know who can take a chopper like ours cover it in blood and guts and still have a piece of machinery thats beautiful
1793718 this chopper has the old school styling you expect from exile with truly frightening zombie effects created by rob at almost human its hardcore ugly
1793719 i worked with russell on biker build off and when i began writing the graphic novel i knew exactly who was going to build the bike when phil segal introduced me to rob and his guys over at almost human the whole project came together im psyched to have a chopper that reflects the books visual and dramatic intensity
1793720 high level transportation officials from around the world attended this conference to discuss motorcycling and motorcycle safety so it was critical that motorcyclists made their voices heard
1793721 based on many of the recommendations i feel we succeeded
1793722 quite often these types of meetings occur in a vacuum devoid of the opinions and perspective of the people most impacted by the topics discussed
1793723 this meeting was particularly significant because the real world perspective of riders was given equal weight and our input was recognized on a global stage
1793724 im incredibly honored and excited to be nominated for an espy award
1793725 im really looking forward to be being at the awards show at the nokia theatre l a live in los angeles on july 1th and hoping to represent womens motocross by winning it

1793737 the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behaviour unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside
1793738 it is probably fair to say that as late as the summer of 2007 virtually none of us would have imagined that as of july 2008 financial sector write offs and loss provisions would approach 500bn even as the write off meter is still running

1793838 i dont think whocanisue com is going to by itself increase the number of lawsuits there are but it may make people more aware of what their rights are

1793844 there is also evidence to suggest that smoking restrictions help smokers who are trying to quit

1793850 we also know that second hand cigarette smoke is dangerous to peoples health

1793884 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
1793885 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

1793907 this is written for pediatricians pediatric cardiologists and others who take care of children with hypertension its meant to be an up to date compilation of the literature around abpm providing a blueprint for how abpm should be used for the evaluation of such children
1793908 one of the big questions in pediatrics is whether high blood pressure is a white coat phenomenon or not and abpm is one of the important ways in which we can get a better understanding of this
1793909 there hasnt been as much of a focus on pediatric monitoring and that is what we wanted to address
1793910 there is now sufficient experience with abpm to recommend its use in pediatric patients to assist in diagnosing hypertension
1793911 it is clear that abpm is useful in the evaluation of bp levels in youth however there is a need for larger data sets and additional data will also be important in evaluating the efficacy of abpm in measuring effects of interventions and reversal of target organ damage
1793912 these guidelines help pediatric healthcare providers to understand the use of abpm in monitoring childrens blood pressure
1793913 ambulatory monitoring is likely to be most useful in children whose office blood pressure readings are up to 10 over the highest acceptable reading as children with very high readings more than 10 higher than the highest reading are more likely to have true high blood pressure
1793914 a common scenario is that you get bps in the clinic that you are worried about and you may have tried some nonpharmacologic interventions with diet and physical activity for example but you are left with a bp that is still higher that youd like many people before taking the plunge to use medication would consider an abpm test to get a better handle on whether the clinic bp is a true reflection of the bp
1793915 greater leisure time activity and walking were associated with graded lower incidence of af with progressively lower risk as both leisure time activity and distances and paces of walking increased
1793916 conversely intensity of exercise had a u shaped relationship with af with lower risk among individuals exercising with moderate but not high intensity
1793917 these results suggest that long term benefits for af risk of light to moderate physical activities in older adults outweigh any potentially higher risks of af associated with the short term activity or exercise
1793918 potential preventive measures to reduce the incidence of af in the particularly high risk and growing population of older adults

1794160 the parking structure was a challenge from the start due to the ground water issues that arose in the beginning our team worked seven days a week drilling seven wells to drain the flooded pad and dewater the site we had to run those wells 24 7 throughout the rainy season to keep the ground water out
1794161 the team has had to think outside the box in dealing with the timing and technical issues that have come up we have worked a lot of night shifts and weekends in order to stay on schedule at the same time our team has done a great job of staying focused on quality and safety

1794164 that every year since the studys inception in 2002 critical illness has made the list of expected growth products yet sales over the past few years have been somewhat slow
1794165 carriers seem to have a love hate relationship with critical illness products
1794166 on the one hand they continue to select the product as a growth product but on the other hand they often name it as the product that has not grown as expected
1794167 we have seen a trend for carriers to choose one or more of their core voluntary products life or disability as growth products for their company but they believe that the industry as a whole will be growing through some of the newer products like limited benefit plans

1794171 they pretty much had all the territory in the first 20 minutes and we just struggled to get into the game
1794172 a lot of it was based around me not calling the right play and some of the boys not being in the right places
1794173 i was quite disappointed with how i went on the weekend and pat coach lam was as well and weve talked about that and there are some things that i really need to step up to and bring to the team a lot better
1794174 the disappointing thing was that when we watched the video we recognised that everyone didnt front as individuals and more importantly as a team and we were embarrassed by that
1794175 a lot of the guys who left had played over 50 games and thats what you lose
1794176 im certain that the guys who played last weekend have learnt from what happened and now we need to put it together as a team

1794181 its going to be quite difficult me and jimmy used to go diving a lot together and hang out quite a bit so its going to be funny seeing my old team mate playing for another province and running out against him
1794182 i know jimmy though he will get up for the game and try and do his best and prove a point
1794183 he knows what were capable of doing and how we play so hell try and change the way he plays and come up with something different

1794373 if youre giving out two prizes theyre going to bellow and roth three then its bellow and roth and ozick
1794374 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
1794375 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
1794376 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
1794377 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
1794378 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever
1794379 i have tried to be careful never to say the risen book was irrelevant ive said it was a factor in reopening the discussion
1794380 for information about the rally or what else you can do to fight the genocide see with african union peacekeepers scheduled to leave darfur at the end of this month and the sudanese government mounting a military campaign against helpless and starving darfurians the horrific situation there may very well turn even worse for hundreds of thousands of people
1794381 i couldnt imagine somebody like osama bin laden understanding the joy of channukah
1794382 leftists excoriated susan sontag for implying that the assault was payback for americas crimes

1794387 cause of death lies extremism incompetence corruption murder torture and hypocrisy stupidity and even more lies
1794388 the great red zone that voted for bush is clearly ready for war the decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead and may well mount a fifth column
1794389 theyre barmy laws the laws are just silly theyve got to sort it out
1794390 we had the idea for the bar as my other half is polish and ive visited poland many times and speak the language
1794391 weve a great crowd who come in here people from the town and people from poland
1794392 they find this all rather amusing they never realised it was illegal to drink beer in litres rather than pints
1794393 in the uk free flow beer must be sold in stamped pint or half pint glasses this ensures consistency all over the country
1794394 who is that guy i had my picture made with anyway
1794395 theres a line in the sand just below 117 if you close below that it signals traders are giving up on the bull market in oil
1794396 subsequent rallies may take us higher but the highs for the year have probably been put in
1794397 i think we need to drop another 30 or 40 cents a gallon before we really see any change in driving habits
1794398 it couldnt have gone better for me and i am settling in well already
1794399 mourinho asked me for more intensity and i feel i provided that but i have to thank the team for putting me in a position to score
1794400 it was a good win considering the bundesliga will start soon we select games like these because we dont want four or five nil wins
1794401 i really like the way the team is starting to come together and there is a noticeable empathy between the players
1794402 he has shown his true feelings for his colleagues but i want to leave it at that
1794403 mistakes happen in football but i have never made an error like that before
1794404 now i am just thinking of training well and i dont think it would be fair to judge me on one performance
1794405 i could hear a pro and a con emerging from that discussion
1794406 some arguing that it would enhance exalt the groups standing historically others arguing that it would be a disaster
1794407 they would have to come to a conclusion i believe where they would justify the use of a nuclear or some other weapon of mass destruction in what they would consider rational terms
1794408 in other words how it would help them fulfill specific goals they have which i think are well established
1794409 there have been a number of very important strategic writings disseminated by the internet where they look at current american strategy and then they assess what their interests are and weigh the calculations
1794410 does this help them or hurt them does it help us or hurt us
1794411 that type of example that we will react violently if the cost to the united states is high enough shapes the way they calculate whether or not to use weapons of mass destruction in the future
1794412 theres a certain threshold of pain were willing to accept and if you exceed it we will respond aggressively and i think they are trying to keep the pain that theyre inflicting on us below a certain threshold at this point
1794413 using a nuclear device in the u s the strategists within al qaida know would cause such a backlash that it may not actually be in their strategic interest to do that right now
1794414 i personally think that even a terrorist group using a nuclear weapon would not be able to accomplish any objectives if they think through the problem properly
1794415 it would plunge the world into a place that i believe ultimately would not serve interests any more than it would serve a state who would use a nuclear weapon but ill to leave that up to al qaida i do feel confident they have that intent and that is the intent we worry about
1794416 i could hear a pro and a con emerging from that discussion
1794417 some arguing that it would enhance exalt the groups standing historically others arguing that it would be a disaster

1794427 we made progress in the quarter but we are far from satisfied
1794428 weve not turned the corner yet and ive been clear that this will take some time
1794429 collectively these actions will reduce our gross add production of customers but should improve our profitability over time
1794430 there are clear signs of improvement at sprint yet there remains no clear answer on how the company can ever return to growth or reasonable profit margins
1794431 its an attempt by certain western countries to internationalise the darfur problem for their own political ends
1794432 i reject the turning over of any african leader to the court
1794433 there are positive indications that the crisis will be resolved
1794434 security in sudan is considered a major part of egyptian national security
1794435 egypt plays an important role in keeping the peace in sudan both in the south and in darfur
1794436 the court is mandated with prosecuting individuals leaders and high ranking officials rather than governments parties or political regimes
1794437 sudan like egypt has signed the charter but its parliament has not ratified it until now
1794438 the courts jurisdiction extends to any country whether an icc signatory or not if the un security council citing a threat to international peace and security requests that the court investigate crimes committed in that country
1794439 this is why sudans claim that as a non signatory to the icc the court lacks jurisdiction is not legally accurate
1794440 historically the lack of development rather than ethnic differences has been at the root of the conflict
1794441 the west only began turning it into an international issue after the discovery of uranium and petroleum in darfur
1794442 considerable evidence of a u s french and israeli presence in darfur which has promoted rebel activity
1794443 if the rebels had not been supported and emboldened by these foreign groups the crisis would have been resolved five years ago
1794444 some humanitarian agencies in darfur are doing brisk business by inflating the numbers of victims and refugees to obtain more funding from the international community
1794445 such exaggerations also serve the ends of the foreign powers that want to internationalise the problem with the aim of dividing sudan
1794446 first sudan could simply turn al bashir over to the court
1794447 but if it refuses to do so the icc can request a un security council resolution under chapter 7 of the un charter to impose gradual sanctions on sudan
1794448 but could eventually escalate into a naval blockade of the country and then in a worst case scenario the use of military power to force sudan into compliance with icc demands
1794449 the un security council decision was a good omen for khartoum
1794450 arab and african efforts must continue in order to stave off further escalation against sudan
1794451 my daughter is a very family girl she loves children and i know that she and michael have been hoping for this for a long time
1794452 on elvis side and on my side too i have twin brothers and then of course elvis had a twin brother who died at birth

1794456 i am very pleased with the operating results from the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we continue to improve results from quarter to quarter in a competitive environment this improvement reflects the marketing and sales effort to diversify and expand our markets and the operating improvements gained by our capital upgrade program
1794457 i expect the favorable demand trend for high performance alloys to largely continue in our significant end markets in addition our capital upgrade program will increase our production capacity allowing us to participate in the expected market growth particularly in the later part of fiscal 2009 as we previously stated we also expect a reduction in manufacturing costs and improvements in our working capital position
1794458 i urge the chinese government to release tibetan political prisoners account for tibetans who have quote disappeared since the protests in march and engage in meaningful dialogue and genuine autonomy for tibet
1794459 but it does no service to the chinese government and certainly no service to the people of china for the united states and other democracies to pretend that the suppression of rights in china does not concern us it does will and must concern us
1794460 the emergence of an economically vibrant more politically active china offers new opportunities for prosperity and cooperation
1794461 as president i intend to forge a more effective regional framework in asia that will promote stability prosperity and help us confront common transnational threats such as tracking down terrorists and responding to global health problems like avian flu
1794462 we need to watch with interest and perhaps increasingly with concern its military program
1794463 but we cant assume that that inevitably foreshadows military confrontation with china you could create a self fulfilling prophecy there which would be unnecessary and antithetical to our national security interests
1794464 i could hear a pro and a con emerging from that discussion
1794465 some arguing that it would enhance exalt the groups standing historically others arguing that it would be a disaster
1794466 they would have to come to a conclusion i believe where they would justify the use of a nuclear or some other weapon of mass destruction in what they would consider rational terms

1794475 we at sun are packaging staroffice so that enterprise customers will have popular and useful extensions at hand on the same cd whereas for openoffice the community has kept the download relatively lean and if you want more extensions and who doesnt you can download them from
1794476 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
1794477 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
1794478 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
1794479 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
1794480 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
1794481 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

1794505 pakistans biggest challenge is to reign in the isi as its involvement in incidents like the terrorist attack on the indian embassy in kabul are reasons enough for it to be reigned in
1794506 there has been political and military support to the taliban from outside over a long period now
1794507 though it is a month now since the kabul incident there has been no evidence connecting pakistan or the isi to the attack on the indian embassy

1794523 the notion of justice is infinitely superior to that of tradition

1794525 the recently announced policy of the government is an attempt to grab land from villagers on the pretext of industrialisation we wont let it happen villagers will not give even an inch of land to arcelormittal

1794528 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1794529 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1794530 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 per cent in 1994 to 38 per cent in 2002
1794531 there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having cost both the woman and the family
1794532 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1794533 i am innocent i have always stayed away from doping and that is why i was selected in the trials

1794553 we had no clue such a thing has happened i mean shooting is such a sport where you need to shut your mind from everything else and focus on the job at hand i guess thats why the news came late to us but this is really sad
1794554 individually its not going to make any impact on what i shoot but as part of the indian contingent i share the sense of shame i hope to remain indifferent
1794555 its a routine thing athletes undergo dope tests before any event its not about we as a country being shamed but the issue is that there is no question of protecting anyone who has erred
1794556 if you see the newspapers they say seven russian athletes have been withdrawn and many more such news items are there in print so the main thing is that we dont protect the guilty
1794557 the sports ministry had only said that there should be a fair selection trial for the athletes

1794573 the bosniak political elite are trying to present bosniaks muslims as the only victims of war which would provide them with the right to revenge and hate
1794574 it is very discouraging to see all the reactions on internet forums blogs etc where one can see how ethnic hatred is still boiling among former enemies

1794576 they lost in the presidential and parliamentary elections in february and may respectively the kosovo issue after short violent reactions in february is no longer at the top of peoples agenda they hope they might revive ultranationalist feelings of the past and regain popularity

1794596 is there any icon better known to americans than their own flag
1794597 this is something somebody should have caught along the way
1794598 this is something that probably should be corrected whether they do or not remains to be seen if they do correct it of course its an error stamp or a reissued stamp that would potentially make it a little more valuable
1794599 examined three times by the stamp advisory committee that i know of and then art directors look at it everybody looks at it
1794600 normally we would send the change back through our fact checking process in the case of this change we didnt do that so the mistake was not recognized it was brought to our attention after the stamps were issued
1794601 most security printers are very hawkeyed about keeping an eye out for that kind of thing routing it out and destroying it

1794604 the guy in front of me that was sugar ray leonard right
1794605 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him
1794606 i would have the tendency to believe they were telling the truth a little bit more
1794607 as a christian i wouldnt feel it would be my place to judge them
1794608 the faa does in all due respect an incredibly incomplete investigation
1794609 we just want the jury to hear the evidence and make a decision

1794614 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting

1794616 to be honest i cant even turn on sportscenter anymore
1794617 its just nonstop coverage of that it keeps changing and you cant keep up with it its getting frustrating and annoying as a fan trying to keep up with whats going on
1794618 sure hed consider somewhere else but it would have to be the right place i dont know for sure but i think the packers have called just about everybody tampa and the jets are the two teams out front
1794619 i got a lot of messages on my cell phone theres a lot of speculation out there i dont want to fuel any reports
1794620 im just going to be real careful saying anything right now because i dont have all the facts nor do you and maybe you have more than me

1794625 you cant make the world move slower or change where markets are headed
1794626 because were in a unique position in that we have a domestic design and production facility we were able to very quickly respond to the tsas request for information and ultimately be first to market with a true checkpoint tested product
1794627 weve responded so quickly were finding ourselves ahead of the curve in terms of airport preparedness for the new technology our case is available now nearly two weeks before airport training is complete but the tsa has expedited training in anticipation of travelers passing through with checkpoint friendly cases and our case has been fully tested live in several major airports
1794628 to say the stadium was not substantially complete is almost a joke
1794629 if 2 percent isnt complete then theyre going to stick you with it im not surprised
1794630 as it relates to the new ballpark we are in the process of closing out the project in addition to completing the punch list work we are working to resolve several issues inclusive of some contract related matters specific to the issue of substantial completion of the ballpark we are currently in discussions with the team and it is our hope that this will be resolved for the best interest of all parties

1794635 the 2008 wnba season promises to be one of the most competitive campaigns in league history and we are so pleased that mcdonalds has chosen to align with the wnba as the presenting sponsor of wnba tip off 2008

1794639 i still love writing my column and only re signed last year because i really did believe that we had hashed out all the behind the scenes expletive and come to some sort of agreement on creative lines media criticism rules the promotion of the column and everything else on espn com
1794640 within a few months all of those things changed and certain promises were not kept its as simple as that
1794641 espn does have its drawbacks the company has been turned down by some writers who felt a move to espn would amount to selling out and others have rejected espns advances out of fear the company would stifle their creativity
1794642 bill simmons who writes the popular sports guy column on espn
1794643 simmons agreed to write for a more national audience and to tone down some of his content particularly the criticism of television networks and announcers to appease espn but it wasnt easy
1794644 for the first five years it was a real creative battle and it was really frustrating for me at times simmons said

1794680 the world is not on course to meet universal access targets and in fact appears to be slipping away from existing commitments
1794681 our failure to meet those commitments will have an impact on millions of lives it is time for nations to live up to their commitments
1794682 there are 33 million people living with hiv in the world each day over 6 800 individuals worldwide are infected with hiv and more than 5 700 die from aids related illness
1794683 there are 4 5 lakh hiv people registered in the governments 176 art centres of these 1 59 lakh have low viral load that needs drug treatment the health of the rest is monitored closely and they get treated as soon as their viral load count falls
1794684 an hiv person has to take these medicines for life and the dosage has to be carefully monitored to ensure they dont develop resistance and need stronger drugs which are far more expensive and have serious side effects
1794685 we have 35 000 people registered of which 10 200 need treatment and are getting it
1794686 that was founded in 1989 to counteract fast food and fast life the disappearance of local food traditions and people s dwindling interest in the food they eat where it comes from how it tastes and how our food choices affect the rest of the world
1794687 suburban sprawl is like fast food cheap and easy but also unsatisfying and boring
1794688 takes its name from the slow food movement which arose as a reaction to the processed food industry
1794689 he provides ten steps to find the true slow home including go local go green go small and go simple
1794690 not just eager eco travel buffs snapping up the train charter trips but also a heretofore untapped group of travelers afraid to fly as well as recent retirees who are nostalgic for the longer train trips of their childhood
1794691 fifty years ago a flight to europe from new york meant a stop in gander reykjavik and shannon it was slow it was low but you got there in a day for domestic or european flying it seems completely obvious perhaps we dont need to stop flying we just have to slow down and enjoy the trip
1794692 slow design much like its gastronomic predecessor is all about pulling back on the reins and taking time to do things well do them responsibly and do them in a way that allows the designer the artisan and the end user to derive pleasure from it just like slow food its all about using local ingredients harvested and put together in a socially and environmentally responsible way above all it emphasizes thoughtful methodical slow creation and consumption of products as a way to combat the sometimes overwhelming pace of life in the bigger faster now 21st century
1794693 fast fashion involves a sort of democratization of style runway looks are reproduced as quickly as possible for consumers with target old navy and h amp m budgets designers like marc jacobs franchise second and third lines allowing the masses an opportunity to buy a bit of mystique the garments dont have to last since the styles are ephemeral this translates to resource intensive disposable clothing as with food theres little emphasis on who made a garment and how or the social and environmental effects the slow food movement has focused on making connections between the way a morsel is grown and how it tastes helping us reflect on how our consumer choices relate to human and eco impacts through transparency about origins at london fashion week designers at the estethica exhibit used similar language to describe design and production processes slow fashion means clothing and accessories that start with thoughtfully chosen beginnings are constructed by well paid individuals and are meant to remain wearable for years to come
1794694 perhaps like the slow food movement we need a slow car movement a radical lowering of the speed limit so that the private car can survive in an era of peak oil and global warming simply by being smaller and slower we dont need hydrogen cars and new technology we just need better smaller designs lower speed limits and no big suvs on the road to squish them
1794695 these days though most practitioners couldnt pronounce bressummer much less spell it these days youre lucky to get a decent spandrel out of your architect mostly its the dreaded cantilever at best at worst the joyless mud of autocad project management aluminium extrusion and precast boring panels
1794696 in urban switzerland more than every fourth household is kept by a single living man we studied these very interesting men and lifestyles to find out their needs and problems based on this research we developed seven products which each perfectly fits in the single mans lifestyle

1794698 the mist in the air that we see around the olympic green is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity we do have a communication problem here
1794699 its just the weather heavy humidity the governments made sure the citys not polluted for the games
1794700 once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1794701 the low visibility doesn t necessarily mean the air quality is bad
1794702 i would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
1794703 to put those numbers in some context the average us driver will use 580 gallons of fuel each year compared to 242 in the uk 139 percent more even allowing for fuel that s less than half the price 3 88 per gallon vs 8 52 per gallon currently us drivers are still poorer to the tune of nearly 200 a year

1794715 the chinese are clearly hyper focused and hyper worried about security and this is something theyve been working on for at least three or four years by now
1794716 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1794717 we think the olympics will proceed and they will proceed smoothly and well we think the chinese have got it covered as far as humanly possible
1794718 theres been a lot issues about this raised about how this technology will be used after the games and even during the games
1794719 i doubt that group has the wherewithal to make it to central beijing and to intervene in the olympics but it is a threat and there are many other threats
1794720 beijing as the host city will of course make full preparations for biological attacks like anthrax we have even made antibiotics and vaccines

1794726 be like a bush in the wastelands he will not see prosperity when it comes he will dwell in the parched places of the desert in a salt where no one lives
1794727 but blessed is the man who trusts in the lord whose confidence is in him he will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream it does not fear when heat comes its leaves are always green it has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit
1794728 it was time to come home he needed to be home for family situations
1794729 they have taught us many things about traveling abroad the faux pas of what not to do and what to do and specifically about beijing a couple of things to look out for
1794730 for one if you are at the dinner table tea is a huge thing in china and when youre pouring the tea and you put the pot down you are supposed to make sure not to point the spout at anyone in particular because its kind of a bad omen
1794731 another thing is the bows they are a good way to greet somebody
1794732 in the united states its a good idea to look somebody in the eye especially adults to show respect and that youre paying attention to them but in asian culture its frowned upon to look straight at an elders eyes so its better to look away or down when speaking to them
1794733 just remember that people over there arent going to speak the same language that you do or always feel the same that you do
1794734 before you even go research the food and the culture and the people and most importantly the history of china and the civilization
1794735 i mean its one of the richest civilizations in the history of mankind
1794736 so going into a foreign culture you already know what to expect so its not as much of a distraction when you get there you get to concentrate more on the competition and training

1794740 sen obama has been campaigning on an energy platform supposedly focused on providing relief to struggling american families but in reality his proposals would achieve the exact opposite
1794741 a closer look at his energy plan and at the nations history with similar measures shows what economists policy experts and most importantly hard working americans already know higher taxes mean higher prices
1794742 windfall profits taxes led to less domestic oil production in the 1980s while rebates would only boost demand for oil at a time when it is least available
1794743 economics 101 tells us that this is a formula that will worsen the price squeeze
1794744 the path to todays energy challenges is littered with failed alternative energy programs that benefited from billions in taxpayers subsidies
1794745 with gasoline almost 4 a gallon and food costs rising nationwide families can ill afford more misguided energy policy that echoes the failures of the jimmy carter era
1794746 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard
1794747 afterwards paul was absolutely mobbed with people who thought he should turn the story into a movie and i asked if i could play his mum
1794748 but i was the head coach so i made it a defensive timeout
1794749 i expect not to know what to expect and how its going to be like
1794750 you talk about the rookies and how theyre going to respond im interested in how im going to respond
1794751 i think every member of our program will be nervous because its important and everyone wants to do well
1794752 but at the same point you got to channel and direct their thinking based on how youre trying to strategize the game
1794753 no question thats the only way were going to win you got to buy in
1794754 if we want to be successful we all got to be in it together
1794755 you stand behind a coach especially a first year coach whatever he needs you to do you do it you might not necessarily think its the right thing but you do it because he has the team in mind you keep your mouth shut and go about your business but you might mumble here and there

1794768 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
1794769 contradict irans publicly stated policy of supporting the iraqi government and must cease
1794770 the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq in order to distract the attentions from the sources of u s failures in that country

1794776 as for the photo for the kid falling i shot that during a local bmx contest we hold in a ditch here in albuquerque nm every year its called the double ditch jam at the end of the day someone decided to have a long jump contest and this kid decided to try it so he took one jump before this and didnt go very far so the next jump he just sprinted at the ramp and it just launched him wrong probably the most surprising thing about this is that he walked away with only a few scrapes and bruises i can speak for most everyone there in that we pretty much all thought he was going to be seriously injured when we saw him let go of his bike that high
1794777 the current situation in south ossetia is uneasy and it needs measures to lower the confrontations
1794778 we urge all the parties to enter into a dialogue on this issue
1794779 we believe that it is important for them to come to a discussion to stop any acts of violence
1794780 i would be open to offshore drilling if we could ensure that the oil companies took every possible precaution to ensure a minimum of environmental damage
1794781 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1794782 they went after obama because he offered filling our tires as an alternative to drilling
1794783 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my sic country
1794784 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1794785 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get

1794787 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
1794788 these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
1794789 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
1794790 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
1794791 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship
1794792 abstinence only programs often only look at the negatives of sex not the positive this is especially important for young women who need to have control over having sex and having safe sex
1794793 with these programs you often hear sex just happens and adolescents are having less safe sex this detracts from adolescents having a choice and this leads to more dangerous sex with more sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies

1794796 personligen tror jag att om vi borde till gga att vi inte exkluderar en konstitutionell monarki under dess nuvarande dynasti det skulle ge substantiellt kade chanser till acceptans

1794799 det vore ett misstag att anta att japans de beseglades av atombomberna hennes nederlag var s kert innan den f rsta bomben f ll och orsakades av de verv ldigande marina styrkorna

1794802 the trouble is all those dollars overseas will become worthless if they cannot be used to purchase american assets
1794803 those corporations that the taxpayer is subsidizing in various ways are increasingly foreign held it makes even less sense to subsidize a belgian brewery than an american one
1794804 in our area over the past 20 years again clinton and bush 43 qwest farmed out 30 000 it jobs probably in this area over the same span some 100 000 it jobs were also farmed out to offshore concerns and nothing was done alaska airlines sent 430 jobs overseas two years ago and credit card companies everywhere are jumping on the outsourcing bandwagon in droves to the losses due to outsourcing is tremendous hence the sentiments concerning the recent defense department awarding a major defense contract to an american consortium tied to airbus
1794805 putting americans and american jobs above those of foreign interests
1794806 isnt the real issue that america has quit innovating and we are no longer leading the world in things with non military applications
1794807 youre totally missing that the pie grows with trade the real problem were facing is how to maintain the us standard of living while using fewer resources

1794811 we replaced them quickly but the costs associated with training and recruitment drives up the bottom line indian companies are adjusting to their hyper growth and they will find a balance or they will lose their edge thats how it works
1794812 to use the easiest example agriculture literally creates something from nothing
1794813 he was making adjustments and that s what the game is all about he didn t throw off speed until the second time around he threw all fastballs and one changeup the first time around the third time around he brought the slider out he knew what he was doing he didn t want us to see all his pitches he s kind of bright
1794814 he did a great job throwing strikes man from the first inning on he was pounding the strike zone he had great movement he reminds you a lot of kenny rogers he changed speeds big sinker and he fielded his position he was an athlete on the mound he knew what he was doing it s a perfect example of if you can throw strikes and keep the ball down you can have success in this league
1794815 i know you have to give credit to the guy but you also have to give credit to the guy behind the plate ramon hernandez he called a great game he knows those guys if ramon called the best pitch and he threw it the way he wanted i think he was going to be fine that s what this kid did whatever ramon called for the spot he hit the spot no problem
1794816 mark teixeira came down to first base and said he looks like a poor mans kenny rogers

1794827 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of
1794828 now its just about the packers and not about the situation its over now from what i understand its pretty much over

1794835 i urge the congress to act immediately to allow and encourage offshore drilling of oil and natural gas deposits off our coast
1794836 if we are able to and we will be able to identify large gas and oil deposits off our coast that will have a beneficial effect on the future price of oil

1794839 i like the fact hes going to continue the war in iraq
1794840 hes a man of action from what ive seen he doesnt take time talking about it
1794841 hard to say but per the last ad if michelle is indeed a man then that makes obama gay barack obama black gay man

1794843 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1795097 each year i get to celebrate independence day twice on june 30 i celebrate my independence day and on july 4 i celebrate america s this year is special because it marks the 40th anniversary of my independence on june 30 1968 i escaped communist cuba and a few months later i was in the us to stay that i happened to arrive in richmond on thanksgiving day is just part of the story but i digress ive thought a lot about the anniversary this year the election year rhetoric has made me think a lot about cuba and what transpired there in the late 1950s most cubans thought cuba needed a change and they were right so when a young leader came along every cuban was at least receptive when the young leader spoke eloquently and passionately and denounced the old system the press fell in love with him they never questioned who his friends were or what he really believed in when he said he would help the farmers and the poor and bring free medical care and ed ucation to all everyone followed when he said he would bring justice and equality to all everyone said praise the lord and when the young leader said i will be for change and ill bring you change everyone yelled viva fidel but nobody asked about the change so by the time the executioners guns went silent the peoples guns had been taken away by the time everyone was equal they were equally poor hungry and oppressed by the time everyone received their free education it was worth nothing by the time the press noticed it was too late because they were now working for him by the time the change was finally implemented cuba had been knocked down a couple of not ches to third world status by the time the change was over more than a million people had taken to boats rafts and inner tubes you can call those who made it ashore anywhere else in the world the most fortunate cubans and now im back to he beginning of my story luckily we would never fall in america for a young leader who promised change without asking what change how will you carry it out what will it cost america

1795120 i remember watching the olympics in 1968 on our black and white television seeing olga korbut compete and win and thinking that i wanted to be an olympian too
1795121 at the time i felt like i was making sacrifices
1795122 it was difficult to give those things up when you would see your friends doing things that you really wanted to do

1795124 but are interested in all facets of automotive excellence from racing to restoration
1795125 all of my accomplishments were a result of many many people who sacrificed gave me support and opportunities even when i didnt necessarily deserve them
1795126 but i was a fan of the olympics everything about them they were awe inspiring
1795127 my workouts were more intense than other rowers because i didnt have a lot of time

1796182 the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission
1796183 had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to sexual activities albeit unconventional carried on between consenting adults on private property
1796184 it is all there in the human rights act which took effect eight years ago but the max mosley ruling made the public interest case clear it made clear that even they the royals have a right to privacy
1796185 everyone is entitled to respect for his or private and family life home health and correspondence
1796186 what public interest is there in knowing whether the duke of edinburgh has prostate cancer
1796187 as head of state she is in a different league there would be a public interest but the law is now clear privacy about personal health also applies to members of the royal family public interest is not necessarily about what the public is interested in it should be about exposing crime or hypocrisy
1796188 this is a much wider issue than the health of prince philip
1796189 it is to establish clear boundaries through the pcc code and privacy law over what should be in the public domain

1796195 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
1796196 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
1796197 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1796198 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1796199 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1796200 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye

1796204 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
1796205 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1796206 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1796207 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1796208 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1796209 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision

1796224 sen obama as the leader of the democratic party should pick up the phone this morning and convince speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid that they should come here and recall the congress
1796225 should find five things they agree on energy and offer a joint bill and say lets pass it before the conventions if they walked in with five things theyd pass it before the conventions
1796226 hes now entrapped between the anti energy left led by former vice president al gore and pelosi and reid and the pro energy democrats who understand that theyre not going to survive if they are the party thats anti energy
1796227 as a former speaker i can sympathize with occasional moments when you make a mistake
1796228 republicans in large numbers voted against 13 democratic initiatives that would lower prices expand domestic supply and help consumers they must explain to their constituents why they continue to oppose these energy solutions while pushing a drill only plan that benefits big oil and not the american people
1796229 i believe there will come a point in early september when there will be an up or down vote in the house and i think the advice that her pelosi advisers were giving out to democrats back home is in the end very very bad advice
1796230 my prediction is that by september the democrats will split into a pro energy faction and an anti energy faction and that the republicans and the pro energy democrats will be an absolute majority on the house floor and that they will pass something
1796231 weve already seen sen obama begin to move a little closer towards maybe possible some day eventually if necessary being in favor of more energy
1796232 in the face of mccain hes made a clear decisive change
1796233 what i want to know from the democrats is are they really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1796234 we demand that the speaker bring congress back to washington to have an up or down vote on a pro american pro production energy package this will make us less dependent on the sheikhs and venezuelan president hugo chavez

1796240 which is facing increasing development pressure and more and more inappropriate development such as the 45 story trump soho condo hotel we cannot stress strongly enough how much we would prefer to see this building re used rather than to have it simply sold off to the highest bidder

1796273 fear and loathing on the campaign trail 72 by hunter s
1796274 here is a man who grew up in a broken home whose father left at a young age and who was raised by a single mother
1796275 its an admirable story of rising from rags to riches one that resonates in many ways hes a modern horatio alger
1796276 now the mccain campaign wants to create a dramatically different narrative
1796277 they want you to see him as a man who went to fancy schools who has had the beneficiary of an elite life and is increasingly removed from the mainstream of normal american life
1796278 and now the mccain campaign wants to turn obamas strength into a weakness and make him seem like a celebrity who has nothing to offer but high blown words
1796279 hes obviously not in the same league as britney spears or paris hilton theyve gone way too far with that but weve seen where strategies that have been derided by commentators have been effective with voters
1796280 but hes not an elitist thats not a sustained campaign tactic here was someone who grew up with nothing versus the son of four star admirals its a nice try and a good diversion in the first part of august but painting him as an elitist is not a winning strategy going into the fall

1796289 some 76 patriarchs have led the maronite christian community over the years

1796291 the judges had a strong prosecution case and condemned the party
1796292 when it came to sentencing they chose the lightest one just a fine they were afraid of the consequences of closing down a ruling party it would create a leadership vacuum sink the economy and also risk turkeys accession talks to the european union
1796293 today the court did not reach the required number of votes for a party closure but this decision is a warning to the party
1796294 then they will run the county in their own way

1796301 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
1796302 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
1796303 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
1796304 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada
1796305 this is an important finding since there are effective medications to reduce gastric acid that can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding

1796323 sprint is required to vacate the spectrum as part of a larger fcc plan to swap spectrum with public safety agencies in the 800 megahertz band a move aimed at minimizing interference between wireless service and public safety users
1796324 if there are merits and fcc grants additional waivers then criteria 1 would fail
1796325 if fcc sees the sprints petition does not hold the merit for additional waivers then they would make a judgment on sprint and possibly impose fines then criteria 1 would pass
1796326 this is a prediction that sprint will fail to meet the july 26 deadline for vacating the 800mhz spectrum

1796331 at a time when many people are watching the pennies its not surprising that the public have become tired of news about rock stars being odd and pampered celebrities holidaying in exotic locations the fact that amy winehouse is seen as six times more boring than the economy this summer illustrates this perfectly

1796333 the athletes are here and dreaming of the olympic games
1796334 we would love to see the clarification so the young players of the world can participate in the tournament to let the best athletes come to the games in future
1796335 theoretically the clubs could ask their players to go back to europe because they would be entitled to do so
1796336 and if the players do not come back there could be a case of a breach of contract
1796337 this could affect the tournament and its in the interest of nobody to destroy what could be an extraordinary tournament this year
1796338 surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1796339 the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future

1796359 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and then not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when youre seeking your parties nomination
1796360 john mccain is not a bad man but he is badly mistaken when he has embraced the bush and cheney economic policies and he is badly mistaken when he has embraced their energy policies someone was telling me this morning that his solution to the american energy challenge was to drill drill drill well it sounded a lot like my dentist to me
1796361 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book further today i talked with john maguire who has given me the permission to state the following on his behalf i never receive any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1796362 sen mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists
1796363 the candidates are responding to the fact that the public is hurting and crying for relief
1796364 i dont do things i would normally do right now
1796365 politically i think its the only domestic economically leaning issue where the republicans have a slight opportunity even advantage because of the trend in support for even greater exploration
1796366 i would have to lean more toward mccain with this offshore drilling
1796367 human powered search provider chacha has cut the standard pay rate of its online guides and shifted to a performance based compensation system
1796368 if chacha wasnt a company for profit and if chacha was just another social network what ceo brad bostic said may be true but to the contrary we guides are independent contractors and as independent contractors we are in a large part in it for the money
1796369 i for one will no longer continue as a guide and i fear many others will join me 10 per question answered is a joke
1796370 this desperate move just proves the flawed business model chacha is using bostic says chacha is getting tens of millions of questions each month as a guide i know half of them are teenage boys asking about sex and teenage girls asking whether little billy likes little mary
1796371 personally i think this program is a great idea and its whats best for the company there are so many guides who care only about making that 20 per question that they dont take the time to give correct answers this will put a stop to that and our customers will get the service that they deserve
1796372 how they raise premiums deny claims and refuse insurance to those who need it most
1796373 while allstate publicly touts its good hands approach it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a boxing gloves strategy against its policyholders
1796374 a tempest rages among insurers and regulators over climate risks
1796375 coerce what is believed to be the worlds largest industry into advancing the notion of human induced climate change
1796376 this is not one risk among many but really the pre eminent risk facing the industry
1796377 essentially a call to action that seeks to enlist insurers in a campaign to promote an agenda informed not by science or evidence but by the policy predilections of a handful of interests groups
1796378 this was a difficult extraction of the boy from the ravine due to the terrain
1796379 our coastguard rescue teams and the rescue helicopter crews are used to working closely together in such circumstances to endeavour to achieve the best possible outcome
1796380 analog to digital conversion hdmi output and sound encoding decoding
1796381 to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt fair and equitable settlement of a claim with respect to which the insurers liability has become reasonably clear
1796382 actual awareness of the falsity unfairness or deceptiveness of the act
1796383 any party that is liable for the conduct of the named insured is also covered as an insured
1796384 a gency is the consensual relationship between two parties when one the agent acts on behalf of the other the principal and is subject to the principals control
1796385 it is the principals extent of control over the details of accomplishing the assigned task that primarily distinguishes the status of independent contractor from that of agent
1796386 you know i hope that i and all americans can be colorblind about any president
1796387 makes tough decisions he takes charge hes ready to sacrifice his interest on behalf of the interest of the country
1796388 im not home a lot so michelle is usually willing to give it up
1796389 the only time i grab for the remote is when a game is on
1796390 sometimes i win the arm wrestling contest but foolishly she continues to try to assert her control over the remote
1796391 this is a battle that will continue for a long time
1796392 but they can still hang with spongebob squarepants and i have to say spongebob is pretty funny
1796393 oh yeah your wife will be on one of those bikes soon you gonna run me over too
1796394 yep look a cyclist thump that used to be my wife but now its a speed bump
1796395 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
1796396 all i ever needed to know i learned in kindergarten
1796397 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will break my heart
1796398 remember the compliments you receive forget the insults if you succeed in doing this tell me how
1796399 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
1796400 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
1796401 the more you tighten your grip the more star systems will slip through your fingers
1796402 theres nothing better than a great romance to ruin a perfectly good friendship
1796403 these moments as beautiful as they are are evil when theyre gone
1796404 i have been in and out of new orleans numerous times since katrina on some long term stories
1796405 homestar ruiner is a great series premiere and kick off for the season the next five months will be filled with lots of surprises
1796406 this is how we always envisioned episodic gaming monthly releases straight into the living room were happy to be working with the chapmans and nintendo to make it a reality
1796407 our last game topped out at 8 bits weve heard this one might reach 9 or 10
1796408 elitepremium rounds out the most exciting range of satellite internet access plans ever offered
1796409 over the last few weeks we have enhanced the speeds across our full range of service plans we are the only provider that offers consumers in underserved parts of the country such a comprehensive range of true broadband service options
1796410 this goes to show you how dangerous this is and safety vests do work
1796411 this was a very fortunate incident in which the swat officer was not wounded
1796412 we were studying little graphene trampolines and by complete accident we made a graphene sheet over a hole then we started studying it and saw that it was trapping gas inside
1796413 its amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier you can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other and with a wall only one atom thick nothing would go through it
1796414 you could have instruments on one side of the membrane in vacuum or air and on the other side you would have dna or proteins suspended in liquid
1796415 and then you could get right up close to image the molecules within a few angstroms
1796416 once you have a membrane that wont let anything past the most interesting thing is to then poke a hole in it then you can detect what leaks through that hole with high sensitivity or make sure only what you want leaks through that hole
1796417 we need to build a better base thats more impenetrable such as single crystal silicon im confident we can make a leakproof version
1796418 it looks like moderate drinking has been increasing heavy drinking is down a little bit and total alcohol consumption is down a little bit
1796419 it is encouraging news that more people are drinking moderately and the average intake is coming down rather than shooting up
1796420 it generally tends to reflect trends within the country among middle class white americans
1796421 people drank about a third more back in the 50s and 60s than they did in the 70s up to 2004
1796422 at the same time theres been a decrease in beer and an increase in wine consumption among people but the average intake has decreased
1796423 the data are very clear that light to moderate drinking without binge drinking is generally good for health whereas a larger amount of binge drinking is bad it looks like in this population its going in the right direction
1796424 recent decades the messages about alcohol have increasingly emphasized the potential to derive both pleasure and health benefits from wine provided the dose is prudent the trends in this study suggest those messages are having an impact at least in framingham massachusetts among those not vulnerable to alcohol abuse intake patterns appear to be shifting in accord with expert recommendations
1796425 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1796426 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1796427 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1796428 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1796429 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1796430 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

1796433 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1796434 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1796435 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1796436 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1796437 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1796438 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1796439 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1796440 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1796441 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1796442 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1796443 the one and only substitute for experience which we have not ourselves had is art literature
1796444 it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
1796445 for us in russia communism is a dead dog for many people in the west it is still a living lion

1796449 she dumped craig you know him white power tats grommet earrings

1796459 of course what kind of question is that who isnt
1796460 bono the rock star and campaigner against third world debt is asking the irish government to contribute more to africa at the same time hes reducing tax payments that could help fund that aid
1796461 im sorry did the new york times just put on the front page that iraq had a nuclear weapons program and was plotting to build an atomic bomb
1796462 it surely must have been a rovian plot to somehow get the times to admit that iraq has a nuclear weapons program on the verge of an atomic bomb by as early as 2003 and right before an election where the iraq war is listed as the top election concern among likely voters
1796463 seems that the new york times owes judith miller an apology or at least a hat tip
1796464 i would likewise defend someone who came to a party as a klansman same theory klansmen are scary halloween is about scary costumes halloween is not about endorsing the characters youre dressing as
1796465 it is surpassingly strange to watch an industry will its own destruction
1796466 due to the nations need for energy and dependable shipping lanes we are losing a football fields worth of wetlands every 45 minutes to erosion this unrivaled land loss threatens the nations fishing our energy our ports and most importantly leaves new orleans increasingly vulnerable to storms such as katrina
1796467 we are asking that the future president of the united states direct the resources and attention necessary to restore coastal louisiana and secure the future of louisianas communities
1796468 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans
1796469 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
1796470 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
1796471 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
1796472 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
1796473 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it
1796474 the obama democrats have launched a massive 50 state registration drive

1796482 hearsay evidence is also admissible in these kangaroo courts as well as coerced testimony and secret evidence
1796483 in no other court in this country would the evidence be admissible
1796484 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests

1796488 a two per cent increase is ludicrous as any government accountant must be well aware
1796489 it is inconceivable that inflation on defence costs will come in under two per cent over the next decade
1796490 a two per cent increase over and above inflation would at least be an honest gesture but even that wont come close to meeting the nato target
1796491 the canadian forces senior leadership gives the impression that it is happy with the level of funding that has been announced has their experience driven their expectations so low that they no longer want to face the consequences of pushing for robust capable effective and expanded canadian forces that canadas interests demand
1796492 we have men and women in harms way and the government is trying to do this on the cheap if thats how they feel they shouldnt put our kids in harms way they should simply stay at home
1796493 the chinese governments decision to bar olympic gold medalist joey cheek from attending the olympics because of his advocacy for darfur is reprehensible
1796494 this action by beijings leaders is part of an orchestrated campaign to deny entry to individuals because of their political views beliefs writings association religion and ethnicity
1796495 because of their beliefs advocacy for the people of darfur and human rights in china and tibet
1796496 it is essential that president bush show leadership in promoting democracy freedom and human rights during his visit to china
1796497 his brand of cricket is going to have to change with the style of play that he wants the team to play
1796498 you can do those things until you bump your head and the pressures on and you need to win series and win tests
1796499 knowing the man like i think we do hes going to be trying to prove to everybody that he can
1796500 but for him its going to be about finding the balance where he can marry the two of his captaincy and batting
1796501 i think theres certainly a lot more responsibility in terms of having to walk the walk with your team
1796502 you are always asking a lot of your players demanding a lot from their performances and thinking and you have to do that yourself that will come in time
1796503 its in time when you need to sustain your success
1796504 he has some tough challenges ahead hes got to develop a team pretty quickly and decide on what his style of play will be
1796505 in light of our cash flow improvements i respectfully urge the governor to reconsider his executive order
1796506 costly litigation is something we should avoid because those are precious resources that should be spent on education welfare and other services californians expect and deserve
1796507 theres no federal labor provision that requires they receive any minimum payment
1796508 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1796509 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1796510 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1796511 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1796512 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1796513 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1796514 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1796515 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1796516 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1796517 im just going to do everything im supposed to do whether its off the field or on the field and get past this
1796518 one thing about our organization and team is i can come out here and not have the weight of the world on my shoulders
1796519 like i said i gave that weight for someone else to carry
1796520 i thought he had a chance to compete to be a starting running back one of the most gifted running backs that ive been around for a long time very similar to terrell davis when he came in
1796521 really talented i mean hes a big guy hes got good moves he sees the field well picked up the offense quickly was protecting well
1796522 i think hes still going to be a good back i havent heard what the prognosis is or how long hes going to be out but hell definitely help this team in the future im sure

1796545 just going into a cd store when i was 13 seeing the clearance section and trying something out you know trying out old metallica or megadeth or even biohazard back then was kinda scary for a lot of kids so it was cool to listen to i remember kids were walking around with those guns n roses charles manson shirts seeing that image being thrown out there it was kind of neat and it made me curious as to what it was
1796546 his saves are legit unlike many closers he actually pitches in close games in large part because the angels cant score runs they currently rank eighth in the al fifteen of his saves have come in one run games and only 8 occurred in games the angels have won by more than two runs hes also durable 17 times hes saved games on back to back days which is the exact kind of thing that allows a team to go on a run and separate from the pack
1796547 if the organization of the olympics were a sport we should give china the gold medal
1796548 the president understands the reasons that are leading the dalai lama given the current circumstances to not request a meeting during his stay in france in august
1796549 its not for china to fix my agenda or to dictate my meetings
1796550 the hawkish rancor of ecb president jean claude trichet is likely going to be toned down considerably
1796551 the ecb and bank of england dont have much to cheer about

1796560 the candidates are responding to the fact that the public is hurting and crying for relief
1796561 i dont do things i would normally do right now
1796562 politically i think its the only domestic economically leaning issue where the republicans have a slight opportunity even advantage because of the trend in support for even greater exploration
1796563 i would have to lean more toward mccain with this offshore drilling
1796564 somehow though the effect this calamity is having on chinas rise doesnt quite register in the west
1796565 given the responsiveness of food demand to income growth chinas rapid growth of 9 10 percent per year suggests that its demand for food is growing faster than its production capacity how is it that chinas surging income growth has not pushed its demand for food beyond its domestic production capacity
1796566 food consumption and income growth patterns may explain how china has been able to remain self sufficient in most food items
1796567 still at income levels where they demand increased quantities of many foods as their income rises
1796568 while china has emerged as the worlds leading importer of soybeans vegetable oil cotton wool rubber and animal hides it has been surprisingly successful at meeting the basic food needs of its population of more than 1 3 billion people and it has stepped up as a major food exporter
1796569 and a new 199 price point in line with the iphone
1796570 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
1796571 to compare the long running imac g5 design lasted three years
1796572 are just the beginning of apples exploration of multi touch on the mac
1796573 currently these gestures require the same touch sensing technology used in the iphone but they use a traditional looking trackpad
1796574 eventually we expect apple to change the trackpad to backlit color screens for a more dynamic user interface on the mac
1796575 not until the technology has fully matured over the next 2 3 years
1796576 when the people who are the future of the organization are leaving thats a sign that company isnt doing well
1796577 it doesnt mean you should run out the door it means you should examine other elements
1796578 theres a difference between a bad quarter and a troubling trend
1796579 when you hear disappointing news about your company get the official and credible explanation of whats happening
1796580 if you dont have confidence in leadership doing well you shouldnt follow it
1796581 downturns can be the most compelling periods for career development
1796582 it doesnt look good right now try back in a few months
1796583 we go home everyday knowing were making a positive difference
1796584 weve got about 20 people on our waiting list and its growing every week
1796585 it was hard to attract talent since people in the construction industry were so well employed now we can get the really experienced construction workers because of the downturn in real estate
1796586 you do the best you can and its not always pretty
1796587 a lot of times you interview folks over and over again and you know theyre lying and youve got to figure out why its a tough business here you have a bunch of people dead and several diminished and youre charged with solving the crime you try not to step on peoples toes but sometimes it happens
1796588 there has not been a single prosecution of a woman for making a false claim
1796589 this is an extremely worrying trend and one where proper action should be taken if some csa claimants are getting away with making false applications it will not only slow things down for other families but it also sends the wrong message about the things were willing to accept
1796590 we have worked hard to maintain dialogue with the organisers of the camp since they announced their intention to stage the event and well keep talking
1796591 the community residents of the camp have told us how they would like us to police them
1796592 we are considering their views and we will respond accordingly to move relationships forward
1796593 i would hope that we can continue to work with the organisers to police the site in a way that satisfies both ourselves and the people attending
1796594 our message remains very clear we will police the event proportionately so that the people attending it can protest lawfully
1796595 we know the vast majority of those on the site are responsible and law abiding and we want to be able to provide a service to them
1796596 they did not express an interest to come on the site for the first 24 hours and then they came on the site with violence seizing essential health and safety items

1796710 describing the natural history of gi bleeding after ischemic stroke has important implications for management of patients with stroke
1796711 because the temporal relationship between bleeding and major vascular events during hospitalization is uncertain in our study valid inferences are difficult
1796712 these findings suggest a strong association between gi hemorrhage and poor clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke

1796766 here we are all of a sudden in the 60th year after strom thurmond bolting the democratic party over a simple thing something almost unheard of because he did not want the armed forces to be integrated
1796767 here we are 45 years after the i have a dream speech forty years after the assassinations of kennedy and king and this party that i have been a part of for so long this party that has been accused of taking black people for granted is about to deliver the nomination for the nations highest office to an african american how do you describe that all those days in jail cells wondering if anything you were doing was even going to have an impact
1796768 but ive got a head too and in the beginning my head was with clinton the conventional wisdom was that this thing was going to be over in february
1796769 youd be real embarrassed if he won and you wasnt down with it
1796770 conversations like those i had with clyburn and lewis however begin to illuminate just how emotionally complicated such internal deliberations were
1796771 if anybody tells you they expected this result theyre not being honest with you
1796772 of course i would support someone i knew and had liked and had worked with versus someone id never heard of
1796773 every kid is always talking about what his parents have been through
1796774 and no kid has any clue what hes talking about
1796775 but now i realize had i been given the opportunity what i could have been and im about to die
1796776 the people i work with are the new black politics we dont carry around that history we see the world through post civil rights eyes i dont mean that disrespectfully but thats just the way it is
1796777 i dont want in any way to seem critical of the generation of leadership who fought so i could be sitting here
1796778 barack obama is the sum of their struggle hes the sum of their tears their fights their marching their pain this opportunity is the sum of that
1796779 but its like watching something that youve been working on all your life sort of come together right before your eyes and you cant see it
1796780 its like youve been building the great wall of china and you finally put that last stone in and you cant see it you just cant see the enormity of it
1796781 he should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself
1796782 but youve got to learn one basic lesson youre trying to start at the top and you cant start at the top in politics
1796783 i dont think a group with 435 members can be the top of anything
1796784 race was a factor in the contest between obama and clinton
1796785 theres no question race will be a factor with obama and mccain but im not sure it plays out as neatly as people think theres no question that some young cohort of white voters were drawn to obama because they like the idea of a break with the past a young white politician from illinois might not have gotten that support so race probably cost obama some votes and it probably won him some votes thats the complex reality were living in
1796786 you know what its like growing up every single day and having people ask to touch your hair because theyve never seen hair like that
1796787 to have the entire class laugh and giggle when somebody pronounces niger as nigger the constant bombardment of that kind of thing really affects your spirit and its every single day like when people want to come back from a vacation and compare their tan to yours and joke about being black
1796788 i dont want people to expect me to speak about those issues
1796789 i want people to ask me about nonproliferation i want them to run to me to speak about the situation in the middle east
1796790 i dont want to be the person thats turned to when cnn talks about black leaders
1796791 so obamas the first one out there on the ice
1796792 this campaign is giving other african americans like myself the courage to be themselves
1796793 there was an arrogance and a complete dismissiveness in our campaign against obama that he was a lightweight that he couldnt get black support
1796794 a lot of the black leaders didnt know him didnt think he was black enough didnt think he was of the civil rights movement
1796795 internal polling in both campaigns after iowa showed obama suddenly garnering closer to 75 or 80 percent of the black vote in primary states
1796796 i grew up in the south where men like barack obama who right now is older than bill clinton was when he ran for president were called boy
1796797 there was something about the condescension on his face when he said it and the dismissiveness in his voice
1796798 the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and bitterness of those years at times that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politicians own failings
1796799 in the context of what i do for a living ive not figured out a black or white way to fill a pothole
1796800 i think there was a lot of sensitivity some warranted and some unwarranted
1796801 its based on your life experience and its generational you know if you have a sore on your arm you dont necessarily have to touch the sore to feel the pain you can touch another part of your arm youve still got a certain sensitivity to it so if race is the sensitive thing then anything that even gets close to it sounds like it looks like it feels like it is it
1796802 you guys told me it was a skin condition i thought i was talking to a brother
1796803 look i never asked anybody to be for me because i was black
1796804 i asked people to be for me because i thought i was the best candidate when i ran for city council and when i ran for mayor im proud of the votes i received im proud i received the votes of the majority of the african american community and the majority of the vote from the white community but i never asked anybody to give me anything because i was black i asked people to give me a chance because i thought i was the best
1796805 its presumptuous it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep in contrast to any other group i mean i dont remember seeing john kerry on tv and anybody saying to him i cant believe youre not for hillary clinton why
1796806 the challenge there is never forgetting where you came from
1796807 so yes i am mayor of all philadelphia but i am quite well aware of and raise on a regular basis the fact that the majority of people who are killed in philadelphia are african american that the overwhelming majority of people who have health care challenges are african american that education has tremendous disparity gaps unemployment incarceration poverty homelessness housing all affect the african american community at a disproportionate level as opposed to everyone else
1796808 this isnt a struggle that began in the 1930s or 1960s its a struggle that began in 1620 its a struggle against slavery and its children
1796809 one of the things i talk to clients about is that the digital divide has changed
1796810 its no longer along racial lines like it was in 1996 and 2000 now its more economic and educational
1796811 things are changing from where they were 30 years ago the fights are changing and you have an infrastructure thats not producing results look at the incarceration rates the difference between whites and blacks what are the old organizations accomplishing
1796812 there are some members who need to go or to update and be accountable
1796813 its not about getting rid of the n a a c p or our members of congress its just wanting to be proud of our leaders
1796814 shes poised to be one of the most influential people in politics and particularly among african americans in politics
1796815 even as we continue to defend affirmative action as a useful if limited tool to expand opportunity to underrepresented minorities we should consider spending a lot more of our political capital convincing america to make investments needed to ensure that all children perform at grade level and graduate from high school a goal that if met would do more than affirmative action to help those black and latino children who need it the most
1796816 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized
1796817 and i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence
1796818 its a very interesting question but as a black person you should feel confident that he will focus on your injustices and know that all the other injustices in other communities affect you too
1796819 there have been wounds in all the communities not just in the black community there are plenty of wounds to go around
1796820 youre constantly tested by a whole host of factors to see whether youre speaking for the entire commonwealth or just for one community
1796821 i dont fit in any box and i think thats what the electorate has had to learn about me
1796822 yes but its not good enough for me to have the reaction that you just did to say im the governor not the mayor

1796835 and he admitted that the dept could have looked at this closer i think he agreed with us that this all could have been avoided if they would have talked to us prior to the notice or rule making
1796836 were now sitting down with in a negotiated rule making process to make sure things are done correctly
1796837 he bucks has some concerns over enforceability of the current law
1796838 he was adamant that the mta wasnt behind the rule change
1796839 they dor officials were overwhelmed and surprised by the amount of interest
1796840 we have had no communication with the tavern industry on this manner
1796841 your article was completely wrong about the reasons for the department pursuing this rule change it had nothing to do with economic competition between members of the liquor industry
1796842 msba members strive to uphold both montana and federal law governing the operation of our breweries
1796843 it is imperative that all montana breweries do as well
1796844 that was the problem that the rule proposed to address
1796845 that doesnt mean it is what the rule would be
1796846 the proposed rule did not necessarily address the underlying problem which is assure responsible consumption on premises for public health and safety reasons
1796847 weve seen a level of volatility in september that we havent seen before
1796848 we have no visibility beyond september on the advertising market
1796849 any long term forecast for the tv advertising market must be tentative we would like to emphasize that our profit target depends on trading conditions which are more than usually uncertain
1796850 in particular traditional forms of advertising will suffer as tv audiences fragment
1796851 as we continue to reshape time warner well increasingly focus on our goal to create and manage high quality branded content
1796852 a separation of aol would eliminate whats been a drag on growth and a management distraction
1796853 we look forward to hearing more about structural alternatives there
1796854 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals

1796856 dvb h will be published by the commission in the list of official eu standards
1796857 as a result all eu member states will have to support and encourage the use of dvb h for the launch of mobile tv services thus avoiding market fragmentation and allowing economies of scale and accordingly affordable services and devices

1796864 the special courts set up by sudan to try alleged rebels who attacked khartoum are a charade
1796865 the special courts dont meet even minimal fair trial standards and yet they have the power to sentence people to death

1796869 any prediction like this is just a guess but im hoping well have a synthetic cell in under 10 years
1796870 creating artificial life is very different from reproducing what existed already in nature
1796871 that artificial life may be possible in the future but this future may be hundreds of years away
1796872 weve made good progress on the cell membrane leaving the genetic material as the major challenge
1796873 it will be synthetic life it will depend on existing parts
1796874 self reproducing and capable of evolution self containing thereby possessing individual identity self sustaining in that they can maintain their complex structure
1796875 when we learned about your tv campaigns and your support from europe we knew you were not just one of the many whites that come to visit us with their cameras
1796876 i believe that education is the most precious gift that we can offer to the youth
1796877 i know that many of you walk eight kilometres a day to go to and from school and that you share one book among four or six pupils
1796878 a piece of my heart stays with you but i return with my batteries recharged and with the conviction that investing in education is preparing the next generation to contribute to peacebuilding

1796885 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
1796886 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
1796887 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1796888 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1796889 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
1796890 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
1796891 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
1796892 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
1796893 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
1796894 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time
1796895 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1796896 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
1796897 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
1796898 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1796899 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1796900 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1796901 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye

1796913 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1796914 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues

1796918 when i woke up i was in the middle of a row of bodies waiting for postmortem
1796919 towering over me the doctors and nursing staff looked dazed they must have been surprised to see a dead man come alive like that but when was i dead
1796920 people were dumped quite haphazardly into trucks without following any procedure or checking if they were alive
1796921 no medical examinations were held and anybody found unconscious was assumed dead

1796924 there are some tourist areas that are four to five kilometers miles away from the fire but we dont think they are in danger
1796925 the starting point of the fire was just near a stream which tourists use for rafting
1796926 this is one of the biggest fires in antalyas history in terms of area affected but definitely the biggest area in terms of damage it has caused
1796927 it could affect an area of 4 000 hectares we cannot clearly define the area destroyed because of heavy smoke
1796928 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1796929 oh sorry we destroyed your city and killed all those people in such a gruesome way when we really didnt have to hey could you pass me that stapler
1796930 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1796931 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1796932 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1796933 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
1796934 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
1796935 how else clean i personally know that a bottom is occurring or has occurred
1796936 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1796937 i lost my son and my daughter is now handicapped because of the mines near our farm
1796938 we never know were to step and had called many times for the government to clean the area but in vain had i to lose a child to bring some attention to our area
1796939 the mines are everywhere every year we hear that they are going to take it away but it never happens
1796940 we just get promises and while it doesnt happen we keep losing our children as result of an unfair war that never ends
1796941 all attention has been switched to the security situation of the country leaving the mines clearance behind although it has the same importance
1796942 millions of funds have been allocated to security concern while mines clearance are receiving little attention
1796943 residents of rural areas are more vulnerable to the danger of landmines especially for being mostly illiterate people
1796944 they dont accept losing part of their lands to the mines and sometimes insist on farming cultivating and raising their cattle in these areas becoming an easy target
1796945 some people depend on these areas to survive and although we try to make them aware of the situation they want to support their families and just choose to ignore the danger
1796946 i lost my wife and daughter because of the landmines but i dont have choice and have to keep working in the land
1796947 i have two choices the first is taking the risk and feed my family with my income and the other is to die from hungry i prefer the first option because at least i will know that im trying to survive and god will help me for this reason
1796948 i miss playing with my friends and going to school

1796950 the official position that waterboarding is not torture or our official position that its a thrill ride
1796951 its just something theyre trying to make a quick buck off i guess
1796952 i think its educational because everyone hears about waterboarding but no one really knows what it is
1796953 i feel more strongly about that yes having seen this
1796954 when they have the sideshow you see real people thats legit but this here uh uh
1796955 because it gives us a chance to be political and silly at the same time
1796956 robot waterboarding became a way of exploring the issue without doing any harm
1796957 the group who most stands to benefit from the knowledge
1796958 our hope is that it forces a consideration of an issue that people may not be thinking about but they should be thinking about
1796959 adults find it very shocking and kids are like that stinks theyre so desensitized they have no idea what the ethical issues are they wish there was water spraying in their face
1796960 waterboarding sweetie is a kind of torture where they pour water on peoples faces so they feel like theyre drowning but then there was a big controversy because a lot of americans are saying you shouldnt torture people even if they are terrorists
1796961 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1796962 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1796963 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1796964 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1796965 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1796966 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1796967 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1796968 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1796969 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1796970 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1796971 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1796972 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1796973 the regulators should investigate themselves for bailing out fannie mae and freddie mac the creditors of bear stearns and the financial system with new lending facilities they have swapped u s treasury bonds for toxic securities
1796974 in each one of these episodes the government bailed out the shareholders the bondholders and to some degree management
1796975 of three dozen or so medium sized regional banks a good third are in distress

1796977 its needed for the preservation of the language and to bring the language into the space of a living language again because as the elders pass on the knowledge and understanding are passing with them

1796979 we will not tolerate this in chicago we want to know where its coming from and who is filing these reports
1796980 chicago will fire police officers that report illegal immigrants to ice

1796984 vans belonging to this corporation are currently travelling around ireland and indeed around the world photographing everything they pass
1796985 i like guys who are extremely good looking and treat me badly
1796986 must be nice im attracted to men who are ugly and treat me badly
1796987 we dont know what happened to them but they came back crying

1796989 el cartel est inspirado en una fotograf a de mi nica hija y representa a una mujer flamenca algo muy tradicional y t pico de estas fiestas la presencia en el cartel de un jarr n como los que hay desde hace a os en la plaza de espa a responde a la b squeda de algo significativo de nuestra localidad m s all de lo que habitualmente suele tener protagonismo en este tipo de pinturas
1796990 la decisi n de elegirlo ganador de entre los tres carteles presentados fue un nime ha sido el que mayor impacto nos ha creado
1796991 es un gran honor presentar a los campilleros y campilleras el cartel y la programaci n de nuestra feria y quiero aprovechar para agradecer la colaboraci n y el respaldo obtenido de parte de la junta de festejos de todas las asociaciones de campillos de las hermandades y cofrad as y de todos nuestros vecinos y vecinas as como la presencia en este acto de representantes de los grupos pol ticos izquierda unida y partido popular hacer la feria no es f cil y menos a n teniendo en cuenta la desaceleraci n econ mica que estamos viviendo la situaci n del ayuntamiento no es lo boyante que quisi ramos pero desde el primer momento hemos buscado al contratar y definir los eventos y actuaciones agradar a los campilleros y campilleras de todas las edades el programa se ha hecho con mucho cari o esmero y dedicaci n y es bastante variado con actuaciones y actividades que puedan cubrir la demanda de nuestros j venes y mayores deseo a todos los campilleros y campilleras que disfruten junto a los suyos estas fiestas porque la feria es para vivirla para compartir experiencias agradables guardarlas para siempre y compartir luego esos magn ficos recuerdos con nuestros sucesores
1796992 y hemos previsto desde un principio no excedernos de dicho presupuesto
1796993 un importante n mero de visitas durante la feria y aumente considerablemente su poblaci n habitual durante estos d as
1796994 el ayuntamiento siempre ha puesto a trabajar importantes equipos de limpieza y este a o vamos a luchar nuevamente porque a primera hora de cada d a tanto el real de la feria como el resto de lugares donde se realizan actividades est n perfectamente limpios en este sentido tambi n solicitamos la concienciaci n de los ciudadanos entre todos debemos procurar ensuciar menos
1796995 eso s el ayuntamiento exigir que se tomen las medidas necesarias en cuanto a la seguridad y la existencia del seguro de responsabilidad civil
1796996 vende mucho m s que un alcalde sea acusado de una forma tan vil y terrible
1796997 a partir de ahora se podr llamar a declarar a testigos hacer un reconocimiento psicol gico a ella aportar las pruebas grabadas

1797014 it is like a minestrone and a lot of the vegetables are plastic
1797015 i found 26 pieces of plastic all different colors inside one stomach
1797016 the experts say there is no silver bullet we are going to keep looking but at the moment it is not clear what the best course of action would be to deal with the materials that are already there
1797017 the planet is a closed system so everything that happens on earth stays on earth
1797018 what we need to do is to accept responsibility at the local level and rescue the amount of plastic that comes down our waterways and into our ocean
1797019 they are all talking out of the same music book i mean they are all talking out of the same song sheet that was written by mike madigan
1797020 you know we did a little homework and we found out some of the things that he said when governor thompson was governor and governor edgar was governor the same things he says now he was saying back then these are just tactics they are tactics they are politics its the games they play and thats why its so frustrating and so disappointing that you would screw with the lives of people because you have your own political agenda
1797021 i dont think its satisfactory for him to simply say i dont want to get between madigan and the governor he should get involved and have those chicago democrats many of whom are city workers who voted to kill the jobs bill get down there and vote to create this jobs bill stimulate our economy and help chicago
1797022 i think its time for mayor daley to start helping to get this done
1797023 well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1797024 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
1797025 to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
1797026 obviously theres no closure as of yet but i think weve kind of been told whats going on and i think we all kind of know where everything stands
1797027 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of
1797028 now its just about the packers and not about the situation
1797029 its over now from what i understand its pretty much over
1797030 i think for the most part the locker room would have liked to see him back here
1797031 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1797032 he needs to jump on the train and lets go
1797033 or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1797034 walter is a young athletic small forward with good size and intriguing skills

1797038 the usual setup for the pga is more like a tough u s tour event
1797039 its actually like they switched the two of them around this year
1797040 it doesnt seem long because youve just come from birkdale
1797041 but its four inches and thick enough if youre more than 100 yards youre not going to get to the green from too many lies
1797042 the whole golf course really feels and plays like a major should
1797043 but i can see it going the other way too
1797044 this has the potential to play as the hardest major
1797045 usually of the four majors if you played your best you could score here now you could play great and 70 might be awesome
1797046 you look at guys who have not won majors who at my age 38 or even past my age who are playing well this year
1797047 they can break through theres a lot of guys playing very good golf

1797053 there is no greater love than to lay down your life for the sake of your brother
1797054 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
1797055 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
1797056 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
1797057 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
1797058 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
1797059 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
1797060 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
1797061 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
1797062 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together

1797130 i think love is more not finding that perfect person but loving a person for their imperfections its about sharing the remote control
1797131 have you ever seen the wedding singer with adam sandler
1797132 yes you will its stupid its just a song he sings you asked me what i thought love was and well that song is nevermind

1797135 according to jack lemmon death ends a life not a relationship hero when i die will you promise me that our friendship will still remain the same
1797136 put all the stuff back yeah though some of it were gonna have to pay for like the clothes
1797137 when you and i were on the boat i used to dream that wed be cast away somewhere you know your standard tropical island with the white sand beaches and giant stars overhead we have no clothes to wear and wed splash in the surf all day and then at night the moon would be this well this giant thing and it was always full
1797138 i like this fantasy id catch fish with my bare hands make fire without matches
1797139 there are about a thousand reasons why you and i would never work
1797140 and im still thinking about it and i miss you mine
1797141 no no no i think now would be a good time
1797142 like i mean youre allowed to like test things and stuff but the manager is gonna be like his mind is gonna be blown
1797143 this no need to call the manager cause you know we were just about to leave
1797144 no we just sleep together from time to time do you have a problem with that
1797145 that was quite a show you put up for that poor boy
1797146 yeah well i just wanted to introduce him to the realities of the 21st century good girls go to heaven and bad girls go everywhere
1797147 so bad girls go and spend the night with some guy they casually know in a k mart huh
1797148 what else do bad girls of the 21st century do
1797149 yes everything they want to make their dreams come true whatever it may take
1797150 ohh im sorry i i didnt know somebody was in here
1797151 youd better get dressed or well have to face the managers rage
1797152 i got it seems a small price to pay for a dream come true
1797153 i certainly hope you found everything you were looking for today
1797154 well not everything but we found what we needed which as im sure you know is sometimes just as important in a spiritual sense cause you know if you found everything that you needed today what would be the point of waking up tomorrow and doing it all over again it just wouldnt seem worth it
1797155 dont worry hes on a one day pass from the asylum
1797156 but in all fairness i should let you know that i will be writing a letter to the home office about this
1797157 yeah because this store is perfect just the way it is dont change a thing
1797158 you know you could offer to carry one of these things
1797159 do i appear to have lost consciousness because thats the only circumstances under which you would be driving my car
1797160 you wouldnt have this problem if you hadnt taught me how to drive in the first place
1797161 youll see your way into the backseat if you keep this up
1797162 why would you let me if i really wanted to
1797163 youd be the only one i would ever let touch my baby and only because i know that i eventually managed to show you how to drive stick and how youre supposed to touch a stick in the right way
1797164 awww hero im feeling really honored but i think ill have to take a rain check on that im a little tired and i dont want to take any chances with your baby but thank you
1797165 you know its getting late and it would be even later if you have to drive back home before going to work and worthington is somewhat in the middle between your house and your office so i thought
1797166 maybe youd like to come up to my room to take a shower and we could have some breakfast before you go to work
1797167 im sorry that you missed your no strings attached date
1797168 no i wouldnt exchange last night for anything else in the world
1797169 now go and take your shower ive more time left than you and while you freshen up i get some breakfast for us okay
1797170 no known solution today offers the early results of this patent pending technology
1797171 the device is able to provide a configuring solution to get 100 percent readability of rfid tags passing through a read zone
1797172 the ddcs support of the rfid startup through the esp program is another indication of the benefits to a focused regional strategy that builds on daytons strengths
1797173 the regions history in developing barcode technology and point of purchase systems makes dayton the location of choice for companies who are implementing next generation rfid products
1797174 we have noticed that using different vendors for tags and readers can lead to a lack of accountability in the applications success it was very important to us that one vendor guarantee the complete solution by providing both readers and tags
1797175 we chose the alien solution because aliens hardware out performs all other readers and tags in the marketplace today
1797176 a typical rfid installation addresses the automation or streamlining of a particular process but the lcwaikiki deployment is unique in that aliens rfid solutions are being used as the central data capture method for storing all retail data
1797177 the lcwaikiki project represents one of europes first full scale rfid installations in a retail environment and is a highly effective application that addresses lcwaikikis business needs and provides measurable return on investment
1797178 has repeatedly brought forth proposals to increase domestic supply reduce the price at the pump protect american consumers and businesses and promote renewable energy and conservation
1797179 to date democrats have brought forward 13 major initiatives to accomplish the above goals and each time a majority of house republicans have voted against these proposals
1797180 deserve to know why their representatives in congress have failed to support serious responsible proposals
1797181 senator mccain missed two critical votes in the senate to promote renewable and conservation the american people have a right to know why he is putting the interests of big oil ahead of american consumers why is that
1797182 if house republicans are for all of the above why do you oppose efforts to protect consumers like price gouging and holding opec accountable for price fixing
1797183 the more that pelosi and senate leader harry reid are clearly the anti energy obstacles the harder it is for democrats back home to get re elected
1797184 if the democrats dont find a way to pass a big energy bill i think theyre in extraordinary trouble
1797185 once again speaker pelosi and democrat leaders of congress have broken trust with the american people and shown themselves to be completely indifferent to reality
1797186 i look forward to joining my colleagues who are choosing to stand firm and demand a fair vote on energy legislation on behalf of the american people
1797187 i stopped it early because i didnt think our team was handling it appropriately
1797188 they are getting more and more aggressive i liked the practice maybe our best one to date up until that point and there were a couple of shots i didnt think needed to be taken and i think there was a teachable moment there i thought the team could benefit from
1797189 and if they cant play football maybe they will listen to the rules of engagement in the team periods
1797190 there might be a very similar thing happen tomorrow that happened today and eventually they will learn what scrimmage tempo means and team tempo means
1797191 theyre the best experts to predict what theyre going to need to manage their area of operation
1797192 as far as the activity going on here in san diego the agents are needed
1797193 congress giveth and taketh away so you cant just thumb your nose at congress and say were going to make these decisions based only on our enforcement needs
1797194 they say they have a formula but im not convinced or persuaded that this is altogether a rational distribution of resources theres a certain amount of whoever screams and yells gets taken care of first
1797195 due to heavy turnouts republicans will vote on tuesday and democrats on wednesday
1797196 never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world
1797197 who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies
1797198 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
1797199 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like
1797200 everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
1797201 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love

1797204 there are a lot of fashions and fads in england
1797205 its not that theres one particular style of band that excels that changes very regularly so theres like a flavor of the month and if youre not that its very hard to break through the indie scene and we just werent that at the time
1797206 we felt that it was going to be easier to get to a point over here than it would be in england
1797207 but i just wanted to make sure there was something there before everybody came so i went over and set up a few things
1797208 we became a band in leeds and we finished the album in new york so a town and two cities summed up our journey to get to this point
1797209 and all the songs on the album are about everything in between
1797210 it is very moving for me to know that the christian organizations which were in very close contact with my father are at our side and are helping us perpetuate his memory

1797222 the happy stranger saved me and sat me back on the wall and told me to be a good girl and the angry stranger was mad
1797223 shes just all over me about stuff that i enjoy doing that doesnt include her
1797224 yeah i mean check it out bobby and i play world of warcraft every tuesday night weve played it way before i even knew she existed but now every time tuesday afternoon comes around she starts in on me with like a flood of texts about am i gonna come and see her can she come over to my house are we gonna hang out at the movies
1797225 i dont think i can have a girlfriend who wont let me be myself you know let me do what i do even when it doesnt involve her
1797226 theyve been trying to get my attention ever since they came in

1797232 his european perspective on american liberty often catches me off guard but i am never sorry when i read his site
1797233 mercilessly skewers the idiocy of the nanny state with a wry sense of humor that makes it a daily must read
1797234 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
1797235 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
1797236 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
1797237 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
1797238 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
1797239 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this marine national monument

1797260 the internet causes billions of images to appear on millions of computer monitors around the planet
1797261 the real faith of which we speak will not allow itself to be made out of our thought because it is a pure work of god in us without our being able to add anything we do to it thus st paul says in romans 5 15 it is gods gift of grace won for us through christ that is why it is such a mighty active restless and busy thing which immediately renews the person gives a second birth and leads the person into new ways and into new being it is impossible for this same self not to do good works continuously spontaneously without interruption
1797262 faith is not a work but the lord and life of all works

1797294 you know i dont want to argue with chapman and roberts and stiglitz and all these experts because they are almost always right but my gut tells me and im probably wrong theyre saying that we still have two and a half years until
1797295 huh tornado f3 200 mph winds oh uh well im just not interested in meteorology
1797296 for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled

1797298 if a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered he shall pay the girls father fifty shekels of silver he must marry the girl for he has violated her he can never divorce her as long as he lives
1797299 the priests did not ask where is the lord those who deal taphas with the law did not know me the leaders rebelled against me the prophets prophesied by baal following worthless idols
1797300 and the lord spoke to moses saying speak to the children of israel and say to them if any mans wife goes astray and behaves unfaithfully toward him and a man lies shakab with her carnally and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and it is concealed that she has defiled herself and there was no witness against her nor was she caught
1797301 if a man lies with a woman so that there is a seminal emission they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until evening
1797302 if a man find a damsel who is a virgin who is not betrothed and lay hold on her and lie with her and they be found third millennium
1797303 but if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the countryside and the man forces chazaq her and lies with her then only the man who lay with her shall die but you shall do nothing to the young woman there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him even so is this matter for he found her in the countryside and the betrothed young woman cried out but there was no one to save her if a man finds a young woman who is a virgin who is not betrothed and he seizes her and lies with her and they are found out then the man who lay with her shall give to the young womans father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her he shall not be permitted to divorce her all his days
1797304 now dinah the daughter of leah whom she had borne to jacob went out to see the women of the land and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite the prince of the land saw her he seized laqach her and lay shakab with her and humiliated anah her and his soul was drawn to dinah the daughter of jacob he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her so shechem spoke to his father hamor saying get me this girl for my wife now jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter dinah but his sons were with his livestock in the field so jacob held his peace until they came and hamor the father of shechem went out to jacob to speak with him the sons of jacob had come in from the field as soon as they heard of it and the men were indignant and very angry because he had done an outrageous thing nbalah in israel by lying with jacobs daughter for such a thing must not be done
1797305 then amnon said to tamar bring the food into the chamber that i may eat from your hand
1797306 put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her
1797307 if a man entices pathah a virgin who is not betrothed and lies shakab with her he shall surely pay the bride price for her to be his wife if her father utterly refuses to give her to him he shall pay money according to the bride price of virgins
1797308 therefore i am now going to allure pathath her i will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her
1797309 when i get a little money i buy books and if any is left i buy food and clothes

1797316 it turns out that the solid game mechanics and whimsical fantasy environment appeal even beyond the tween audience weve had a great response from testers that included everyone from grandmas who play with a grandchild sitting in their lap to twenty something traditional gamers
1797317 wizard101 is a great game for the whole family especially for kids i watch my 6 year old and my 14 year old laughing with each other instead of irritating one another as brothers tend to do i play right along side of my kids
1797318 having been a gamer for 30 years now playing with my kids has to be the most fun i have ever had they enjoy the ability to get many different spells and see all the amazing animations and both are always wanting to start new wizards to try the others i think the variety of schools and the spells that goes with them makes wizard101 stand out over other online games

1797320 we are ambitious for the future of superannuation but we cant do anything unless we do it within a responsible fiscal envelope
1797321 at the moment we have judged that we need to look at all of the issues to do with superannuation and its intersection with the transfer payment system and thats why were looking at the review
1797322 i completely reject the notion that the government is doing nothing in this area
1797323 he is a guy without imagination and hes a guy without courage and that point was proven by the fact that he let howard stay there for so long
1797324 we cant get to where we lose our cool out here its that time of year guys arent in very good moods out here weve just got to make sure we continue to get better its good to see us compete and those things well get rid of the extracurricular stuff it wasnt anything big a couple of little ones
1797325 we were anticipating it and we need that as a football team
1797326 after a while it kind of got excessive as far as the banging and guys trying us we needed that thats something were trying to build on is our toughness and at the same time build on our mental toughness
1797327 you know this defense were a tough rough defense we dont back down from anybody and thats how weve always played
1797328 ever since that day that lance schulters gave us that nickname the tennessee tyrants thats what weve been trying to live up to

1797331 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
1797332 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth
1797333 as a practicing periodontist i am constantly telling my patients to clean between their teeth more using dental floss or interdental cleaners
1797334 patients tend to think that flossing cant possibly make that much of a difference but this study demonstrates that the addition of flossing to your dental hygiene routine can significantly reduce the amount of periodontal disease causing bacteria even after just two weeks
1797335 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
1797336 these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
1797337 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
1797338 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
1797339 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship
1797340 abstinence only programs often only look at the negatives of sex not the positive this is especially important for young women who need to have control over having sex and having safe sex
1797341 with these programs you often hear sex just happens and adolescents are having less safe sex this detracts from adolescents having a choice and this leads to more dangerous sex with more sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies
1797342 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
1797343 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
1797344 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
1797345 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada
1797346 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
1797347 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
1797348 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
1797349 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
1797350 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
1797351 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
1797352 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
1797353 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
1797354 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together

1797400 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
1797401 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
1797402 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
1797403 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity

1797430 virtual worlds newsis the leading vws news provider in the world there isnt a day that we at dutch exchange do not check their website so why not incorporate their news into our own exchange and community environment as weve agreed with them to do so and bring the news of what is actually happening at the moment closer to our customers
1797431 for anyone thats participated in virtual worlds third party creators are important to development and certainly a core part of our strategy
1797432 from day one weve wanted a community developing content and experiences for anywhere on the web tomorrow we begin accepting submissions for content into the development program and explore the future of how this plays out
1797433 the control will still reside with vivaty and part of that is to ensure theres quality control and things like that
1797434 part of it is also to explore what types of things developers are attracted to from there as we understand what the community is used to well optimize the tools then quite frankly we want to get out of the way
1797435 the next phase for us is to really open up the platform broadly and get that out there
1797436 in the beginning phase we want to make sure were working with developers to make sure it fits their needs
1797437 were trying to find a way for a large audience to participate in a 3d virtual world without a client
1797438 those developers are looking at us to be a conduit its meeting a user need and artists need and we want to bring that together second we think its important to have a wide array of compelling content for people to interact in if it was just us creating everything that would be much harder
1797439 its safe to say its of strong interest to us
1797440 weve seen a lot of interest from a wide variety of people in the marketplace from traditional studios and artists to more notable third parties who are maybe more focused on brand experiences
1797441 were still in the middle of figuring out what the right solution is were very interested in the right way to serve partners those being both brands and then developers

1797461 our hope is to realign a date to that facility if we were to close on that transaction and well be able to have a board discussion on that soon

1797479 zegt ze dat echt geweldig begrijp me niet verkeerd ik vindt het absoluut niet schattig of schilderachtig dat jullie elkaar in belgi constant in de haren zitten maar hoe ouder ik word hoe meer ik ervan overtuigd raak dat mensen met culturele verschillen simpelweg niet rimpelloos kunnen samenleven kun jij een land bedenken waar zoiets werkt brazili misschien ik dacht het niet neem nu zwitserland daar spreken ze frans duits italiaans en romansch vroeger dacht ik altijd dat al die verschillende culturen gezellig in n grote smeltpot leefden grooving along merrily was me dat een schok toen ik er voor het eerst kwam ze bleken daar allemaal netjes gescheiden in afzonderlijke kantons te wonen en gen ve is gewoonweg franser dan frankrijk
1797480 weet ik niet daarvoor ken ik te weinig van de situatie kijk ik wil hier allerminst pleiten voor wat dan ook ik denk gewoon dat het nooit cht zal boteren tussen verschillende culturen in n land hoezeer goedmenende mensen zoals ik en hopelijk jij dat ook zouden willen helaas maar laat dat jullie er vooral niet van weerhouden om mij nog een uit te nodigen in gent haha weet je hoe dat festival heet waar ik toen heb opgetreden
1797481 nah ik zou het niet eens willen om twee uur s middags in een tent spelen terwijl je weet dat het publiek op de grote namen staat te wachten neem nu the who om maar meteen de beste rockband aller tijden te noemen daar kun je toch onmogelijk mee concurreren wanneer je in je eentje satirische liedjes zit te zingen aan de piano
1797482 ruim negen jaar heeft randy newman zijn cynisme zijn zwarte humor en zijn inside jokes ter wille van ome walt disney waarvoor rn veel filmmuziek schrijft achterwege moeten laten maar heden zit de enige echte dean of satire weer pontificaal op zijn troon
1797483 like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1797484 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1797485 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1797486 it doesnt look good to say we need more oil but then export the refined products that youre getting it doesnt seem to be consistent
1797487 the fact is that the united states participates in global markets for both crude and refined products and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets
1797488 forbidding exports of u s petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce and could potentially lead to higher prices if u s production or refining declined
1797489 akin to investing in whale blubber harvesting back in the late 19th century
1797490 reliance on oil is ending just like that of whale blubber did over a 100 years ago
1797491 my point is that it makes no sense for taxpayers to subsidize oil exploration when oil producers have more money than god and dont spend enough of their own lucre in the process
1797492 average costs to find and develop oil and gas reserves have tripled since 1997 while total reserve replacement costs have more than doubled
1797493 they know how to run a successful oil company if they get their way it wouldnt take them a year to run exxon into the ground
1797494 having more oil exports would tend to reduce the trade deficit
1797495 considering that more registered dems voted for her in the primary than did for obama
1797496 the three i passed looked right at me and didnt bother to stop me
1797497 im still not over living in wyoming i look everyone on the street in the eye like im ready to say hello and make a new friend
1797498 the city i didnt know hc lived in los angeles
1797499 obama running mate could come from left field fans of evan bayh the clean cut senator for indiana are hoping today will be the day he is selected as barack obamas vice presidential running mate they are likely to be disappointed obama officials say privately it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver in spite of ever more feverish speculation about who mr obama is likely to choose hillary clinton having made a comeback in the past few days the decision is unlikely to be leaked in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals it doesnt go much beyond this circle says a senior obama staffer others may be consulted on a case by case basis but only the davids and robert are always inside the circle it is even unclear whether mr obama has yet whittled his choice down to a shortlist but a straw poll of obama staff members and democrats close to the campaign suggests that five or six names recur each is deemed capable of helping to neutralise one or more of mr obamas perceived weaknesses inexperience lack of national security credentials the perception that he is aloof and his poor record of winning over blue collar voters in swing states of the rust belt all are evaluated principally on their ability to help mr obama win in november as opposed to the contributions they might make to an administration in addition good personal chemistry is essential

1797501 federal government were not even telling you that your laws are unconstitutional were just insisting that you to obey your own laws

1797506 i feel that the author hasnt read x y and z though these works have been cited in the references sure the author makes a good argument but i disagree with it
1797507 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1797508 you guys are the ones talking about it im not
1797509 after lighting it my mind went blank and then i just wanted to hurry up running ahead
1797510 this is a moment of great pride to the 1 3 billion chinese people
1797511 i send my prayers and good wishes for the success of this event
1797512 its not just about the sport its about the image of china
1797513 chairman mao would have been happy if he were here today
1797514 all the way for me i want to see the x men eating at la taqueria on 26th and mission and enjoying the carne asada taco i want to see x men member emma frost getting out of bed in a monta ellis golden state warriors jersey i want to feel that culture
1797515 kids were active people walked more now you go half a mile and you take your car
1797516 im helping families cope emotionally and helping adults and couples just to be able to do better
1797517 i woke up and i thought i was dead all the nurses were nuns and the head nun was in an outfit like the flying nun
1797518 the reason im a diabetes educator is because i remember the teaching nurses at the joslin clinic
1797519 they have this delusion that they can protect their child from anything
1797520 despite their best efforts and intentions there are some things they cannot prevent from happening to their child and thats a difficult thing to come to terms with parents think that if it hadnt been for my genes they wouldnt have gotten it
1797521 whether youre a one year old or an 18 year old youre still their kid
1797522 we lay down and as we were falling asleep the heart monitors went off
1797523 it was such a scary thing at that moment because of what had happened to the little boy
1797524 i have to get parents to get non compliant pain in the ass teenagers to do what they need to do about their diabetes
1797525 my no 1 concern is passing it on to a child i would just feel guilty
1797526 you see how difficult it is and you dont want to pass it on to someone else
1797527 when youre in your mid 20s theres the fine line when your parents stop influencing your decisions
1797528 and with diabetes that just adds on to the difficulty
1797529 by the time the diabetic is 40 or 50 years old they often say i dont know my parents always managed my diabetes
1797530 if she felt as though she is in allison and thomas shadow
1797531 when i met my husband i didnt think that he was in the best control and i tried to assume the role of managing him
1797532 but its not my diabetes its not my disease i can do everything i can to help but in the end its up to him
1797533 coming to terms with the fact that you didnt schedule it it imposes itself upon you
1797534 they need to find the emotional where with all to dig deep down and find how they are going to do all this work because its like a full time job
1797535 its a coping mechanism so you block out some of the more traumatic parts
1797536 when they used to test they would use like antiquated lancets small needles used for testing blood glucose i just remember my finger would be bruised for weeks afterwards it was some absurdly sadistic machine
1797537 he riismandel is extremely self reliant on one hand its sort of awe inspiring but its also kind of frustrating if the person wont ask for help with things
1797538 once we are married ill be the typical nagging wife with a frying pan he can be as self reliant as he wants but then we will have the day to day together
1797539 i dont think you need to be mother theresa to live with someone who has diabetes but you need to be caring and have your sh together
1797540 i wasnt walking straight and my resident assistants found out i was diabetic and they made me go to the hospital
1797541 if it had been any other person they wouldnt have to go
1797542 when i talk to my friends from college they are like we didnt even know you had it
1797543 well thats because i didnt really talk to you about it
1797544 i have a lady who passes out in church regularly because she doesnt want to take her insulin when she is out all day
1797545 i do a good job of hiding it i dont know if people really ever even see the pump
1797546 somewhere between the ages of 60 and 75 he had the onset of complications he had dialysis before he was 70 since then he has had four vessel bypasses laser surgery for r etinopathy and a kidney transplant hes fine now hes a cat with nine diabetes lives
1797547 its bad enough getting old but to have your foot amputated or go blind those are definite concerns
1797548 at that point i was willing to talk about diabetes but these people could not do it
1797549 so they would gripe and moan and it just wasnt me and i went back and i was like i cant sit in these support groups
1797550 i dont have a problem telling people i have diabetes now
1797551 they would say mom i dont want to bring those cupcakes to school because allison cant have one
1797552 he never counts on anything until he sees it right in front of him
1797553 he cant go into the mountains with just sandals for three months i dont think he really cares but im sure its frustrating to know
1797554 when i was diagnosed in the early 1980s they told me id never play sports sh that was so crazy

1797568 non differenziamo i nostri fan in base alla nazionalit li consideriamo come un tuttuno come ununit con la quale percorriamo una strada siamo un grande team e ci rendono veramente orgogliosi
1797569 di recente una fan si introdotta nel camerino era nel backstage al secondo piano non sappiamo ancora adesso come abbia fatto ad entrare tutti eravamo sorpresi ma ci sarebbero anche molte altre cose incredibili da raccontare

1797576 wang on the dl 3 straight seasons his injury really really hurt do not give me the age bs the guy is 28 now the yanks have done everything right with this guy he just cannot stay healthy
1797577 six runs in the bottom of the ninth without recording an out impressive stuff
1797578 wang on the dl 3 straight seasons his injury really really hurt do not give me the age bs the guy is 28 now the yanks have done everything right with this guy he just cannot stay healthy
1797579 tk he did win 38 games so does not negate he gets hurt all the damn time why is the truth so hard to comprehend
1797580 putting him on the 15 day dl is good news however faint if they were absolutely sure joba was done for the season they would have put him on the 60 day dl to clear a spot on the 40 man roster of course they might be waiting for andrews opinion before making the final move
1797581 i did not say all the time i said more then he should
1797582 phil hughes ian kennedy brian bruney a rod jorge matsui damon chien meng joba and probably more if we dont make the playoffs at least we have a reason next year were gonna be amazing
1797583 putting him on the 15 day dl is good news however faint if they were absolutely sure joba was done for the season they would have put him on the 60 day dl to clear a spot on the 40 man roster of course they might be waiting for andrews opinion before making the final move
1797584 injuries to the yankees phil hughes ian kennedy brian bruney a rod jorge matsui damon chien meng joba and probably more if we dont make the playoffs at least we have a reason next year were gonna be amazing
1797585 this guy will come up and hit 300 and will be the difference maker
1797586 when putting together the roster last winter he obviously made a huge error in judgement when he relied on 2 young pitchers
1797587 tk you must be in the stupid column along with cb pat m sj and the others who cannot understand where this frustrated little leaguer is coming from
1797588 if i recall correctly wang started 07 on dl with a pulled hamstring and missed the month of april hardly a devastating injury he definitely isnt fragile
1797589 tk f yourself again read my posts the 28 yr old ace needs to pitch
1797590 if he wants to make huge dollars they need him to be more durable
1797591 i dont know if anyone has answered this already if joba cant go this year i see he only has 89 innings pitched does he go back to the bullpen come 09 and do it all over
1797592 again read my posts the 28 yr old ace needs to pitch he cannot get hurt running almost in place around the bases if he wants to make huge dollars they need him to be more durable this injury has cost wangs wallet a bunch of green
1797593 stuart im not trying to pile on here but would you consider utilizing some type of stuart to english program when you post here

1797645 most laws relating to sex center on restricting non reproductive sex as a way of controlling different behavior
1797646 that is why there are always problems with religion and things like contraception because use of such promotes a hedonistic image of sex
1797647 laws relating to sex crimes are the easiest to change
1797648 all you basically need is a public outcry and politicians act soon after
1797649 california is liberated things like cohabitation anal sex s amp m oral sex heterosexual or otherwise are not illegal
1797650 the only limit to sexual practices in this state is that sex in any shape or form must take place between two adults and only two
1797651 kiefer and i after the writers strike were sort of riffing a bit about some of the africa story that had been discarded
1797652 we went down to south africa for i think three days and the rest of it would be simi valley pretending to be south africa we told them it would be a really difficult shoot and they accepted it right away and said do the whole thing there it all turned out pretty exciting for us
1797653 when we went to africa we went with one of the best scripts weve ever had thank you howard gordon for that we didnt have to rush it like we normally do and it kind of set a precedent for the rest of the season for how we were going to approach it there is nothing in my twenty two years of experience like going on location to help you bridge to reality that young boy is one of the finest actors ive ever worked with
1797654 its allowed us to really flesh out the stories in a way weve never been able to its allowed us the freedom and creativity to really make season seven much deeper
1797655 ive become an alcoholic since i started writing this show its just been absolutely amazing for me
1797656 first off i got to work with my brother which is really cool i jumped in the middle of the season and brannon said there is nothing that can prepare you so now i am just happy and i sort of see my self as the other carlos
1797657 i have to basically write the show for them its not easy
1797658 no its been amazing really since the very first day of the show its been this amazing mixture of people we know that when this is done its never going to happen again i think its been my most fun year
1797659 this is the fourth time he has died but you know we love this character i do credit manny and david fury for insisting almeda was not dead they had an idea to bring him back last year and you know we didnt like how he died we just were not happy with that death
1797660 i think one of the most difficult thing for the course of the show has been working with phenomenal actors who eventually depart
1797661 i have to tell you the stuff we did in africa for this prequel is right up there i am an optimist for the future so i am going to say we have not made my favorite episode yet
1797662 im going to say my favorite episode is in this season
1797663 were not trying to reinvent the show every year we take what you all have told us what you like through the internet through fan mail and fan phone calls we try every year to take out what you dont like put in what you do like for the writers its an unbelievable challenge
1797664 i think one of the coolest things about season seven that i am really excited about is for the most part hes trying to be better and i think thats something that i really loved about the character
1797665 theres a real growth to each character youre following along on that path for me it was very organic it felt very natural to me

1797686 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability

1797712 one of the most violent terrorist organisations in the world
1797713 we dont even know one day where hell be the next and we dont know how well be able to visit him
1797714 if he does testify no matter what he says the prosecutor will charge him with perjury hes made that pretty clear to us
1797715 if he does not testify he can be charged with contempt and that was the road that my father chose one that was more principled i think in terms of his taking a stand against the governments abuse of power
1797716 if they can kill each other during ramadan they can appear before the grand jury all they cant do is eat before sunset
1797717 i am not going to put off dr grand jury appearance to assist in what is becoming the islamisation of america
1797718 hes been singled out because hes been an effective courageous man
1797719 this all stems from aipac the american israel public affairs committee
1797720 this guy is just speaking out very effectively for the palestinian cause thats what is the root of this and the government is trying to stifle that
1797721 i believe that the defence is on firm ground saying that this is a case of political persecution
1797722 in fact i am hard pressed to find another case just like it
1797723 the prosecutions conduct is typical of the bush administration in that it will not accept defeat whether from a jury or a judge
1797724 when they fail to get the relief they seek they simply connive another way to secure it
1797725 now the light was fading fast we had to hurry to reach the gate before 7 pm but just as we were leaving the plains dave said urgently stop stop thirty yards from the road a lion and lioness stood silhouetted by the setting sun she moved against him rubbing her body on his great shaggy main and twitched her tail high in the air then blatantly sensual she crouched on the ground and the big male mounted her the coupling was brief and ended with a climax of impressive snarls before she rolled onto her back in evident satisfaction

1797727 dean gets out of hell we knew that day one in the writers room so we said lets not be coy about it lets get him out of hell but lets get him out mysteriously and lets have one of the big questions be how did he get out and who got him out and why and so we quickly get past what everyone knows and we get onto the things that they dont know
1797728 sam and dean are always so on top of each other its like they know what each others thinking now we pick up the series four months later and let the boys surprise each other again have them keeping secrets from each other again and have reveals about who they are and what happened in this four months that they were apart
1797729 we try not to be formulaic and we try to keep people guessing its like the way bruce willis finally got to do what he wanted when he made hudson hawk so im going to make season four of supernatural its gonna rock the third episode is a completely black and white throwback to the universal monster movies of the 30s so thatll be cool the fourth episode is a time travel episode where they go back and meet their parents when they were younger and we just came up with this episode ben edlund is writing it its like insane on a level that is even for us insane where a town has a wishing well and everyones wishes are coming true there may or may not be a seven foot tall talking teddy bear in it were not sure yet
1797730 dude we cant afford a chupacabra unless the chupacabra looks like a person who says im a chupacabra
1797731 we learned really early after the wendigo episode dont mount creatures you cant afford to produce theyre just gonna look stupid do it well or dont do it is the plan thats why there have been no chupacabras thats why our werewolves have yellow eyes and fangs and are otherwise human every so often theres off camera references to the chupacabra two states over and thats wherell they live
1797732 i think no one believes me but i really feel like that would be a favor to the fans better to have wow that was great and what a satisfying ending rather than literally jumping sharks and bringing in raven simone to play the cute little adopted orphan and weddings in hawaii i feel buffy did it pretty well you know it ended and that was a great final episode never say never i guess but at this point jensen jared and my contracts are all up at year five and id rather just go out bold so thats my plan
1797733 beginnings are easy because youre launching everything endings are easy the middles kinda shitty and hard to write
1797734 i have mixed feelings about season three i think we had some great episodes but i feel it was probably my least favorite season i think thats because its the middle and its that weird transition point now pieces are falling back and momentum is starting to build again towards something so i think its actually been a real magnifying focus on our energy
1797735 i think weve got a exciting season in store were doing what we want to do and were doing it without compromise im excited for the fans they might say kripkes gone total bat shit and its terrible but im entertained by it its something i like and so well see if everyone else likes it and if not well go watch greys
1797736 i know people think im some stupid cab driver but i have a great life and im thankful every day for what god has given to me i call my family in the morning and then pray to god for an hour i pray to god at lunch and then at night i call my family and pray to god again i love my life and am very happy and proud and i wouldnt change anything
1797737 so were not competing with taquerias were a quick service restaurant and value and convenience are our core pillars

1797739 globalized industrialized food is not cheap it is too costly for the earth for the farmers for our health the earth can no longer carry the burden of groundwater mining pesticide pollution disappearance of species and destabilization of the climate farmers can no longer carry the burden of debt which is inevitable in industrial farming with its high costs of production it is incapable of producing safe culturally appropriate tasty quality food and it is incapable of producing enough food for all because it is wasteful of land water and energy industrial agriculture uses ten times more energy than it produces it is thus ten times less efficient

1797808 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
1797809 we cant get to where we lose our cool out here its that time of year guys arent in very good moods out here weve just got to make sure we continue to get better its good to see us compete and those things well get rid of the extracurricular stuff it wasnt anything big a couple of little ones

1797823 when you get into mockery thats where you potentially do more harm than good
1797824 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1797825 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires

1797839 sen mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists
1797840 the candidates are responding to the fact that the public is hurting and crying for relief
1797841 i dont do things i would normally do right now
1797842 politically i think its the only domestic economically leaning issue where the republicans have a slight opportunity even advantage because of the trend in support for even greater exploration
1797843 i would have to lean more toward mccain with this offshore drilling
1797844 a plot aimed at strengthening the kurds further in kirkuk

1797856 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
1797857 if israeli u s or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
1797858 israel takes iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads statements regarding its destruction seriously israel cannot risk another holocaust
1797859 for israel this is not a target that cannot be achieved
1797860 actually increasing the nationalist fervor to build a nuclear weapon
1797861 a two three year delay is not worth it for a five to 10 year delay i would say yes
1797862 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1797863 the old cold war will not return and analogies with it are outdated but so are the rosy sentiments that succeeded it
1797864 but i googled myself and im not there why not
1797865 oh theres an opening in obamas cabinet you hadnt thought about that but this was even bigger at least to me
1797866 buddy a name id carried all my life hated and finally was able to lose by retraining everyone to call me charles do you compose music
1797867 how can you stand it i had to rent a canoe to go out to alans yacht to get him to finish a lyric can you see me paddling across the gulf of trieste you must have the patience of job
1797868 well there should be 100 000 people across the country who might be curious
1797869 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1797870 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1797871 if you asked hazem el masri about how i perceive muslims youll find ive often asked him questions about the religion because i dont fully understand it
1797872 if something comes up that i heard i ask him
1797873 its certainly not right of him to say that we took no interest in his home life or personal life
1797874 i supported him through the clovelly hotel thing when he was caught allegedly having sex in the toilets with ironwoman candice falzon his drink driving thing through his urinating in public thing
1797875 we stood up for him and did our best to try and get him through that so i think it is a pretty naive statement to make
1797876 in light of what has happened my advice about him not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1797877 who is he to come and question my friends and their values and their religion
1797878 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something
1797879 yeah whatever comes out of his mouth is that right
1797880 when i did join up with khoder and asked khoder to manage me
1797881 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1797882 i havent been happy at the dogs for a while
1797883 nothing to do with the players i love my close mates but a whole range of things
1797884 it wasnt that long ago that he signed a five year deal so i assumed to commit to somewhere for five years he was happy to commit to that
1797885 i know sonny has been going around crying poormouth about only earning 500 000 a year cant survive on that
1797886 i dont know if it is just this generation whether it is young footballers or generation y in general but they expect everything and dont want to cough up for it
1797887 they expect that everything is going to be given to them on a platter and the fact he cant survive on 500 000 a year is a bit sad really
1797888 he will do anything now to try and justify this decision regardless
1797889 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us five years
1797890 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1797891 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1797892 i think regime change would be preferable because i think that would lead to greater stability in the region as a whole
1797893 our best estimate is that physicians provide negative uncompensated care to the uninsured earning more on uninsured patients than on insured patients with comparable treatments
1797894 uninsured patients as a group still paid a higher percentage of charges on average than medicare and medicaid
1797895 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans
1797896 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
1797897 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
1797898 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
1797899 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
1797900 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like a little less conversation i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it
1797901 theres the feeling you can be whatever you want to be
1797902 it is my burden to prove that he was insane at the time of the commission of the offense
1797903 it is absolutely critical a mental health expert see him now at this critical stage
1797904 jury has never found a defendant not guilty by reason of insanity in a contested case there have been times when defendants have been found not guilty by reason of insanity but that is usually by agreement with the prosecutors
1797905 its been a dark day but it was necessary to show that the governing body and town will not tolerate this or any type of incident similar to this
1797906 marine reserves bill still languishing in parliament 6 years down the track because nzf wont provide the numbers to pass it
1797907 you know i could throw a 1 000 bill out of the window right now and make somebody very happy
1797908 i could throw ten 100 bills out of the window and make ten people very happy
1797909 i could throw one hundred 10 bills out of the window and make a hundred people very happy
1797910 many people living in the west are dissatisfied with their own society they despise it or accuse it of not being up to the level of maturity attained by mankind a number of such critics turn to socialism which is a false and dangerous current
1797911 because instant and credible information has to be given it becomes necessary to resort to guesswork rumors and suppositions to fill in the voids and none of them will ever be rectified they will stay on in the readers memory
1797912 lipper i think even asking that question is a turnoff 10 says that your ve karma is from chicks
1797913 very well known representatives of your society such as george kennan say we cannot apply moral criteria to politics
1797914 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the west today
1797915 political and intellectual functionaries exhibit this depression passivity and perplexity in their actions and their statements and even more so in their self serving rationales as to how realistic reasonable and intellectually and even morally justified it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice
1797916 must one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the first symptom of the end
1797917 prime minister helen clark denied yesterday that labour was polling voters on her response to the furore a move which could signal she had not ruled out a firmer line against mr peters
1797918 it would be news to me because neither i nor my staff nor the labour party have authorised any such polling
1797919 no polling companies generally will not and in fact can not disclose who their clients are for a specific poll unless authorised to do so by the client
1797920 has helen clark been decisive in her handling of the winston peters donations affair as was asked of me on monday night sound like something the evil empire of national and crosby textor would do
1797921 caught telling whats really planned to right wing supporters in secret
1797922 act is a party for pragmatic realists with a focus on the economic wellbeing of the country not extremists
1797923 extreme right as many others and as long as you agree that act are to the right of national my original point still stands even if you dont like my use of the e word
1797924 can you show me any proof that national has ever indulged in such disgusting gutter tactics
1797925 inventory2 2057 add karma subtract karma 0 says august 6th 2008 at 9 16 am ok philu so labour campaigned in 2005 on supporting anti smacking legislation on buying railways and blocking the aia sale yeah right
1797926 helen clark a lot of people arent comfortable with beatings but they dont want to see you know stressed and harassed parents you know pulled in by the police because they they smacked a child
1797927 wait a mo mr wilton for i presume it is thee over at the standard there is no secret agenda but explicit vicious attacks on workers the elderly maori etc could you please get the story straight
1797928 pushmepullu 330 add karma subtract karma 0 says august 6th 2008 at 9 50 am philu youve been promising a turnaround in the polls since april any reason why we should heed your predictions now when in the past they have proven so utterly wrong
1797929 gd 1350 add karma subtract karma 0 says august 6th 2008 at 9 55 am sigh for those socialist supporters who have forgotten or where in nappies in the 1980s let me remind you that your beloved heavenly leader and her deputy sherriff were both members of s government thatw as elected on a series of policies and then went on to implement a series of policies that were never part of their manifesto
1797930 if shes going to do everything from rort the electoral law to get journalist and author nicky hager to listen into our emails to go out there and get young labour affiliates to be bugging our personal conversations well thats her style of politics
1797931 so yes the nats were forced to go back on a few promises if it annoyed you as a student then too fucking bad
1797932 tane w i withdraw and apologise for the case of mistaken identity as well as the insult of being mistaken for a sub standard hack
1797933 last time the exclusive brethren became the centre of attention during the election campaign
1797934 labour are desperate to work up the fear of broken promises and secret agendas because once national is in office and does keep its promises they will never have that weapon again
1797935 everyone who disgrees with me must be in the pay of the secret conspiracy
1797936 i am really going to enjoy blogging the day after the election
1797937 i have a blog all ready to go which i will launch after the day after the election
1797938 hey this could have been a lot worse if the same thing had been done in the middle of the campaign
1797939 be afraid be very afraid because they say one thing in private and do another in public
1797940 everyone who disgrees with me must be in the pay of the secret conspiracy
1797941 a cookie my goodness your middle name must be lucky
1797942 its more of an artists community for a certain market segment that wanted something different theres been enough people that have come through that would say what a wonderful concept but then the market crashed and everyone went home
1797943 thats a soap opera and im glad its going on up there
1797944 they cant even pay attention to whats going on on the field
1797945 the favre situation is shaking aaron rodgers regardless of what theyre saying up there i think its shaking him
1797946 the coaches need to hurry up and get that under control
1797947 keep aaron rodgers in there because weve got to play them the third game on sept 21 so have aaron rodgers playing when we get there
1797948 i know their defense had film on him in their scrimmage and what did he do
1797949 aqui no clube nunca se tratou desse assunto nunca conversamos com ningu m sobre trocar o lulinha pelo morais
1797950 nunca ningu m do corinthians tratou desse assunto o lulinha nosso jogador e confiamos nele

1797957 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1797958 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1797959 if you go to the report you will see for yourself how communication was done from the top leadership in paris to the embassy in kigali and how different people who had a role in the genocide were housed at the embassy residence
1797960 i brought my family into things i had friends i had to stop associating with and ive got friends that im a lot closer with
1797961 as a small company we think that we can challenge the big guns with our new approach that pulls from all their results and pushes them on to a single results page say someone is really thirsty for any news updates on a given person or company using newsflashr theyll never miss a beat

1797972 his experience with the town of west hartfords downtown development project is also directly applicable to our own historic district revitalization effort here in folsom
1797973 this is a very exciting opportunity and i am eager to get started
1797974 folsom stands out from cities and towns across the nation in terms of its high quality of life and i know this will be a positive move both personally and professionally

1797977 it may be that brain hardware has co evolved with the internal virtual worlds that it creates this can be called hardware software co evolution
1797978 the patient typically finds himself impelled by some deep inner conviction that something is true or right or virtuous a conviction that doesnt seem to owe anything to evidence or reason but which nevertheless he feels as totally compelling and convincing we doctors refer to such a belief as faith
1797979 since our inner experiences consist of reproductions and combinations of sensory impressions the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning
1797980 we admit that we are like apes but we seldom realise that we
1797981 in support of its newly released documentary adventures in voice acting volume one this film details the rarely seen behind the mic world of the talented and diverse personalities that bring animated and video game characters to life
1797982 weve been grateful for the tremendous turnout at our most recent workshops which were held at two of the largest anime science fiction and entertainment industry events in north america and we look forward to the upcoming sessions at the 2008 new york anime festival
1797983 this event will feature several notable personalities including kyle hebert and steve blum as well as a very special opportunity for attendees to try their hand at voice acting with one of our recording engineers and receive pointers directly from the panelists well be on the look out for standout talent and those who are serious about pursuing a voice acting career to attend a separate off site intensive session to be held at a premier new york recording studio more details on that will be announced soon
1797984 the content is just as interesting as the people while most of the insight presented here can probably be found in extras scattered about innumerable anime dvds a more concentrated source of information on the business and its practicalities will be hard to find in various segments interviewees talk about the technical details of actual voice acting performances what the audition process involves how one can break into the business the kind of commitment it takes to do work like this what is needed to be good at the job and the practical realities of being a voice actor
1797985 adventures in voice acting holds great appeal for two types of audiences in unique ways for fans of anime it gives fascinating insights and interviews with the voice actors behind many acclaimed series that have helped to define the anime genre in the western hemisphere for those aspiring to become voice actors adventures in voice acting provides valuable information and frank discussion on what its really like to do this work ultimately weve made this documentary as a testament to the talent and dedication of these fine actors

1797990 im not a lawyer but the law is clear you cant spend more than the 6 000 on behalf of a candidate if you are coordinating with them period it is clear that there has been extensive coordination between mr mesi and a committee that wants to spend 1 million on his behalf
1797991 dnagents signaled the creator owned superhero craze years before it started
1797992 the work mark and will did foreshadowed a lot of what was to come in superheroes its very much the precursor to some of the biggest team books out today bringing dnagents under the image i and shadowline is a true pleasure and something ive hoped to do for years
1797993 jason aarons got another winner on his hands his first fill in issue of black panther is a fantastic traditional superhero story that demonstrates why the character is cool a concept that ive failed to see conveyed from the title before this one has easily leapt to the top half of the si tie ins
1797994 myspace is great because despite all the corporate stuff that covers the main pages it still has a feeling of being run by the users they have certain control of how much input they get and from whom and so i think it gives us access not just to our key age range audience but specifically to those who want to know what were up to more so than any other magazine or website
1797995 were getting at the people who want us to get at them and because of the incredibly broad audience we can justify the expense of doing free material something id wanted to do for a while an idea i love that i think the web is uniquely suited for
1797996 but im not going to complain it was nice to have the win for webcomic
1797997 to some degree it validates myspaces place in the comics landscape that it can bring such great material to people
1797998 for the very first time im able to create superheroes in the fantastic japanese manga style thanks to my lucky partnership with the great hiroyuki takei what a kick itll be to join hiroyuki san in offering brand new action packed stories to an army of readers in both the eastern and western worlds
1797999 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump
1798000 ultimo was developed as a true collaboration with stan lee sending his initial story idea to takei san who developed artwork and characters and reworked the plot to fit into the japanese manga storytelling style the result is something extremely compelling and we invite everyone to check out this historic release in our upcoming issue
1798001 both are stone professionals one a solider the other a cop and neither would admit to this whole
1798002 cable has a specific place and time in mind and hes making his way there in short jumps just to make sure hes covering his tracks
1798003 i think hes realized that his mission isnt simply keeping a football sized life form alive in the timestream hes going to have to raise her too and i like to think that sophie had a little to do with cracking his techno organic exterior a little
1798004 weve seen what cables been up to but what about those he left behind specifically cyclops who made a huge leap of faith by allowing his son to take the mutant messiah out into the timestream
1798005 and in a lot of ways cyclops story is the most heart wrenching bishop is dead certain in his beliefs so is cable but cyclops well
1798006 weve also been working together on a story arc of punisher max that will debut next january so michels probably getting really sick of me by now
1798007 this is one of the mysteries running through the series why the hell is bishop doing this youll see bits of this in king size cable but youll also see much more in issues to come
1798008 king size kicks off with bishop hot on cables trail and youll see exactly how he tracks his quarry through time its not what you saw in the first arc bishop has a trick up his sleeve
1798009 youre going to be seeing things change radically starting with 7 both cable and bishop have a clear idea on how to use time travel to definitively win this war and they couldnt be more different
1798010 cable will be squaring off against adversaries that are ridiculously hard to kill
1798011 cable will always have that sci fi spaghetti western tone imprinted on its dna
1798012 i wouldnt say dystopian though in fact the next story arc runs in the opposite direction for a while
1798013 with the thousands of readers we have worldwide now we wanted to produce exclusive chimaera universe content that they could easily get their hands on and is readily available at all times we have had a great response from wowio global and the fans and have exciting chimaera comics series underway and ready for distribution
1798014 someone asked a question about structure but as someone on the panel mentioned not me i basically just grumbled about the word because you can have the greatest grasp of structure in history and still churn out totally crap stories
1798015 less so that you know what rules to break because lets face it you dont have to know rules to break them but if you dont know whats already been done youre far less likely to break the rules that to waste a lot of valuable time reinventing the wheel and thats strictly a mugs game know what i mean
1798016 but the moment you let any one element even structure rule your life youre done
1798017 prior to that the town spoke not of acts but of reels though technology has obsolesced that term anyway
1798018 its strictly up to the financiers perception which is usually based on what has worked before and mutates with every new box office blockbuster and so regularly that very few movies ever get made
1798019 maybe when you start out many times unless youre a savant or very lucky
1798020 theres nothing more annoying than being accused of copying an idea you came up with years ago
1798021 all seven or eight of them left in the world
1798022 no evidence of a crime is necessary to convict for the crime
1798023 and theres no money in the budget for upgrading the system jeez youd think ahnuld would have enough pocket money to spring for a copy of quickbooks theyre reportedly looking for cobol savvy retirees
1798024 it could be a word a design element an artist anything really binds them together and can promote the website of their choice subject to my approval
1798025 i may not like them but certainly ill mention them

1798027 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of
1798028 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
1798029 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1798030 an engineer and near as i can tell a very good one
1798031 opinionated people who have no place making real engineering decisions
1798032 see msft doesnt give a crap about security i knew it m is teh evel
1798033 xense is designed to allow desktop users to create securely separated compartments to run applications that contain highly confidential information the system would prevent such data from overflowing from one compartment to another
1798034 what does your car design do to prevent it from being used as a getaway vehicle
1798035 someone fired a gun in an airplane cockpit and it was probably the pilot
1798036 it was harder to get at the keys in bde than in the other fde systems we attacked
1798037 enough to rooting so that the coming wave of ever more sophisticated and targeted 0 day roots are manageable as per vm annoyances rather than per system nightmares
1798038 outside of the context of the strong accountable identity their coporation owns
1798039 someone fired a gun in an airplane cockpit and it was probably the pilot
1798040 why yes little lady some of us sure do i carry a sig 357 its the same gun those air marshals use
1798041 of course but you need to understand that im a trained professional you cant just
1798042 if somebody who has the ability to fly a 747 across the pacific wants a gun you give it to them
1798043 i consider rare nds to be a very unfortunate but frankly acceptable side affect to allowing an armed populace just as i consider air crashes to be an acceptable result of flying
1798044 ground every plane remove their engines and bulldoze furrows across every airfield
1798045 someone fired a gun in an airplane cockpit and it was prob
1798046 someone fired a gun in an airplane cockpit and it was probably the pilot
1798047 being able to see a very faint object in the close vicinity of a bright one
1798048 we need to study the practicalities of deploying and flying these large optics
1798049 its certainly an interesting thing to pursue but by no means is this near the level of maturity needed to propose major space missions based on it
1798050 prior to this study the gravity tractor deflection technique had been proven in only a conceptual way
1798051 although there were few if any substantive criticisms of these concepts some of us had the feeling that the ideas were viewed as quaint but not ready for prime time
1798052 the jpl study gives it the solid engineering underpinnings that we never really doubted but now are there for anyone to see
1798053 the gravity tractor is a wimp but its a precise wimp
1798054 it can make very small precise changes in orbit and thats what you need to avoid a keyhole
1798055 we have a little bitty spacecraft with this monster swinging its butt at it
1798056 born of a single quantum event the universe is at some basic level a single interconnected quantum system there are no truly independent pieces of this system and therefore no random and uncontrollable interactions to impose a classical solidity on the quantum maelstrom once a quantum system always a quantum system
1798057 rotation of a superfluid is not uniform but takes place via a lattice of quantized vortices virtual planckian black holes
1798058 a more fundamental property than the disappearance of viscosity becomes visible if superfluid is placed in a rotating container
1798059 there could be a way to feel the ether more directly theory predicts that the quantum vacuum behaves in some ways like a viscous fluid according to general relativity a gravitational field is just a distortion of the geometry of space time and it turns out that bending space puts a strain on the quantum ether if this strain changes with time you get friction leonard parker discovered in the late 1960s that an expanding or contracting universe would create particles out of a pure vacuum in effect the stretching of space jiggles up some of the virtual particles and turns them into real particles
1798060 rotation of a superfluid is not uniform but takes place via a lattice of quantized vortices
1798061 this is a major hardware milestone for our company it marks the first time that we have simultaneously fired two engines on the same stage
1798062 theres a big difference when you have one engine and nine engines
1798063 the fuel and the oxidiser tanks have to be able to drain essentially nine times faster you need to flow all of those liquids down to those engines delivering them as needed so the plumbing there is very elaborate
1798064 long term thats one of the key factors that is allowing us to bring down the cost of space access
1798065 its one of those ideas that actually has a remote chance of making it off the drawing board
1798066 well be seeking funding for a balloon borne coronagraph this year
1798067 if we come up with a good design maybe well have a chance at this
1798068 encourage support and stimulate the development of a commercial market for space transportation from which nasa could potentially acquire orbital transportation services
1798069 were on track to award an additional partnership later in the month
1798070 the solid rocket booster was not designed to lift this kind of load or to have something stacked on top of it
1798071 we looked at a similar system and its true that it would be cheaper for going to the moon
1798072 but its expensive to use these big rockets to go to the space station
1798073 all were asking is for an independent apples to apples comparison of the two plans
1798074 we need to actually field a system not engage in more paper studies and reviews
1798075 at this point i am not seeing any significant interest in this direct alternative within the halls of congress
1798076 probably somewhere beyond the fifty years that it will take for us to return and colonize the moon
1798077 we are very happy that this competition inspired innovative designs to solve an important problem that could affect life on earth as the dinosaurs learned the hard way
1798078 we hope the winning entries will catalyse the worlds space agencies to move ahead with designs and missions to protect earth from potentially dangerous asteroids and comets
1798079 we are eager to make it return with our best efforts but the situation is not optimistic
1798080 its a credit to the japanese that theyve had some work arounds its the little spacecraft that could
1798081 it seems to be what we call a rubble pile an object that was blasted apart and is held together by not much more than its own gravity
1798082 its one of the first really good pieces of news for high energy astronomy in a while
1798083 i think were really turning some heads with this budget
1798084 were really looking forward to executing this exciting programme if congress will approve it
1798085 our focus has been how can we use that to buy commercially and buy domestically if possible
1798086 well make decisions each day as to whether were going to proceed or not
1798087 weve been very clear about why the president made this decision
1798088 this is about reducing risk to human life on earth
1798089 we achieved far more than we expected in a very short time
1798090 the moon regolith is not like sand its more like compressed talcum powder
1798091 theres certainly a lot of things you could do if you poke things into the ground
1798092 i think its a testament to nasas commitment to stimulating the commercial space market and the capability were hoping to enjoy in the future
1798093 europe is now a full participant in the space station
1798094 together with the arrival of the columbus module at the iss earlier this year the success of the atv marks the arrival of europe as a full fledged space power
1798095 the universe evolves extremely rapidly at these early times so a time difference like this makes a huge difference in the structure and size of galaxies that exist in those eras
1798096 were going to do something that has never been done in space
1798097 amazingly training in a neutral buoyancy lab in the spacesuit ive been able to do this
1798098 i still believe that hubble science and the hubble programme is still something worth risking my life for and i know i have six other crew members who believe that as well
1798099 it will not be able to support the growth of tomatoes
1798100 were learning how to cultivate cyanobacteria in the minimum conditions
1798101 sejam misericordiosos assim como o pai de voc s misericordioso
1798102 se algu m rico e v o seu irm o passando necessidade mas fecha o seu cora o para essa pessoa como pode afirmar que de fato ama a deus
1798103 e foram at jesus grandes multid es levando coxos aleijados cegos mudos e muitos outros doentes que eram colocados aos seus p s e ele curou todos
1798104 ent o os enviou para anunciarem o reino de deus e curarem os doentes quando jesus saiu do barco e viu aquela grande multid o ficou com muita pena deles e curou os doentes que estavam ali com isto todos saber o que voc s s o meus disc pulos se voc s se amarem uns aos outros
1798105 se algu m rico e v o seu irm o passando necessidade mas fecha o seu cora o para essa pessoa como pode afirmar que de fato ama a deus
1798106 meus filhinhos o nosso amor n o deve ser somente de palavras e de conversa deve ser um amor verdadeiro que se mostra por meio de a es
1798107 quando te vimos enfermo ou preso e fomos te visitar o rei responder digo lhes a verdade o que voc s fizeram a algum dos meus menores irm os a mim o fizeram
1798108 n o que possamos reivindicar qualquer coisa com base em nossos pr prios m ritos mas a nossa capacidade vem de deus
1798109 bitlocker differs from other disk encryption products mainly in the way that it protects the keys when the disk is not mounted
1798110 how much security do we need to sufficiently reduce our risk in laptop thefts across 10k laptops with the minimum amount of potential disruption so that i can get a little bit more sleep at night
1798111 a thief would need to be motivated technically skilled and have foreknowledge of valuable data presence to make the effort worthwhile
1798112 well only know for sure after its down to room temperature
1798113 but everything looks very very good its very unlikely that there will be a problem
1798114 theres quite a lot of testing there to make sure we get the curves right
1798115 the mirrors that we make now are way more difficult in testing than the hubble mirror
1798116 this weekend weve had more problems than weve had in the last six months we know what went wrong but not why
1798117 we know well be back again and well nail it next time
1798118 some of them just need a little more time and i would expect next year well have a real race on our hands
1798119 the biggest advantage is that you have no fuel that can run out
1798120 the magnetic coils work purely on electrical energy which you can generate through solar arrays that point at the sun
1798121 as a technologist i get extremely excited about seeing new technology advances so i welcome any type of breakthrough ideas
1798122 it just steps right off and carries the payload anywhere you want
1798123 if we get into ankle deep dust well lock the wheels use them as feet and just tiptoe out effectively
1798124 we proposed basically pole to pole exploration where youd land at one pole and explore sites down through the equatorial region and end up at the other pole
1798125 were working on designs for wheel drives and so on motors bearings gears that have 10 000 kilometres of life
1798126 what we have found as we go along the way is that this is a very manageable issue
1798127 if you push your child at just the right frequency you can really get them going high
1798128 at those limits theyre able to read the console to flip switches to write to do anything that they need to be doing
1798129 considerable unknowns as to whether nasas plans for these vehicles can be executed within schedule goals
1798130 usage note it is widely asserted that none is equivalent to no one and hence requires a singular verb and singular pronoun none of the prisoners was given his soup
1798131 just in case the anomaly is in the box itself
1798132 it was supposed to make it to orbit and it did not
1798133 we have a boat out trying to recover it but we havent found it at this stage
1798134 they started from scratch they had no legacy hardware or anything else
1798135 its regrettable but theyve hit the same wall which everyone hits which is that you cant test a throw away vehicle
1798136 the crew on board the iss seem to be happy with its performance and at ground control were quietly confident that everything will go according to plan
1798137 you can never know beforehand how the sensors will behave in space but they performed exactly as we had hoped
1798138 last year we practised relaying commands from nasa to mars express and then down to the surface using nasas mars rovers as stand in for phoenix
1798139 we have been precisely managing the trajectory to position odyssey overhead when phoenix arrives to ensure we are ready for communications
1798140 without those adjustments we would be almost exactly on the opposite side of the planet when phoenix arrives
1798141 by this technique we are no longer restricted by how much a rocket can carry
1798142 the surface of the entire mirror has to be formed and held to an accuracy of a fraction of a wavelength of light which is mighty accurate
1798143 in no conceivable way could this be cheap its not cheap to do this on the earth
1798144 it is an environment where you can do the best astronomy
1798145 the moon does not have an atmosphere and therefore we can see the sky very clearly at optical wavelengths
1798146 in addition to that the back side of the moon that never sees the earth is an ideal place to do radio astronomy because there you dont have manmade radio interference
1798147 theyre going to have to sit down and see what other options for cuts within the mars programme are viable
1798148 there was an 800 million investment just to get them to the planet
1798149 we now can operate both full blast for 20 million a year i feel that the amount of science that were getting from these vehicles easily justifies the amount being spent
1798150 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
1798151 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act
1798152 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
1798153 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case
1798154 law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of e mails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
1798155 were hoping to be in commercial operations by the end of 2010
1798156 im not going to let people get out of their seats right off the bat
1798157 this is a challenge because the atv must rendezvous with the space station and the two vehicles will be travelling at 28 000 kilometres an hour
1798158 the link up must be made with extreme precision we must get this technology absolutely right if we are to go further to the moon or mars
1798159 i hope that the atvs will be able to supply the station when the shuttle will no longer be in service
1798160 the more astronauts aboard the station the more supplies it will need
1798161 at present of the current uranium demand of 67 kt yr only 42 kt yr are supplied by new production the rest of about 25 kt yr is drawn from stockpiles which were accumulated before 1980
1798162 creo que nos encontramos ante una nueva realidad las familias a n quieren comer fuera de casa pero claramente tienen menos dinero en sus bolsillos
1798163 this interceptor is really intended for missiles travelling at 3 to 4 kilometres per second the satellite theyre going to be shooting at has a speed of 7 to 8 kilometres per second
1798164 has never wanted to explicitly say the missile defense system has an anti satellite capability so theyre dancing to say that we had to modify the system
1798165 do they understand this well enough to quantify the risk to the space station
1798166 for the purpose of prosecuting him on account of his nationality or political opinions
1798167 mr mckinnon is charged with the biggest military computer hack of all time
1798168 shes just trying to get things out to get things settled in her mind
1798169 aicar signals the cell that it has burned off energy and needs to generate more it is pretty much pharmacological exercise

1798176 all of these results will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1798177 we want to find out the truth and facts relevant to the history of these kings
1798178 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the lineage of pharaohs
1798179 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
1798180 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
1798181 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
1798182 the er has become the front door to the hospital
1798183 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
1798184 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
1798185 americans are ready for a change and his unifying message of freedom peace and prosperity is bringing more people together every day
1798186 thats great what do you want to do after that
1798187 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it

1798191 nasa has a limited amount of money to invest in
1798192 lets make certain every dollar is put to best use
1798193 we are now at the point where were able to consider reinvesting this money
1798194 ive had some discussions with some of the traditional aerospace firms and they do express an interest
1798195 we recognised we may need to turn to our international partners especially in the near term
1798196 it was important we had the ability to re supply the international space station in the early years or else certainly there would be no space station to re supply in the later years
1798197 intense pressure from further declines in crude oil and an additional gain in the u s dollar prevented the precious metal from regaining its composure
1798198 when do you know when its time to let something go
1798199 if you have been waiting for a change for 10 of the time youve been together 20 if you have kids then you should split
1798200 im afraid that i will regret it if i did is that a sign that im not really done yet

1798205 ultimately i believe that a deal is a deal i received what i bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well
1798206 although i approved the settlements i did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them

1798227 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1798228 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1798229 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1798230 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1798231 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1798232 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1798233 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1798234 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1798235 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1798236 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1798237 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1798238 iowa minnesota wisconsin and perhaps indiana are very important states mccain is behind and hes in danger of falling further behind

1798241 erp is not popular we know that but singaporeans understand that if you want smooth flowing roads and a certain amount of car growth then there has to be some form of trade off
1798242 of all the different measures to deal with congestion erp is the only one that deals directly with the problem by requiring individuals to take into account the costs of congestion caused by their driving to others
1798243 ive been on the roads for more than 10 years and every time there are erp price hikes they would only work for a short while then the congestion would come back again as people get used to the price
1798244 but i think motorists or the general public are looking at whether we have a more comprehensive integrated and overall solution
1798245 it will be too naive to expect that once you increase the price at this particular area the overall traffic congestion will come down we cannot just expect car owners to give up driving and switch to public transportation
1798246 our limited land resources have to be shared with other critical uses such as building homes for our people industries to drive our economy and schools for our children

1798262 a first job often sets the tone for a young persons perception of work and presents a wonderful opportunity for parents to teach kids that work does not have to be drudgery
1798263 instead doing your best at something often feels good and can bring personal and financial rewards
1798264 most young kids have chores but once you have a job theres a completely different dynamic
1798265 the earlier you are introduced to a work environment where you actually have superiors and have to take orders from someone regardless of how ridiculous they may be the earlier you accept it and learn to do well
1798266 younger kids can be extremely enthusiastic about a job when it is new but lose interest over time

1798295 there are many reasons for wanting to eat local foods
1798296 some like the pleasure of eating freshly harvested food while others like knowing where the product came from

1798299 c amp g technologies is a home grown indiana company and a prime example of an entrepreneurial life sciences business that is investing in indiana and creating jobs for hard working hoosiers
1798300 this is a high tech industry where people are counting on our equipment for critical diagnoses
1798301 with a staff of highly trained engineers a comprehensive parts stock fully equipped board repair department x ray tube processing station and even a clean room for high level detector repairs we have established a self efficiency and know that people count on this equipment with their lives it is up to us to make sure it works the way it was intended to for patients
1798302 what excites me most about the expansion at c amp g technologies is that this company is the product of vision eighteen years ago greg kramer acted on his vision of success and now he and his family run a company that will provide nearly 70 people with family wage jobs that are part of a growing high tech economy

1798310 bringing our market back to balance involves a two step process supply needs to draw down demand needs to bounce back up its as simple as that so far 2008 is proving to be the year that we can confidently check the first item off this list as the number of homes for sale continues to dwindle relative to one year ago there are currently 33 219 homes for sale in the twin cities region down a hearty 4 9 percent from one year ago a year over year figure which should continue to drop in the months ahead new listings for the week ending june 7 were down 13 9 percent from a year ago while pending sales declined by a smaller 5 3 percent for the same time period comparison all in all were halfway there supply is coming down but demand is only flattening not coming back up just yet regardless the signs are encouraging

1798312 business as usual will not deliver the infrastructure that pennsylvania needs to meet the transportation needs of the 21st century economy pennsylvania policymakers need to embrace a new paradigm for highway funding and operation
1798313 like most other rapidly growing states the georgia department of transportation finds itself barely able to pay for repairs and maintenance on existing roadways let alone build new ones federal and state gas taxes have not kept pace with either inflation or miles driven as drivers give up gas guzzlers for smaller cars and hybrids the gallons of fuel sold declines and therefore so does the highway revenue used to fund road and transit projects this dismal set of facts confronts all fast growing states so georgia should look closely what california florida texas and virginia are using tolling and public private partnerships in the 20th century tolling was simply a way to pay for a new bridge or roadway but 21st century tolling is different first its all electronic with no costly inconvenient toll booths second with variable pricing that adjusts to guarantee traffic is always moving freely at the speed limit it becomes a powerful tool for reducing congestion a large scale program to tackle atlantas congestion via 21st century tolling would produce a trifecta of benefits first it would pay for billions of dollars worth of new road capacity that would otherwise be unaffordable i e never built second variable pricing would keep the new lanes free flowing even at rush hours and third the new lanes would provide an uncongested guideway for region wide bus rapid transit service fast reliable express buses would be a new commuting alternative throughout the metro area possibly luring people out of their cars what specific tolled improvements should atlanta add one clear priority is a network of high occupancy toll hot lanes across whole freeway system some of these would be created by converting existing carpool lanes into toll lanes the rest would require adding new lanes in places where it is too costly to widen the freeway elevated hot lanes like those on tampas east west expressway would make sense another big project is the proposed downtown tunnel to relieve the hugely congested downtown connector i 75 85 a 2006 reason foundation study proposed this tunnel as an extension of the georgia 400 southward eventually all the way to i 675 but initially as far south as i 20 a double deck design for cars and buses only inspired by the nearly completed french tunnel under historic versailles would provide three lanes in each direction and cost about 5 billion in 2005 dollars other worthy projects are a limited set of truck only tollways to entice big rigs off the congested freeways by offering them large time savings in exchange for tolls and selected new tollways in atlantas fast growing suburbs outside the perimeter maryland is building such a toll road the intercounty connector to link i 95 with i 270 outside the washington d c capitol beltway area public private partnerships can be used to pay for these projects

1798352 it means that right when you thought you were out of the woods you are not
1798353 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
1798354 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme
1798355 that was probably the most important step internally as well as externally to say we screwed up
1798356 in their postevent examination they identified that there was at least some problems with former leadership at mobileme
1798357 eddy has shown with itunes over the years that hes very good at running a 24 7 worldwide distribution point hes got some serious chops and the appointment is interesting
1798358 i think apple may have to consider broadly beta testing with services in the cloud like mobileme
1798359 for apple both strategically and tactically a lot of the sizzle would get shown in a beta
1798360 that would take a certain tool out of their kit their ability to maintain secrecy around a product launch

1798386 there is plenty of space between the letters which makes all the difference in the world especially if you are viewing it at an angle people are viewing these signs not just from the straight on camera angle

1798394 i get extremely concerned for an agent or a prosecutor when someone says find out where he lives find out where his family goes to school at that point youve crossed the line
1798395 theres no telling what they might do with that kind of encouragement
1798396 people get heated up it is certainly a veiled threat
1798397 i dont know the details of the case i just know that a grave injustice is being done
1798398 has been using the eastern district of virginia to mete out his own brand of justice for muslim terrorism subjects often openly displaying his personal animus this long and controversial record forms the backdrop for the allegation of selective and malicious prosecution in this case

1798431 in it we had improved our reliability and our ability to develop new applications but there was still a disconnect between the capability of the systems and their impact on operational effectiveness
1798432 so our ceo made the decision to integrate it with operations and he made me accountable for the whole thing his thinking was that we could accelerate change and improve processes more quickly with a team that is focused on an integrated set of objectives
1798433 when we merged it and operations we looked across all of the sites and found the five or six best practices on turnaround time and defect reduction and built an applications road map across all of the regions we then held the gms accountable for the new standards
1798434 having an integrated approach and control over so many levers put our process improvement on steroids
1798435 as cio you are responsible for a significant spend in it if you can build a process for engaging the company in how most strategically to spend that money and how to bring a return on that investment suddenly the discussion moves away from mainframes and infrastructure and you become a leader in driving operational improvements
1798436 if you build a successful governance process you have just worked your way up to the point of controlling a corporate investment that drives business value and revenue
1798437 it was unclear to our ceo whether our call center issues were due to systems problems or operational management so he wanted one executive to be accountable for both
1798438 once i moved into the new role i sat down with the vp of customer care and together we designed a call center strategy for redundancy and scale we sorted out our staffing issues and turned the corner on service levels
1798439 but i was reluctant to let go of the cio role were i to have hired a new cio it might have been clearer that it was not simply absorbing the call center but that we were integrating
1798440 you want to choose the areas where you can make a quick impact having had the initial call center success i felt i had the time to focus on other issues like reducing cost the call center bought me the time to tinker with the areas that i understood less
1798441 both it and our loan servicing operations are service organizations and both require a strong degree of process discipline and design
1798442 when so many of our customers experience us through our technology it is important to look closely at how both organizations can work together for a seamless customer experience
1798443 i have moved between business and it roles and deliberately made choices to broaden my experience
1798444 when i had some it consulting under my belt i went into business consulting when i took on the cio role at nellie mae i took on operations responsibilities as well
1798445 the great thing about it is that it gives you the opportunity to demonstrate that you can deliver on big broad complicated expensive projects
1798446 in addition to the particular students who did not receive visas for technical reasons or unexplained security reasons there are hundreds of students in the gaza strip who were accepted by universities abroad and have valid visas
1798447 israel issues a comprehensive ban on students from gaza going abroad as part of its policy of collective punishment toward gaza residents thereby impinging on the right to education of hundreds of talented young people who want to study develop and create a better future in our region
1798448 and the birds of the air and they will tell you
1798449 and do not be afraid of their threats nor be troubled

1798458 outlining policies he would implement in the white house and the available resources dedicated to assisting military families in virginia she plans on introducing similar state oriented military family resource guides to the areas she visits in the future
1798459 if theres one thing ive learned from these roundtables its that when our military goes to war or deploys at sea their families go with them they become everything at home while their spouse is away theyre mom theyre dad theyre the disciplinarian theyre making dinner and doing homework and when the bills keep piling up and that list of chores seems endless they find themselves with yet another job worrying late into the night
1798460 i hear these stories everywhere i go from women doing everything thats asked of them and more ive heard from mothers struggling to make ends meet because their salaries arent keeping up with the cost of groceries but if they take a second job they cant afford the additional cost of childcare and they dont just struggle with the economic downturn like everyone else its often more difficult for you to find jobs and i am amazed at how military spouses do it all
1798461 if barack has the distinct honor of serving as your president and i have the privilege of serving as your first lady im going to keep taking your stories to him
1798462 well its not every day im introduced by a three star general thank you claudia kennedy for those generous words we are all so grateful for your service
1798463 and im joined up here by a true american hero medal of honor winner and my friend bud bucha hes been advising my husband and hell be actively participating in our discussion today
1798464 im so glad to be here in norfolk i knew it was big i knew hundreds of thousands of military personnel and family lived and worked here but i wasnt prepared for just how big it is it goes on forever
1798465 i wanted to come here because one of the things ive enjoyed and found so important over the course of this campaign is traveling from city to city and holding these roundtables with women sharing our stories and listening to their concerns
1798466 im humbled to be joined up here by six remarkable military spouses some of whom served as well
1798467 im honored to be here with all of you we are so grateful barack and i and all americans for the sacrifices you make as you serve this country that has given us so much
1798468 in my life i know ive been blessed by all ive been given
1798469 and thats why weve tried to serve people the best ways we can early in my career i left my job as an attorney because i wanted to give back to my community to ensure that people like my father received the opportunities they deserved and young people enjoyed the same opportunities i did
1798470 that same desire to give back led barack to enter public service more than two decades ago to turn down more lucrative jobs so he could work for a group of churches on the south side of chicago to give job training to the jobless and hope to the hopeless after local steel plants closed down and jobs dried up
1798471 but few sacrifice more to serve their country than you and i know that too often it seems like youre doing it on your own ive heard stories all over this country of families trying to hold it together with insufficient support
1798472 ive heard from mothers struggling to make ends meet because their salaries arent keeping up with the cost of groceries
1798473 and i am amazed at how you do it you struggle with all this and more if theres one thing ive learned from these roundtables its that when our military goes to war or deploys at sea their families go with them
1798474 you become everything at home while your spouse is away
1798475 and you dont just struggle with the economic downturn like everyone else its often more difficult for you to find jobs
1798476 one spouse former military herself told me she gave up looking and went back to school to become a nurse but now faces staggering student loans and 500 in monthly child care costs others have children stuck on base waiting lists or face rules that dont allow them to use on base child care
1798477 one woman told me for better or for worse in sickness and in health but it is tough sometimes another said that during the day she puts on her pretty clothes and her bold face and holds her head high and holds the fort down but at night she lies in bed and cries
1798478 you end up taking care of each other on base from babysitting to delivering bad news but youre rarely trained or prepared for any of it
1798479 i hear these stories everywhere i go from women doing everything thats asked of them and more
1798480 my husband deeply understands that commitment and the commitment america must make to our military families because without that commitment he might not be here today
1798481 his grandfather enlisted after pearl harbor and went on to march in pattons army his grandmother worked on a bomber assembly line while he was gone and his mother was born at fort leavenworth
1798482 when his grandfather returned it was to a country that gave him the opportunity to go to college on the gi bill to buy his first home with a loan from the federal housing administration to move his family west all the way to hawaii where he and baracks grandmother helped raise him
1798483 and so barack is determined to see that america makes the same commitment to todays military families that it made to his grandfathers generation
1798484 thats why when he arrived in the senate he sought out a seat on the veterans affairs committee so he could fight to serve our returning heroes as well as they have served us
1798485 baracks plan will ensure predictable deployments so that units have proper time to retrain and re equip and families have time to reconnect
1798486 hell expand the vet centers that provide critical services like counseling mental health care and employment assistance
1798487 and when our loved ones return home we will offer them the same opportunity baracks grandparents had under the gi bill the guarantee of a real chance to afford a college education
1798488 after all thats the very idea thats at the core of my husbands campaign that we are all in this together
1798489 at one of these roundtables a woman talked of her struggles to make it all work
1798490 i dont know her but when she leaves here she will have my phone number and she will be able to call me anytime shes got the support of this friend right here
1798491 that is the america we believe in thats the america we are working to restore
1798492 and if barack has the distinct honor of serving as your president and i have the privilege of serving as your first lady im going to keep taking your stories to him

1798543 come tutti sanno egli scriveva fin dalla costituzione dei vari partiti quello comunista incominci a basare il suo programma su tutto quanto gli stato conveniente per arrivare al suo scopo e dopo i primi risultati i capi comunisti incominciarono ad istigare il popolo verso i ricchi che per combattere questi il primo obbiettivo da colpire fu la mafia perch la mafia guarda spalle dei ricchi ostacola ampiamen te i contadini iniziarono la lotta ma prima non tanto apertamente perch i rappresentanti temevano le rappresaglie dei mafiosi ma in seguito subito dopo il primo impulso vedendo la mischina temerariet dei mafiosi ecco che quasi tutti i giorni sui giornali comunisti cominciarono ad affacciare discorsi infiammatori contro i ricchi e la mafia la lotta avanza apertamente e ad un certo punto la mafia viene considerata dai comunisti come uno stato dentro lo stato e la sua fantomatica organizzazione viene definita anche come il sostenimento dei banditi facendo finta di dimenticare che la maggior parte dei banditi sono stati vittime della guerra per le conseguenze che se ne risentono tuttora
1798544 bleffonate comuniste che predicavano il paradiso di mosca promettendo senza nulla dare
1798545 continuare a lungo perch i comunisti piano piano trasformarono il loro programma propagandistico in aggressione politica
1798546 la forza invisibile dei mafiosi cos dei ricchi e certo pure del governo
1798547 categoricamente che potesse essere un risentimento scaturito dagli stessi contadini
1798548 quegli assassini politici traditori della loro stessa coscienza per arrivare al loro scopo di comando continuassero a trascinare un popolo al delitto morale facendone la sferza contro i loro stessi confratelli di classe e di sventura
1798549 leggendoci quale era la ragione della loro morte il capo bandito continuava la propria esposizione assumendo
1798550 faceva ancora buio poco dopo le prime luci del giorno avvolgevano il luccichio delle stelle
1798551 fare una sparatoria in forma intimidatoria allo scopo di sciogliere la festa ed evitare che i contadini ricevessero altro veleno dalla propaganda comunista
1798552 sciupare tre caricatori e sparare pi o meno a venti metri al di sopra della massa in modo che questa sentendo fischiare le pallottole la consideravano una cosa seria
1798553 a qualcuno ci dovette tremare la mano o non seppi regolarsi bene

1798555 cui piace fare il gioco dello schiavismo della bassa plebe
1798556 a me non interessa scriveva al difensore se verr condannato per mille anni ma bens che i miei sentimenti sono stati precisi nel giudicare le mie stesse azioni e se ho agito ho agito sotto limpulso della ingiustizia sociale quindi la sua difesa la deve basare nel dire che il denunciare ci che fino ad ora non era stato conosciuto un senso di correttezza e di sincerit presso la giustizia
1798557 oltre ancora il suo programma difensivo deve essere basato sul lato politico da parte loro dei caporioni comunisti perch proprio per questa ragione succedette la mia reazione
1798558 questo deve essere il perno della sua difesa il dimostrare che se noi sparavamo direttamente alla folla con dieci minuti di fuoco che abbiamo fatto i morti non dovevano essere 11 ma centinaia
1798559 le persone cui siamo andate col eravamo dodici quindi l da domandargli come ci sono trenta imputati di questo fatto lei ne pu avere conferma mediante la loro stessa denunzia i primi rapporti dei cc e della questura nei quali si parla di 12 banditi perch ci sono tre testimoni che ci hanno visti e quindi hanno saputo quanto eravamo di numero con questo fatto lei pu dimostrare che tutti questi ragazzi sono innocenti e se si sono resi responsabili lo stato per le torture cui sono stati posti se domanderanno a questi ragazzi dove si trova piano della ginestra non lo sapranno rispondere
1798560 a viva voce onde farlo sentire a tutto il pubblico
1798561 potuto rilevare una presa di posizione contraria sia da parte dei magistrati che della stampa
1798562 la forza di reclutare tanta gente o meglio ragazzi che non conosceva
1798563 tutta quella fiducia e riconoscenza di grandezza e prendere consigli da loro e svelargli un simile grave fatto
1798564 fossero coinvolti persone di stato la piega del processo risulterebbe diversa
1798565 sarebbe stata accreditata avrebbe potuto indurlo a profittare delloccasione per vendicarsi

1798752 the fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act

1798793 its a great mission and were really filling a hole
1798794 the fact somalia is struggling through civil war and never really regenerated out of the 90s means it doesnt have a navy it doesnt have a seaborne police force of any consequence that it can use to stop this piracy

1798796 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1798797 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully

1798801 as the olympic games come closer and closer china is continuing to use the games as a platform to legitimize their olympic occupation
1798802 the situation in tibet has not improved since china was awarded the olympics the situation in tibet has actually dramatically worsened
1798803 i think the olympics were politicized from the very beginning when the chinese government and the international olympic committee promised the world that human rights would improve inside china
1798804 all were doing is trying to tell the truth and use the olympic spotlight to shine it on the situation inside tibet
1798805 our job is to ensure that while individual rights are protected and respected we reach the most peaceful ending to any situation that were faced with
1798806 we have always been open to having a meeting with the embassy
1798807 as canada prepares to host the 2010 winter olympics we must remind everyone that hosting the olympic games is not only a privilege it is a responsibility

1798809 the cirque is not sold and i am still the captain of the boat

1798813 when a child can simply be handed from one legal guardian to another with little or no scrutiny of the new guardians background there is a problem here
1798814 child welfare has whats thought to be a pretty strict screening process
1798815 any time a child dies under these circumstances we as a community as a society have something to learn
1798816 the tragic death of katelynn points to flaws in our child protection system

1798828 were trying to get it back to sounding like the record
1798829 even the songs that weve been playing its relearning those
1798830 im looking forward to a whole tour of not having to make any set lists
1798831 i have such a huge catalogue now that i dont get to play a lot of the songs
1798832 and i miss a lot of them we only have so much room in the set i loved the idea because it kind of satisfied my need to get all those songs out again

1798834 the bank of canada has come out just in the past week and announced that inflation is going to be at four per cent which puts the canadian military in the hole by 2 5 per cent
1798835 we have men and women in harms way and the government is trying to do this on the cheap
1798836 if thats how they feel they shouldnt put our kids in harms way they should simply stay at home
1798837 weve put forward an unprecedented commitment both financial and moral for the canadian forces
1798838 liberal senator colin kennys report is both disingenuous and inflammatory
1798839 in the end the government has to be a position to sign the cheques for capabilities and their ability to do this over the longer term is difficult to predict

1798855 another child was supposed to bring a toy pistol and he told a detective he didnt bring it because he thought he would get in trouble
1798856 were not sure at this point in the investigation how many of the students actually knew the intent was to hurt the teacher
1798857 but because they are kids they may have thought this was like a cartoon we do whatever and then she stands up and shes ok thats a hard call
1798858 from what i understand they were considered pretty good kids
1798859 but we have to take this seriously whether they were serious or not about carrying this through and thats what we did

1798862 one case study illustrates how marketers can help physicians improve their communication by videotaping primary care physicians who were struggling to assess migraine prevention candidacy with their migraine patients
1798863 although the research is billed as a way that pharmaceutical companies can help improve physician patient communications by helping physicians and patients speak the same language it obviously may be more useful to commonhealths pharma clients who can demonstrate value to physicians beyond just the benefit of the brand potentially creating an unexpected yet mutually beneficial relationship
1798864 challenge many of the assumptions of both academic and public policy critics of dtc
1798865 an exhaustive analysis of 440 transcripts of actual provider patient interactions in community practice settings the transcripts were all recorded between 2001 and 2005 and examined the nature of patient medication requests references to dtc in the dialogue and the overall nature of the risk benefit discussion in three therapeutic categories
1798866 patient initiated prescription drug requests are not driven by dtc advertising
1798867 dtc advertising does not harm the balance of discussions assessing the risks and benefits of a given medication regardless of dtc spending in the given category
1798868 dtc does not have the negative impact on the actual dialogue that many people allege
1798869 these facts will disappoint some who wish to restrict or ban dtc
1798870 others who wish to improve dtc will be both better informed and challenged as they seek to better educate patients and improve the doctor patient discussions that drive patient compliance with their healthcare regimens
1798871 raw data multiple tables and detail about methodology that a supposedly data driven agency like the fda demands in medical research
1798872 here we can see that there were 585 mentions of a brand name drug either by the doctor or the patient during the 440 visits recorded true the doctor initiated the discussion in the vast majority of cases 455 or 78 percent of the mentions yet the patient mentioned a brand name drug first in 130 cases or 22 percent of the mentions thats a far greater percentage than

1798899 while these data suggest the development of more favourable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century they also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted
1798900 so now you have the wrong people being punished the wrong sanctions and the opportunity of misuse of the system if a police officer had pulled over the driver speeding that driver would have gotten the ticket
1798901 lawyers like us are going to go to court and challenge them

1798910 reinventing the melting pot the new immigrants and what it means to be american
1798911 of course however hard they work many poor ill educated immigrants who start at the bottom of the ladder remain there throughout their lives
1798912 this is not particularly surprising and it may seem to vindicate those who claim that the united states today is importing a new lower class
1798913 but thats part of the point of our immigration policy america no longer has this kind of working class and it turns out that we need one
1798914 whos going to be telling their representative how to vote on this the people who have a real stake in it and thats small and mid sized business
1798915 le cur de la cath drale pr che contre la messe tridentine
1798916 allow me this morning to give not a homily but to enlighten you in regards to a request that was made by a group of people in the diocese
1798917 those who signed the request do not respect authority because they continue to desire the tridentine mass
1798918 it is the bishop who is responsible for pastoral activity and for the liturgy in his diocese
1798919 the pope is not the universal bishop he is the bishop of rome and bishop rivest is not the vicar of the pope he is the bishop of chicoutimi
1798920 our bishop would surely not like me to say such things because he is a good man
1798921 most people who are attached to tradition are insecure and incapable of adapting to the modern world
1798922 most of those who made the request for the forma extraordinaria are between 20 and 30 years old thus they are people who do not know latin and who seemingly do not know the tridentine liturgy
1798923 the tridentine mass is not all that traditional after all since before the council of trent there existed other forms of celebration and the manner in which the apostles celebrated holy mass is totally unknown to us
1798924 if i asked you to raised your hand those who desire it the tlm i am not sure that there would be many of you with your hand raised
1798925 you know im 65 years old and i never celebrated the mass of st pius v

1798929 the popes power of primacy over all both pastors and faithful remains whole and intact in virtue of his office that is as vicar of christ and pastor of the whole church the roman pontiff has full supreme and universal power over the church and he is always free to exercise this power
1798930 the canonical mission of bishops or directly through the successor of peter himself and if the latter refuses or denies apostolic communion such bishops cannot assume any office
1798931 i would much prefer to serve 100 angry americans than 4 happy quebecers
1798932 dont you know that that basilica is called st john how can the transfiguration of the lord be the titular feast
1798933 this is my beloved son with whom i am well pleased listen to him
1798934 his face did shine as the sun and his garments became white as snow
1798935 we have beheld his glory glory as of the only son from the father
1798936 in this mystery of the transfiguration gods providence has laid a solid foundation for the hope of the church so that the whole body of christ may know what a transformation will be granted to it and that the members may be assured that they will be sharers in the glory which shone forth in their head
1798937 descend the mount o peter you wanted to rest on the mountain come down
1798938 go down to toil on earth to serve on earth to be scorned and crucified on earth life goes down to be killed bread goes down to suffer hunger the way goes down to be exhausted on his journey the spring goes down to suffer thirst and you refuse to suffer

1798946 i got a kick out of seeing him compete last year
1798947 he learned a lot in his first four games and by washington state we started seeing what type of player he can become were looking for more games like byu
1798948 you look at the national champions the last few years and one thing they had in common was a great front four
1798949 the ability to create pressure get penetration without calling a blitz is crucial when you limit the vision of the quarterback and limit the time he has to make an accurate throw and stop the run with your front seven youre going to be good football team
1798950 i was teasing those guys the other day that i put their names in the hat pulled them out and hale was elected for the first shot
1798951 some of us did not think the setting of a deadline was practical but now that the deadline had been passed without any major breakthroughs it means this could drag on for much longer
1798952 negotiations are about making compromises but it is obvious here that this thing is now beyond the control of the people of zimbabwe who have to do nothing but watch as politicians fail to put the people first
1798953 we were looking forward to the talks to bring about something for us it means our hardships are set to continue
1798954 we are in dire straits and what we want is not a political solution to our crisis but an economic solution they can keep talking but for us the economy must take first priority
1798955 obviously the two mdcs firmly believed they had an upper hand and leeway in that mugabe had agreed to the talks
1798956 but with people like chinamasa at the table this impasse was to be expected
1798957 i hate feeling helpless but there is nothing i can do but wait for these people political leaders to decide our fate
1798958 this country used to be paradise but as long as these politicians keep thinking about themselves there will be no country to speak of
1798959 i could have done more had i sold this how many more could i have afforded to save
1798960 the last time i was there it smelled of death
1798961 were hoping to lower the barrier to participation by providing a forum for surfacing sharing and collaborating on new ideas and concepts our goal is to bring even more people to the table and provoke thought facilitate discussion and inspire future design directions for firefox the mozilla project and the web as a whole

1798967 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
1798968 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
1798969 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
1798970 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
1798971 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
1798972 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
1798973 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
1798974 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
1798975 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again
1798976 the courts run by the government are active around the country

1798997 the disgraceful events that occurred at the funeral of dinko aki in zagreb insult the memory of all the victims of the ustasha regime and besmirch the republic of croatias good name
1798998 im convinced that the majority of the croatian people are shocked by the way the funeral of the jasenovac commander and murderer dressed in an ustasha uniform was conducted
1798999 at the same time i strongly condemn the inappropriate words of the priest who served at the funeral and said that sakic was a model for all croats

1799090 unless tsvangirai has real executive power then the whole thing will break down almost immediately
1799091 there is no mechanism for this transition to be policed so who will tsvangirai appeal to if zanu pf break out of the deal once they have got their hands on some international finance
1799092 we will look at the deal if it reflects the will of the people as of march 29 then fine if not then nothing will change it is very shocking that people go and vote and then land up with a government of national unity which is not what they voted for
1799093 unless home affairs justice and the reserve bank are out of zanu pf hands there can be no deal that the people can trust the international community must be very careful zanu pf is only interested in the money in lifting of sanctions once that is done they might decide to do their old things then what happens
1799094 everything fell into place when we got together it felt like wed known each other for ever
1799095 its so strange how weve met again and fallen in love i cant imagine it happening to anyone else i feel so lucky ive found dale
1799096 jane and i were talking about giving birth she told me how because dale was a very big baby she had a really awful delivery and ended up having to have a caesarean section
1799097 then she said giving birth to dale was like giving birth to a rugby player because he was 10 5 lbs
1799098 suddenly it just came flooding back that jane had been the lady next to me in hospital
1799099 we had talked then about how giving birth to a big baby was just as dangerous as giving birth to a small one
1799100 the thing i remember about jane was her letting her head flop back on the pillow because she was so exhausted
1799101 its amazing the way my memory just clicked into place when i realised jane was the same woman
1799102 the chances of them meeting again must be a million to one its just so peculiar but wonderful
1799103 stemmed from a momentary misunderstanding as to the exact location of the u s mexican border
1799104 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him

1799107 the faa does in all due respect an incredibly incomplete investigation

1799110 the goal is to try to get either the supreme court or the congress to get the policy changed at the national level

1799112 you have to adopt narrowly tailored measures to help you overcome that disparity

1799139 would starting to drill now do anything for consumers in the near future the answer to this one is probably not since itll take so long for new oil or gas to come to market

1799287 we were able to restore function in these animals not by dosing them with oestrogen but by enabling them to use the oestrogen that was naturally present in their bodies
1799288 we discovered that you can affect the oestrogen receptor directly in the hippocampus right where its needed to address memory and spatial learning
1799289 oestrogen may act as a growth agent for cancer but in the brain it appears to maintain health and counteract stress
1799290 we wanted to come back and enhance the signalling pathway that makes oestrogen functional we used a gene therapy technique that enables us to target the brain but ultimately there could be a pharmaceutical that enhances the signalling pathway solely in the brain
1799291 this research shows that when the oestrogen receptor alpha is restored to adult mice that have been missing it their entire lives it is still possible to enhance memory and learning
1799292 this is good news for moving forward to develop clinical interventions and therapeutics because it appears critical damage was not done to brain circuitry during early development there has also been debate about which of at least two oestrogen receptors is key to synaptic health clearly oestrogen receptor alpha plays a critically important role in hippocampal organisation and function
1799293 investigating the impact of genetically replacing the oestrogen receptor at the cellular synaptic and behavioural levels is a scientific tour de force which provides a strong foundation for the role of oestrogen receptor alpha in mediating oestrogen action in the hippocampus to restore select types of memory function
1799294 from a technology perspective their technique to transfect the oestrogen receptor is an exciting advance for researching steroid receptors in the brain
1799295 the research brings up the idea that local activation of non nuclear oestrogen receptor alpha is important for regulating memory processes in the hippocampus

1799299 this time we will fight decisively to achieve our ends
1799300 the nwfp government has deceived us by launching the military operation and we will avenge it for this it is following washingtons policies but we will continue to fight against united states both in pakistan and afghanistan
1799301 they are in the mountains and they are in the villages among the civilian population
1799302 the military is using gunship helicopters to flush them away but sometimes it kills more civilians than the taliban
1799303 it creates resentment among the local population and the government should consider this issue seriously
1799304 i fail to understand how you can sign peace with a group that is adamant on bringing destruction to the region and its people
1799305 we are virtually at the brink of a civil war

1799310 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
1799311 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence
1799312 there are many questions that the fbi and the pakistani government need to answer in light of this admission
1799313 aafia siddiqui is a woman who has been plagued by a number of problems in her life none of which have anything to do with involvement with al qaeda
1799314 whilst we welcome this disclosure from the fbi it has only come after mounting international pressure and five years of detention and abuse siddiquis case represents the problem of disappearances in pakistan in the most tragic way the acceptance by the fbi that siddiqui has been in custody in afghanistan raises important questions which must be answered by the pakistani and us governments siddiqui must be returned to pakistan in order to faces charges for any crime she may have committed or released along with her children
1799315 54 next generation 737 800 aircraft from boeing at the farnborough air show in england valued at 4 billion us at the same time dubai international airport reports record traffic for the first half of 2008 with 18 46 million passengers
1799316 this order by flydubai is valued at approximated 4bn at todays list prices and marks the biggest single order by a gulf based low cost carrier for the boeing aircraft the 737 800 is a single aisle aircraft configured with 189 economy class seats it has a flying range of 4 5 hours which will give flydubai access to an estimated 2 billion potential customers
1799317 our relationship with the uae is something we truly value and have worked to strengthen over time todays order is the result of a thorough analysis of the contributions the next generation 737 can make to flydubais innovative business model we foresee the unmatched efficiency and operability of this incredible airplane bringing the same success to our partners in dubai as it does to so many of the worlds most successful low cost carriers

1799329 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here i want to drill now i dont know where he was standing i think he was in a building somewhere this plan will not lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration

1799331 mccain represents four more years of oil companies calling the shots after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1799332 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1799333 you have to start with the recognition that most wells drilled in the rockies are not oil wells they are gas wells there would never be an expectation of huge returns on the oil side
1799334 weve turned our western lands into a pincushion and gasoline is 4 a gallon and the price of natural gas has gone through the roof
1799335 because we are a frontier region its heavier lifting to build the infrastructure to ship energy from where its produced to where its needed
1799336 if you restrict drilling youll go from a situation where were growing one billion cubic feet in production a day to a situation where youre flat or declining in two years
1799337 opening protected areas of the coasts or public lands to new leasing is not going to lower the price of gasoline
1799338 there is obviously in the rockies a tremendous amount of industry investment it is reasonable to expect that surge will bear fruit with new production over the coming decade
1799339 what these data show is that conservation and renewable energy are likely to be the solution to our energy woes
1799340 on the oil side the data show that theres just not that much oil out there in the west
1799341 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
1799342 e lementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice
1799343 a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed
1799344 the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct a law prohibits
1799345 that it is hereby made unlawful for any person willfully to make any unjust or unreasonable rate or charge in handling or dealing in or with any necessaries
1799346 complex medical judgment about which experts can and do disagree
1799347 should not admit of such a double meaning that the citizen may act upon the one conception of its requirements and the courts upon another
1799348 despite the broad discretion that states possess with respect to the imposition of criminal penalties and punitive damages the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution imposes substantive limits on that discretion
1799349 serve the same purposes as criminal penalties defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding
1799350 while the term recklessness is not self defining the common law has generally understood it in the sphere of civil liability as
1799351 where as here the statutory text and relevant court and agency guidance allow for more than one reasonable interpretation it would defy history and current thinking to treat a defendant who merely adopts one such interpretation as a knowing or reckless violator
1799352 authorities say that days before the 2001 anthrax attacks army scientist bruce ivins wrote an e mail warning that osama bin laden had anthrax and had declared war on the united states and israel postal inspectors say the language in e mails by scientist bruce ivins was similar to the words used in the anthrax letters that terrorized the nation in 2001

1799358 la tierra es un dep sito de posibilidades y hemos construido un mundo que ha olvidado la tierra
1799359 estamos m s tranquilos pero la desolaci n es total no ha habido p rdidas personales pero esto ya no va a ser castej n y la vista no ser la misma
1799360 yo he nacido aqu y cuando ven as esto era una alegr a verlo pero ahora a medida que ibas llegando te invade una desolaci n total
1799361 la gente ahora est m s tranquila aunque sigue un poco nerviosa porque mira el incendio c mo nos ha dejado el monte tan bonito como lo ten amos pero bueno el tiempo lo hace otra vez y como no ha habido personas heridas de ninguna clase pues contentos
1799362 est bamos en las piscinas y desde all no se oye la megafon a entonces cuando nos dimos cuenta el fuego estaba pr cticamente en las piscinas entonces empezamos a correr fue un momento dif cil la verdad
1799363 yo cuando me iba mir por el retrovisor y pens que cuando volviera ya no tendr a nada sent una tristeza y una desolaci n total porque ves que las cosas las pierdes en un momento
1799364 pasamos mucho miedo esta noche en el pueblo ha habido mucho miedo y terror no se ha dormido nada en castej n a las 3 de la ma ana yo estaba en la plaza y a las 6 fui otra vez para ver si hac a falta porque llamaban a gente

1799369 no es una elecci n cualquiera es una batalla entre el viejo orden corrupto y la nueva malasia sin razas ni discriminaci n y con equidad y justicia para todos sus ciudadanos
1799370 es posible que la contienda signifique un punto de inflexi n para que nuestra sociedad alcance equidad justicia y democracia
1799371 se espera que anwar obtenga un gran triunfo pero todos estar n atentos a la mayor a que obtenga porque eso indicar qu grado de aceptaci n tiene su programa entre los votantes
1799372 filosof a pol tica y de inclusi n social y cosmopolita
1799373 anwar es una persona ambiciosa dispuesta a entregar todo lo sagrado a los malayos con tal de convertirse en primer ministro
1799374 la acusaci n de sodom a seguramente ser un asunto clave en los comicios locales
1799375 anwar decidi hacer frente a la ciudadan a plantearles el asunto y dejar que la gente decida su culpabilidad o inocencia mediante el resultado electoral
1799376 debo convertirme en primer ministro para empezar a implementar reformas verdaderas que el pa s necesita con urgencia
1799377 la econom a est a la deriva y el mundo se r e de nosotros
1799378 me discriminan porque me atrevo a defender al pueblo y denunciar la corrupci n ven que cuestiono un sistema corrupto
1799379 la elecci n no se trata de una persona o una circunscripci n sino del futuro del pueblo malasio y de una naci n

1799383 si va all sin importar lo que diga el fiscal lo acusar de perjurio kromberg nos dej muy claro eso
1799384 si no testifica puede ser acusado de desacato y se fue el camino que mi padre eligi es una posici n de principios pues se opone al abuso de poder del gobierno
1799385 si pueden matarse entre s durante el ramad n pueden presentarse ante el gran jurado lo nico que no deben hacer es comer antes de la puesta de sol
1799386 no cancelar la presentaci n del doctor al arian ante el gran jurado ayudando a la islamizaci n de estados unidos
1799387 todo esto se origina en el comit de asuntos p blicos estados unidos israel
1799388 este muchacho simplemente se manifiesta de modo muy efectivo a favor de la causa palestina sa es la ra z de este problema y el gobierno intenta reprimirlo
1799389 la defensa pisa terreno firme al decir que ste es un caso de persecuci n pol tica

1799393 las leyes antiterroristas aprobadas en todo el mundo representan una amplia expansi n de los poderes gubernamentales para investigar detener juzgar y encarcelar a individuos con una m nima supervisi n judicial transparencia p blica y debido proceso
1799394 este argumento ha sido rechazado por varios tribunales de varios miembros de la onu y aun si uno solo aceptara ese argumento estar a bajo el imperio de los principios humanitarios internacionales
1799395 proceso lento y parcial para superar una muy profunda renuencia
1799396 miembros del consejo estaban muy firmes en la postura de que no se ten an que crear salvaguardas de derechos humanos como parte de su agenda antiterrorista y recuerdo muy v vidamente en ese periodo cuando un embajador de uno de los p5 cinco miembros permanentes china estados unidos francia gran breta a y rusia me dijo joanna no esperes ver juntas las palabras derechos humanos en ning n documento del consejo sobre terrorismo y debo decir que lo cumplieron durante mucho tiempo
1799397 it encapsulates why i started writing this blog why i stopped writing for several months and a larger malaise that seems to affect the academic blog community
1799398 well ok youve probably heard of bus rage but did you hear the one about the carny and the cannibal traveling together to manitoba
1799399 i am not aware that in all our joint researches we have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at every fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond and yet we have surely made some appreciable progress
1799400 el hecho de que incluso ignoren que se est planeando una uni n aduanera m s amplia demuestra que no han sido consultados
1799401 esto es as porque esas naciones no se benefician mucho con el arancel externo com n ya que la mayor a de las industrias a las que protege est n radicadas en sud frica el miembro dominante del bloque
1799402 beneficiar a los pa ses blns al permitirles diversificar las fuentes de sus importaciones actualmente la mayor parte proviene de sud frica a causa del r gimen arancelario de la sacu
1799403 tendremos acceso a un mercado m s amplio tambi n habr mayor competencia entre los productores de bienes y servicios lo que dar como resultado una mayor eficiencia y productividad
1799404 la sacu llev a la integraci n y coordinaci n del desarrollo econ mico de sus miembros aunque se verific una cierta polarizaci n a ra z de la cual las grandes empresas se han concentrado en sud frica
1799405 no s lo ayudaron fiscalmente a sus miembros sino que les otorgaron la posibilidad de desarrollarse econ micamente los l deres pol ticos de esos pa ses tienen la responsabilidad de usarlos con ese fin
1799406 deber n desarrollar las habilidades y conocimientos de su gente y hacer algo respecto de su capacidad productiva para sobrevivir a la competencia que se avecina
1799407 los productos sudafricanos son m s baratos que los locales en los pa ses blns por lo que han recurrido a las importaciones desde ese pa s para satisfacer sus necesidades dom sticas no pueden competir con ellos en el mercado interno a causa del precio y mucho menos exportarlos al socio dominante
1799408 en teor a la integraci n regional crear un mercado ampliado e incrementar las posibilidades de crecimiento econ mico y desarrollo sin embargo la realidad indica lo contrario el comercio entre los miembros de la sadc es actualmente muy escaso y se necesita un milagro para cambiar esta situaci n si no hay importantes cambios estructurales el potencial comercial de la regi n permanecer limitado
1799409 los naturales socios comerciales para los productores de bienes primarios son los pa ses ricos s lo sud frica y en menor grado zimbabwe pueden ofrecer adecuados productos industrializados no existe en la regi n oferta competitiva en numerosos rubros por ejemplo veh culos de motor por lo que la uni n europea seguir siendo la jefa en esta rea
1799410 la pol tica dura y de choque adoptada por el gobierno ha demostrado los l mites del poder de estados unidos
1799411 en una condici n de impotencia autoinfligida respecto de muchos problemas
1799412 y en parte por reg menes rabes amigables que buscan una salida a situaciones llevadas por estados unidos a un punto muerto
1799413 muchas naciones esencialmente amigas adoptan pol ticas que washington desaprueba present ndolas como hechos consumados y dej ndole la opci n de criticar lo hecho por sus llamados aliados o aceptarlo a rega adientes
1799414 estados unidos tiene poca influencia incluso sobre las pol ticas de los pa ses amigos

1799420 el estado no decide cu ntos atletas van viajan los que clasificaron ning n deportista que haya alcanzado las marcas se qued sin viajar
1799421 hay una tendencia que va mejorando pero por supuesto hay pa ses en la regi n como brasil cuba o venezuela donde el apoyo es mayor
1799422 sin ese apoyo las federaciones estar an en extinci n
1799423 la mayor parte del dinero para alto rendimiento se consume en d lares porque se va en pasajes y competencias internacionales por eso m s que un aumento hay una actualizaci n
1799424 hay una pol tica deportiva pero lo que no hay es voluntad pol tica de apoyar verdaderamente el deporte con planes de 100 o 200 millones de d lares y a cuatro u ocho a os
1799425 excepto en f tbol la mayor a de las federaciones son amateurs y eso significa que son manejadas por voluntarios que a veces tienen trayectoria en el deporte y a veces no pero que van a cumplir esa funci n despu s de su trabajo rentado y hacen lo que pueden en general sin mucha idoneidad
1799426 el deporte de hoy necesita marketing prensa y para eso hacen falta gerentes deportivos
1799427 en europa ganan por lo menos cinco veces m s que ac es l gico que quieran irse pero es una l stima porque se va el deportista que es espejo para los m s chicos y tambi n se van los entrenadores
1799428 el apoyo de la secretar a de deportes es pobre yo cobro 450 pesos por mes 150 d lares y tengo esposa y una hija el a o que viene voy a tener que empezar a jugar a nivel profesional
1799429 hay menos viajes y entonces menos oportunidad de que los boxeadores se fogueen
1799430 argentina tiene una enorme tradici n ol mpica en boxeo pero antes los atletas llegaban a las olimp adas con 26 a os y m s de 150 peleas en cambio ahora un joven de 18 a os que gan dos o tres peleas ya es tentado para iniciar una carrera profesional
1799431 nosotros tuvimos becado a un gran valor como marcos maidana que ahora va a pelear por un t tulo mundial pues los empresarios le ofrecieron un contrato profesional y ah encontr su futuro

1799440 i think its great that the audience would get to see her acting ability and get to see her pursue a career in hollywood so i came out to support her

1799471 assuming no dramatic change in economic trends we are planning for total sales growth in fiscal 2009 of 6 to 10 we expect comparable store sales growth of 1 to 5 and identical store sales growth of zero to 4
1799472 its cyclical in the sense as when the economy turns back up again and customers feel more financially secure we expect theyll probably return to previous purchasing patterns so well still have the value focus and we think that will position us better competitively for the long run but we do think customer purchasing patterns will evolve as the economy evolves
1799473 competition of course is a factor and as is cannibalization but they are not any more intense right now then they were in q2 or q1 so although we cant know for certain we think its reasonable to conclude that the deceleration in our comp store growth has primarily been due to the economy

1799575 it is important that this great nation opens itself to the gospel
1799576 its time to put away the arguments of political spin masters that only serve to justify abortion killing
1799577 we have all heard a great deal this year about the need for change
1799578 but at the same time we are told one thing cannot change namely the abortion regime of roe v wade it is time that we demand real change and real change means the end of roe v wade
1799579 its time to stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
1799580 this is kind of the touchstone for this whole election year id like catholics to think what real change fundamental change in a christian sense would mean

1799588 i believe it is simply due to microsofts weakness in its online services division you look at their last quarters numbers for that group and its clear that they are falling further behind their desktop business also showed deceleration yahoo helps with both problems
1799589 at this point given that we have plenty of money in the bank it makes a lot more sense not to distract ourselves with trying to put the finishing touches on a revenue plan

1799694 en aquellos tiempos los de primera eran las calles ju rez allende y corregidora y se distingu an por los muebles aqu en las orillas no ten amos de estos silloncitos eran sillones de madera entonces all hab a puros espejos m quinas el ctricas y aparte la gente los mejores clientes eran en el centro los de centavos la tarifa de nosotros era 90 centavos la rasurada y 1 20 el pelo ah en el centro se cobraban 2 50
1799695 uno tiene que buscar por el pelo c mo hacerle para que quede presentable c mo hacer que se vea bien el cliente casta as redondas casta as cuadradas abultado medio abultado los pachucos quer an abultado con media cola ya no los hago porque la gente ya no los pide nosotros no ten amos modelo el cliente dec a yo lo quiero as y nosotros sab amos c mo ve amos su tipo de pelo
1799696 bueno yo fui ch charo o sea aprend a trapear bolear limpiar espejos pues ah empieza uno a ver y se va uno ense ando luego el maestro ya le da a uno oportunidad de empezar a pelar a gente en aquel tiempo hab a unos que estaban medios tocados entonces eran nuestros maniqu s y ah empezaba uno a trabajar hasta que se hac a uno peluquero empec ya como oficial como a los 16 y ahorita tengo como 54 a os en esto
1799697 esas rayas tienen su significado el caramelo cuando a m me toc estar de aprendiz yo ya no lo vi pero el maistro nos dec a que los peluqueros anteriormente ten an sanguijuelas y se pegaban en las v rices para sacar la sangre y tambi n sacaban muelas entonces ese era el rojo que viene siendo la sangre el blanco significaba la limpieza porque ten a que tener puros peinadores blancos y bata blanca y el azul significa la confianza porque le tienen que tener confianza al peluquero porque imag nese con esa navaja entonces ese era el significado y adem s donde lo ve a uno ya sab a que ah era peluquer a
1799698 esto es lo que ya no le hacen a uno en una est tica no es lo mismo ni los servicios son los mismos hay mucha diferencia entre un estilista y un peluquero nosotros arreglamos barbas bigotes y los estilistas no creo que le entren incluso donde trabaj bamos nos daban 20 25 minutos por cliente ahora en 10 minutos ya ya est un estilista ya acaba ahorita ya no afilamos navajas porque nos dijeron que pura desechable por lo del sida pero antes ten a uno que afilar navajas sus tijeras ahora ya no creo que lo hagan

1799713 i guess youre not the female gryffindor prefect for your year
1799714 well i guess i didnt impress mcgonagall no big deal mum that just means i dont have to bother with all that patrolling and those meetings it also means neville and i can have some time alone together on the train while harry and hermione are in their first meeting
1799715 ron will probably be there with you and maybe maggie and ti
1799716 maybe i can get him to leave us for a while and visit dean and seamus
1799717 i just knew youd make prefect just like bill a and p percy
1799718 uh oh harry i guess were on our way there you better know what to tell him
1799719 why it looks like the badge for the gryffindor quidditch captain
1799720 you should be captain not me youve been on the team since first year
1799721 but im not as well versed in strategy as you are
1799722 the day before we left hogwarts last june mcgonagall and katie bell approached me to offer me the position katie said she wanted to concentrate on her n e w t s and didnt want to be like angelina was i thought about it for a few seconds then told them that youd make a much better captain since when it comes to strategy and quidditch youre the best weve got hell you beat just about everyone at chess and any of those muggle strategy type games
1799723 everyone in gryffindor knows your skill in strategy and knowledge in quidditch no one will object especially the rest of the team trust me on this ron please take the position
1799724 were in each others minds after all he just asked me to keep it quiet until you get the badge
1799725 well if thats the way you guys feel about it ill do it
1799726 youre welcome mate you just make sure we get the cup this year or mcgonagall might make me regret giving you the captaincy
1799727 i agree with harry and ginny youll do well as captain
1799728 i think youll give gryffindor the best chance to win the quidditch cup this year
1799729 though wed have a better chance if ginny and i are among the starting chasers
1799730 she said she just didnt want the hassle of the captaincy but didnt want to stop playing so what do you think we should do with the team
1799731 well i think we should do what angelina did last year and hold tryouts for all positions except keeper of course
1799732 i dont think theres anyone as good as you two and katie for chaser but i want to make sure we have the best so you guys have to try out again okay
1799733 that goes for the seeker position as well okay mate
1799734 well i think katies being sensible about her n e w t s
1799735 speaking of n e w t s how did fred and george do in theirs ginny
1799736 since they only had three o w l s each they had just that number of n e w t subjects which they passed
1799737 theyve been working on it in the afternoons after our training they managed to rent a building in diagon alley number 95 i think theyre calling the shop weasleys wizard wheezes what a weird name theyre opening this weekend just in time for the shopping rush before school starts
1799738 can we see it when we go to diagon alley for our school supplies mum
1799739 i suppose now that you have your letters we can go down there this weekend
1799740 i guess we better do it as soon as possible
1799741 ill talk to arthur frank and sirius so all the kids can go together im sure albus and i can arrange enough security i have to warn you kids though parts of the alley havent been completely repaired yet after the christmas attack
1799742 i told you not to do that to your sister
1799743 you shouldnt do that either come on you two lets clean you up
1799744 glad you could drop by oh benefactor of ours you can take anything you want with no charge
1799745 dont say another word harry thats how we want to pay you back for your help please accept it just tell everyone where you got them
1799746 now this area is where we have our more serious line it seems that there are a lot of ministry employees who arent capable of casting a good shield charm probably since they didnt have you or your dad teaching them
1799747 your dad asked us to develop some stuff to help with that weve come up with shield hats cloaks and gloves that can deflect minor to moderate charms hexes and jinx theyre of little use against an unforgivable unfortunately but quite useful nonetheless
1799748 if you want a diversion just drop one surreptitiously and itll run off and make a loud noise out of sight here have a few harry
1799749 well wed better take a look around the shop while we can i think they want to make this whole trip a quick one
1799750 you better get what you want mollys getting a bit antsy and wants to move on ill round up the rest of the group
1799751 dont worry theyve got a brilliant security system protecting their shop there are also wards around the shop to prevent any death munchers from getting in i checked it out its as safe as the burrow believe me
1799752 if you say so i just cant help but worry
1799753 i worry about neville and maggie being involved in all this i also worry about how they will cope if something happens to frank or me but then doing the right thing is never easy but it has to be done
1799754 i know youre right alice but still how can this shop be part of doing the right thing
1799755 with all the awful things voldieshorts and his death chewers are doing people need to be able to laugh and enjoy some things
1799756 well i think we should go to madam malkins next
1799757 its the closest and i think almost all the kids need new robes
1799758 lucius hasnt been home since draco came home from school its just draco and me at home
1799759 sam and i love ti like our own but i can tell that he misses you very much
1799760 i dont know sirius im not sure if draco will go with me
1799761 if you really want you can take him with you
1799762 you just have to make sure he wont try to contact his father
1799763 really sirius id like nothing more than to have both of my sons with me
1799764 i just need to talk to dumbledore and my wife about this ill try to owl you in a few days
1799765 he might have heard everything i dont think hell be happy to leave lucius it might not be a good idea now to bring him with you
1799766 i was talking with narcissa about leaving her death eater husband so she could be with her youngest son im not entirely sure about dracos allegiance so i think it best he doesnt know about his mothers plans i had to obliviate madam malkin to make sure no one else knew that cissy and ti met here its safer that way
1799767 look cissy im sorry for doing that to draco but at least this way he cant tell his father your plans until its too late for dear old lucius to stop you well sort it out with madam malkin you and draco go on back to malfoy manor
1799768 all right sirius i cant do anything about it now
1799769 stay safe my boy i hope to see you in a few days
1799770 ive done that a few times with no effect on the person i obliviated other than a bit of confusion after didnt you hear what i told your mother if draco tells your father that shes planning to leave him hell either lock her up with a couple of guards or kill her i dont think you want either option
1799771 you really think hell listen to you ti i dont know what nonsense hes been giving you for the past year but hes just as bad as your father i think hes going to end up just like him dead or in azkaban for life
1799772 i think i can convince him to side with us weve been doing just fine at school talking and eating and having fun together he even gave me this for my birthday
1799773 all right ti im sorry for doing that to draco
1799774 but at the time it was my only option i do hope your mother can bring draco over with her i know you miss him too even if he was a git to you all your life
1799775 come on we need to get you a new set of robes youve grown at least six inches since last summer
1799776 it belonged to my great grandmother amanda she was married to dads grandfather harrison potter i think they named me after him though they kept it simple with harry can you imagine it if i was named harrison james potter
1799777 its past noon the rest of your guests should be here soon wed better get back before they send a search party for us
1799778 though i believe his appearance here would be a gift to your whole family before i reveal him let me just say that this person has had a big change of heart after the attack on diagon alley he realized that his family was more important than any job he approached me and offered to help the order since he was in a position to spy on the activities of the former minister of magic he provided us with valuable information that enabled me to thwart several ill advised moves of fudge before he was voted out of office
1799779 hes sorry for all the hurt hes caused you and your family and wants to be accepted again
1799780 im sorry for not telling you earlier molly arthur but i retained percy as my secretary he asked me not to tell you until dumbledore thought it would be safe for him to rejoin his family you should be proud of him
1799781 just come you dont have to get anything just come
1799782 how should we live on the earth in order to restore and maintain ecological balance
1799783 its important potter we need to get you off the street its too dangerous here
1799784 again why danger safety does it matter does it matter if death eaters kill me tomorrow
1799785 of course it matters many people care we care youre important
1799786 i knew we should have pulled him out of that damned house sooner we left him there too long hes suffered so much and then the dementor attack i told you
1799787 dumbledore wanted him there and he knows best besides hes fifteen years old hes strong hell recover
1799788 besides right now we have to get him inside this is getting very dangerous
1799789 you look peckish im sure you need a good meal unfortunately we have a meeting about to start ill get you some food afterwards be a dear and run upstairs ron and hermione are waiting for you
1799790 dont you want to know whats been going on or why we havent written to you all summer
1799791 ronald he needs to talk he just doesnt understand that yet
1799792 i reckon ive never seen him quite like this before
1799793 it makes a difference to those who care about you
1799794 i didnt entirely realize what you were going through this year and i know the events at the end of the year have got to be hard
1799795 where did you go this year what did i do to push you away
1799796 it was me i just needed to figure out who i was after the chamber and all the events
1799797 i dont know harry i swear to you it wont happen again
1799798 youre right i deserved that ill make an unbreakable vow right now ill never leave you again wheres my wand
1799799 ive got to be the worlds biggest big push over but what i can i say its hard to say no to a beautiful redhead
1799800 i couldnt get him out of bed he seems as bad as yesterday
1799801 i told you yesterday that he just wants to be left alone both of you
1799802 ron listen to me harry needs to talk we have to get him to open up about his feelings or he will never work through this
1799803 harry will talk when and to whom he feels like it
1799804 if he wont get up for a beautiful redhead then i know weve got problems
1799805 disgrace on the house of black she is my poor mistress shame she didnt break her back
1799806 the blood traitor is talking to kreacher the shame the shame
1799807 im so happy for you dear now you children all go and get ready tomorrow we are heading back to kings cross
1799808 remember how he wouldnt talk to me much during the year and kept avoiding me well now its the exact opposite he kept wanting to talk and hinting that he had things he needed to tell me the weirdest thing was he asked about ginny several times
1799809 so ginny do you have anything you would like to tell the family
1799810 my boyfriend what in merlins name are you two on about
1799811 really where do you get your information you two are slipping in your old age
1799812 dont leave letters on the table you dont want us to read little gin gin
1799813 you had to find yourself what a load of bull you went off with your boyfriend and abandoned me im such an idiot for believing you
1799814 you arent going anywhere until we have a chat about mr thomas gin gin
1799815 besides hermione and i arent letting you up there with him in his state hes just now coming out of his funk you couldnt wait until we get to school to tell him
1799816 blame these two geniuses not that its any of your business but i am not and i have no intention of seeing dean thomas now get out of my way you load of prats before i bloody curse you into tomorrow
1799817 ginevra weasley you do not talk to your brothers that way come here right now so we can discuss this
1799818 harrys done something to the door nothing seems to affect it i think rons going to have to sleep on the couch
1799819 oh for merlins sake hermione of course not ive never wanted anyone but harry
1799820 im so glad you two are very good for each other after tonight i dont think he can deny that he fancies you now can he
1799821 he was up early this morning and insisted on going on ahead by himself he was quite insistent and so your father finally gave in and took him on well meet up with your father at the station later
1799822 harry that prat is in the back he sealed himself in a compartment and wont come out this is all your fault ron bellowed
1799823 im not fighting with you right now ron come yell at me later
1799824 really dean now is not the best time can we just talk later
1799825 as i was saying mr filch wanted me to tell you another 36 forbidden items have been added to the list posted on his door
1799826 another reminder the forest is still off limits to all students who value their lives and before i allow you to start your meal i have one last announcement as you may have noticed professor richards is not with us at the moment unfortunately certain events have taken him from the school for a temporary amount of time in the mean while i would like to introduce you to your new substitute for defense against the dart arts professor harry james potter
1799827 i wish you all good luck with your classes and beg you to remember what i have told you all tonight enjoy your meal
1799828 don mind em harry you wait by the end of the meal theyll totally have forgotten youre here
1799829 ill give you some advice if you dont have anything big planned for your first lessons just have them ask questions they might have for you
1799830 you know that way they can see youre just another wizard works for me when the young ones are nervous about being taught by a half giant
1799831 im here to continue your education on the topic of defense against the dark arts i have looked over the lesson plan that professor richards had outlined for you to learn this term all of the rules you had in his class will apply for mine homework is to be on my desk at the start of class any spells we practice in this room are only to be done with my supervision and please no dazing off during class
1799832 instead of continuing from where you left off before the holiday i thought we might have a day where we break the ice between each other to help us to get used to err each other
1799833 i think it will be easier for me to teach and for you to learn if we all become a little more familiar with each other so lets begin
1799834 i was wondering sir if we could ask you anything we want
1799835 you may ask me whatever you want as long as it isnt too personal and i hold the right to choose not to answer if i dont believe the question is important
1799836 professor potter i was wondering why you refuse to accept the order of merlin
1799837 i refuse the award every year because i believe there are many that deserve as much recognition for their contribution to the war as i do its not that i dont see it as an honor because i truly do but i wont accept it until everyone who fought for the same cause is awarded as well
1799838 wandless magic is an extremely hard skill to master mr hobbs yes i have done wandless magic but usually only by accident or in special circumstances even some of the most powerful wizards ive met could do very little of that kind of magic albus dumbledore being one of them
1799839 there are a few reasons one being i didnt want to play for a team who only wanted me because of my fame i would have loved to play quidditch but only if my skill earned me a spot not my name the second reason is because i have always had a passion for defense and becoming an auror seemed like a logical choice
1799840 sir is it true that you fought off hundreds of dementors when you were our age in the forbidden forest
1799841 i was very young for some of the things ive done and usually the odds and the circumstances were always against me but with the help of the people i love i was able to find courage and press on no matter how bad i wanted to give up
1799842 sir im confused how could you be scared but brave at the same time when im scared i usually run or hide
1799843 ms naughty i believe you are one step closer to true courage than most of the boys in this room
1799844 how could anyone find courage without first finding fear how would one know what even courage is without fear to be brave is to face fear you will all do well to remember that youre dismissed
1799845 well your fianc e had to talk to people in hogsmeade
1799846 pretty well havent really taught them anything though been too busy recounting our past adventures for the last week
1799847 i thought that might happen its probably a good thing though that youre getting all of it out in the open so they can start to focus on their studies so anything really interesting on the agenda for next week
1799848 not really well im suppose to start teaching the sixth years about the unforgivables
1799849 i was hoping that maybe they had already been taught about them or that they had been taken out of the lesson plans now that riddles gone
1799850 i hope you do a better job at it than moody did
1799851 i still have nightmares about that spider dancing all over the place
1799852 honestly ron first of all it wasnt moody teaching us it was crouch second i think harry will have a little more tact than a death eater had
1799853 pretty much the same old stuff crew is still working us like house el dogs i mean to get us ready for the exams i have been helping george a little bit at the shop but thats about it
1799854 i havent been doing anything real exciting im still trying to find a house elf that is willing to represent their kind as an equal magical creature but none of them dare do it
1799855 because none of them want to be free they like their lives how they are
1799856 im not saying they shouldnt be free its just they ah well dont know anything different
1799857 you are getting a lot smoother than you use to be
1799858 well mum has been bugging me constantly about the wedding its like she thinks its going to be next weekend or something shes driving me mad you should be thanking merlin you got this job at hogwarts or she would be putting you through the same torture as me
1799859 if you had taken my advice a long time ago and moved out you wouldnt be having this problem now
1799860 i didnt see the point since i was going to be so busy with the harpies it didnt seem right to pay for a flat that i was hardly going to stay in which reminds me my suspension ends next week ill be starting for the next game isnt that great
1799861 its something i should have told you a long time ago
1799862 i thought this stuff was supposed to be over i thought most of the death eaters had been caught
1799863 you know how it was after the first time voldemort fell from power ron
1799864 there were still few death eaters who believed that riddle would come back there were still few who killed just to prove they were still loyal even without proof that voldemort would rise again
1799865 if it was a death eater proving his loyalty why wouldnt he leave his mark i mean wouldnt he have left the dark mark or something to prove that he was a follower of you know who
1799866 not necessarily according to how harry described it kingsley and crew think whoever it was was looking for something something they wouldnt have wanted put in a safer place maybe they were trying to keep it quiet so whatever they were after didnt become any harder to obtain
1799867 i dont think they were worried about whatever they want becoming harder to get
1799868 if that were the case they never would have killed the bensons would they anyone could have realized that someone would notice them missing i mean they would have known that as soon as the aurors found out that the bensons were dead and winston was missing that the ministry would make nearly impossible for them to get whatever he was working on or knew i think that whatever it is they want they know that the ministry doesnt have it and that the only person who knows what they want and where to find it is winston benson
1799869 theres something else isnt it youre holding something back from us still arent you
1799870 when they found the bodies they saw that the killer did actually leave a mark
1799871 after he had murdered the bensons the killer carved something into their foreheads but crew or kingsley dont know what the true meaning of it is yet so there is no reason to worry
1799872 theyre not sure what the killer wants to say he might just be trying to get someone publicity or
1799873 that guy would have to be a nutter i mean more than he is already
1799874 harry more dark wizards fear you than well the thought of being thrown into azkaban i mean you defeated you know who for merlins sake
1799875 by sheer luck though i never would have walked out of that forest alive if he hadnt taken my blood or i hadnt disarmed malfoy
1799876 yeah but he doesnt know that does he and everyone who does is on our side
1799877 well its obvious what we need to do next then isnt it
1799878 we need to find out what winston benson was working on
1799879 yeah and i have a plan that i think will get us exactly that
1799880 reply to bbbs about why complaint is beyond bbb scope
1799881 harry they thought that you might never wake up i knew you would but
1799882 miss weasley i must ask that you control yourself i know you are excited about mr potter waking but you need to move away from him so i can check him over please go to the bathroom and clean yourself up
1799883 yes miss weasley you can retrieve a strengthening potion from the potions cabinet for mr potter also it would be prudent to give him a nutrient potion and an energy restoring potion
1799884 miss weasley keep a close eye on him please i need to tell the headmaster and professor mcgonagall that mr potter is awake
1799885 you must be wondering why i was using your shoulder for a handkerchief
1799886 well i um i think that oh how do i say this
1799887 its okay youre okay please dont cry ginny please dont cry
1799888 if i had given you more attention last summer i might have realized that you really were developing feelings for me
1799889 um ginny im not really sure what you are blaming yourself for but i think you said that they found an answer for our problem what can you tell me about it
1799890 im not sure what i said but she was distressed and when i asked about what hermione had found she started crying and then ran over there
1799891 well harry i am very glad to see you awake i will not hesitate to say that you gave everyone a horrible fright many of your friends are quite worried about you some to the point of near hysterics as in the case of mr longbottom others were more content to wait patiently as in the case of mr ronald weasley
1799892 i believe you said that miss weasley has already informed you that a means of solving our problem has been discovered
1799893 but when i asked her for details she started crying saying something was all her fault and ran to the other side of the room
1799894 what i dont understand is how this could all be ginnys fault we didnt know about the second prophecy until after it had expired
1799895 she said that in her first year tom riddle told her she would be responsible for harrys death
1799896 he told her that harry would die because of her because she had been such a stupid selfish little girl
1799897 it also does not help that she just found out the price of this ritual succeeding and she is really upset by the thought that harry will have to die in order to accomplish it
1799898 young lady we have discussed this repeatedly you are not to blame for this situation if we had been aware of that prophecy before it had to be fulfilled you know that everyone would have made the best of the situation in order to help both you and harry live a long and happy life together now do try to calm down
1799899 i need you to go find ron and hermione for me and bring them back with you as fast as possible
1799900 i take it from everyones reaction and what was said that the solution involves my death
1799901 i see okay how long have i been in hospital this time
1799902 we were beginning to think you might never wake up
1799903 harry i am not looking forward to the discussion we now must have so i guess i will begin by asking you how much you remember about the attack
1799904 i remember they came from the lake i assume they used portkeys and left the same way
1799905 other than them not trying to either kill or capture me
1799906 they were very open about their attack they seemed to be trying to draw attention to themselves and away from someone or something else
1799907 the attack in which you were injured was indeed a diversion its purpose was to distract our attention away from a hidden passage into the castle in which peter pettigrew entered
1799908 two days after the attack he placed mr thomas under the imperius curse and proceeded to question him the questions were mostly about you but some were about miss weasley
1799909 after two days of questioning pettigrew killed mr thomas then used a dose of polyjuice potion and impersonated his victim in an attempt to first assault and then place miss weasley under the imperius in order to have her kill you
1799910 i know i should have allowed remus and sirius to kill that worthless rat when they first caught him
1799911 or madam pomfrey will make us leave before i can tell you all that i need to as you can see miss weasley is safe i must say that pettigrew learned to his detriment not to make that young woman angry he did place the imperious curse on her but she successfully defeated him and overcame his control not once but twice in less than an hour
1799912 he was sent here to force her to kill you harry
1799913 is that why she was blaming herself for this situation is there anything that i can do to help
1799914 it is only part of why she is blaming herself and yes there is something you can do
1799915 you can continue to comfort her and not be judgmental of her or yourself
1799916 harry we need you not to let this interfere with your friendship with ginny or anyone else
1799917 if they think you are going to sink into yourself to protect them then they will not hesitate to hex some sense into you nor will molly and i am i clear on this point
1799918 i concur on both of those points you need to remember that you did the right thing when you persuaded remus and sirius not to kill pettigrew that night at the end of your third year i have no doubt of that and will never doubt it
1799919 good now you need to know what happened after the incidents we just told you about
1799920 the majority of the research groups had agreed the answer to our problem was to perform a time reversal ritual when the meeting was disturbed as we were called back to the hospital wing to find that the person we had thought was dean thomas was in fact peter pettigrew
1799921 you would think that getting hit by miss weasleys bat bogey hex once would have been enough to get him to leave her alone but when we arrived he was huddled in that corner
1799922 he was obviously still under the impression that he could follow his masters orders but had failed to take into account the strong willpower of miss weasley and more importantly her love for you
1799923 as i have said harry you should not judge based on past association
1799924 she really does have feelings of love for you and i know you have some feelings for her as well
1799925 and my wife isnt the only one to have noticed that
1799926 remus commented to me on new years eve about your noticeable preoccupation with watching ginny
1799927 i dont know if i can do that but i will most certainly try
1799928 i think we should let miss granger fill us in on the time reversal ritual
1799929 miss granger please remember they already know what you are about to say and they are not very comfortable with hearing it again
1799930 i wish you had been this insistent about my sitting with you a few years ago
1799931 you do realize that all of the books i have read say what you just did is supposed to be impossible right
1799932 that is an effect of the emotion of love on a wizards or a witchs magical abilities
1799933 remember that the dark arts require you to use hatred and anger to power the spells but these emotions can only tear apart the soul of the individual
1799934 however spells powered by love and other positive emotions are more powerful because love while it too can tear a soul apart will also strengthen and heal one
1799935 miss granger i think i need to leave you four to discuss what you have discovered i shall be available should any of you need to talk about this situation later
1799936 poppy i will be leaving but i ask you to allow harrys two friends to remain would you complain if he rested while they visited
1799937 headmaster i fail to see how he can get the rest he needs with so many visitors
1799938 poppy harry has had so little time to spend with his friends this last month
1799939 i know that you would prefer to keep him in his bed for a few more days but he needs to have some of his questions answered and i am sure he would rest more comfortably if his friends were close by
1799940 very well they can stay but i expect them to keep their voices down
1799941 miss weasley i expect you to insure mr potter does not become overly exhausted
1799942 what have you been told and what do you want to know
1799943 i have actually been told very little about the solution you found other than no one was happy about it but i was told about the return of wormtail
1799944 well how much information do you want i know you usually want me to just tell you the important points and not include the background information but you already know most of it so
1799945 hermione please just the solution you can fill harry in on the details afterwards we know you want to tell us everything but start with the solution and let harry ask the questions that he wants you to answer okay
1799946 i found what proved to be the only viable solution to our current problem the book is entitled a masters thesis concerning chronomancy and the consequences thereof and it was written by horace james potter
1799947 i asked professor dumbledore and he mentioned that this horace was a second cousin to your fourth great grandfather
1799948 okay as i was saying i was only able to find one means of successfully achieving what we need to accomplish
1799949 harry i am sorry but your death is the catalyst of this ritual
1799950 if it is successful you will awaken in your body at an earlier date and time but you will only be able to advise your younger self if not then you will at least be spared the suffering the rest of the world will have to endure
1799951 hermione you know as well as i do that failure is not an option if this is our only choice then this has to succeed now what is involved in this ritual and how soon can we complete it
1799952 good so when can we get started what do we need to accomplish it
1799953 but it is suggested that certain times of the year would work better than others improving the chance of success harry we need to give this the greatest chance of success possible which means you must be patient
1799954 how long do we wait when can we get this over with
1799955 the best date for us is the spring equinox at the exact time the sun crosses the equator back into the northern hemisphere
1799956 ive checked and that will be at 12 55 on thursday march twentieth we have more than enough time to plan this and prepare everything okay harry
1799957 hermione wasnt there something about a rest period before he would be able to act or even be awake
1799958 you will need a week to ten days of rest to build up your strength both magical and physical that recovery time will be for your younger body to adjust to having your older soul in addition to its own
1799959 but hermione and the others searched all the available information and this seems to be the only answer
1799960 excuse me but if were done for now i need to go to the loo then i think afterwards ill go on to the great hall its almost lunch time hermione can you cancel the privacy charms please
1799961 dumbledore mentioned informing you about peter what else did they tell you
1799962 and then told me what peter did and tried to do after he got into the castle both to dean and to ginny
1799963 however they didnt tell me what happened to him after he was caught
1799964 im not really sure of how he awoke or how he got another wand however we found madam pomfrey unconscious by the fireplace when we arrived after she had summoned us from professor dumbledores office lying in the corner was a short balding man who was being attacked by the biggest bat bogeys i had ever seen
1799965 and he had to be reminded of why you should never make a red haired witch angry he always was a slow learner that lesson will stay with him forever
1799966 the hex ended and we gave him a dose of veritaserum remus dumbledore moody and i questioned him about why he was here what plans were and the whereabouts of dean thomas
1799967 mr thomas apparently gave pettigrew quite a lot of information about you and what was happening around the school we do not know how much of it he may have told you know who but we are certain that he was informed of at least some of it
1799968 what happened to pettigrew i mean did he go to azkaban or
1799969 the veritaserum wore off quickly and he managed to get a wand from severus snape who was standing near by and to hit ginny with the imperius again his actions resulted in his death when he was hit with a jumble of hexes jinxes and curses
1799970 a few of the spells pettigrew was hit with reacted badly and he died of a heart attack before a healer could assist him
1799971 well moony didnt i say in my third year that if wormtail escaped i would agree with you and sirius doing as you originally planned now no one is really sure who killed him but he has died for the crimes he committed he can never harm anyone again i do not regret that he is dead i only regret that decent people had to kill him
1799972 so what do you think ginny will it work or are we all wasting our time
1799973 you would think that after sleeping for a month i would have more energy and not feel so tired
1799974 you have been quite active since waking about four hours ago and your body needs to have more rest to recover from the damage you received in the battle
1799975 while i dont know the tune it has an oddly familiar quality to it what are you humming
1799976 it is a lullaby my mum used to sing to me when i was younger
1799977 there were nights when only that song and my favourite bedtime story could get me to sleep
1799978 well my favourite bedtime story when i was a little girl was the boy who lived it changed after i met you and got to know you better but until i was about eleven years old i loved that story more than any other sorry
1799979 why did it stop being your favourite story i know you still had a crush on me for at least another year
1799980 actually i would probably be able to fall asleep faster if you were to tell it to me
1799981 just out of curiosity when was the last time you heard that story
1799982 i said last friday now will you please go to sleep
1799983 never ever ever let me hear you try to take the blame for things that were not your fault you are not to blame for what happened to dean and you are not to blame for the attacks on the school and you are not to blame for the deaths deaths that tom bloody riddle has caused
1799984 this is your only warning next time youll be bat bogeyed so fast your head will spin are we clear he and his followers are to blame and not you
1799985 one more thing i need you to promise that you will help me with deciding something promise me you will hear me out and help me make this decision not leave me here to make it on my own it is one that will affect both of us and i cant make it alone
1799986 i think i can promise that and to wait until everything is said
1799987 first i should ask what day and time they were planning to send me to have they said anything
1799988 i overheard mum and madam pomfrey talking this morning they said that dumbledore wanted to send you back no further than mid august of last year
1799989 i agree i was just thinking that it might be best to have a few options of what days on which to return
1799990 well i can think of at least three or four
1799991 the first would be during the summer between my fourth and fifth year just after i returned to privet drive following the triwizard tournament
1799992 while that might give you enough time to settle things with me i was already dating michael corner and you would have been competing with him for my attention plus hermiones usual rampages about revising for your owls remember how much you and ron enjoyed those oh and lets not forget cho chang
1799993 please must you remind me of the second biggest mistake of my life
1799994 cho was the worst person i could have chosen to go out with and my crush on her was over before you stopped dating michael thank you
1799995 harry i was just teasing about cho i didnt mean to bring up unhappy memories
1799996 i know you were teasing but that doesnt stop it from hurting well i guess that is a lesson i can teach my younger self when the time comes maybe it will help him to want to get to know you sooner
1799997 we had just ruled out the summer between your fourth and fifth year so what is the next time you think would be a good choice
1799998 perhaps just before the yule ball if i go back far enough i can invite you to the ball before neville does
1799999 while that might work i cant remember the exact day he asked me and that would make it harder for you to get to the right time and place i only remember it was after the first task and before the end of the term we should keep that one in mind though and discuss any others
