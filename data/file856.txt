8560001 even though some of these enforced social roles have resulted in better treatment for mentally retarded individuals than others none of them has allowed for the possibility that mentally retarded individuals are in their own ways capable of learning achieving and becoming productive members of society

8560025 without these skills reading and writing they may not fully develop their abilities and optimally contribute to council activities especially when affairs of council are driven by agendas reports submitted and minutes
8560026 the 32 percent of councillors who require abet training should receive support as a matter of priority particularly as this report shows councillors with higher levels of education stand a better chance to serve in senior positions such as mayoral committees
8560027 some councillors are not comfortable in doing business in languages that are not their mother tongues
8560028 this study has helped us a lot together with the local government sector education and training authority seta and the department of provincial and local government in terms of service delivery
8560029 we need to take this illiteracy into consideration when we improve capacity for councillors for them to understand what government is trying to do when it comes to service delivery
8560030 we need to understand where we come from because some of our councillors were in the struggle and did not have a chance to go to school their political parties have deployed them to municipalities
8560031 the practical implications are that if so many of them do not have proper reading and writing skills then we can assume that councils end up approving budgets they cant interpret

8560061 ten years ago there was one korean player on the tour now theres 40 or 45 plus the japanese
8560062 its important to note that this whole policy is directed at international members its not about the korean players
8560063 everyones been talking discrimination and its all about getting korean players off the tour and really its the wrong thing to assume its not about that
8560064 the fact is there are a lot of korean players and a few japanese and some of them not most cant speak enough english
8560065 its important that they are able to communicate with the sponsors with their playing partners and even with rules officials
8560066 its not like theyre just left to do it on their own the lpga are going to provide professional services to allow them to work on it and become better
8560067 the players want to be able to speak better english theyre all working on it as well

8560069 recent events in georgia cast the shadow of war and nuclear threat over foreign minister stephen smiths decision on the russian nuclear treaty
8560070 it is clearly not appropriate and should have no place in australias future
8560071 that wasnt the aim of this meeting the agreement has been signed and russia doesnt see any connection between what is going on in the caucasus and co operation in the field of peaceful atomic energy
8560072 we of course are strictly against any worsening of relations between australia and russia
8560073 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict
8560074 mr smith has said that he will be conveying australias protest over the situation in georgia to the russian ambassador in australia
8560075 but the minister must now go one step further and show russia that there are consequences to its actions and its trampling over georgias sovereignty
8560076 australia should move to reposition our representation away from moscow of the nine former soviet states who still receive australian representation via our moscow embassy
8560077 many if not all of these countries are known to be very uncomfortable with continuing australian representation via russia
8560078 the boards focus for the year has been to diversify the groups revenue streams and in particular enhance annuity style income in order to provide a solid foundation for further growth
8560079 notwithstanding that the financial services sector is under significant pressure with access to credit becoming more restricted and an increasing need to focus on cash flow demands the board remains committed to a growth strategy through targeted acquisitions and expansion of its dealer group in regional australia

8560081 the boks wouldnt be in this position if there was a director of coaching who helped map out a style of play
8560082 the job requires someone whos been at the top of the game and who can offer advice and set out a structured plan for the springboks
8560083 i dont want to be the coach but im concerned about the way the team is playing
8560084 i havent spoken to saru about it but i would be interested to hear what they have to say when they hear im interested
8560085 if ever there was a powder keg about to explode it is the springbok camp where on centre stage is a passionate but misguided coach who doggedly refuses to concede that he has got it wrong
8560086 you have players who are privately seething and on the point of rebellion these guys are fed up with being led on a wild goose chase
8560087 it has been reported that springboks captain victor matfield was given three different game plans by the three coaches in the set up
8560088 the lack of fuss with which this has been accepted shows that de villiers has liberated us from evaluating players on anything other than their playing credentials
8560089 and for a public more obsessed with what divides us as opposed to what unites us this is a step forward
8560090 its very pleasing hes obviously had a long stint out of the senior team hes had a frustrating run in the last 12 or 15 months

8560097 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8560098 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8560099 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8560100 i think its an important signal in the overall direction of what we hope to get back on track in doha but in its own right it stands as a significant achievement
8560101 tariffs will be eliminated in all major countries on goods representing around 95 percent of trade
8560102 the ministers see the agreement as paving the way to enhancing the regions economic integration and acting as an impetus to deepen and broaden the trade and investment among the twelve participating countries
8560103 we of course would have preferred it to have been more ambitious but thats the nature of these things

8560148 i dont think the league will only be about real madrid if we play to our level it will be difficult for them to better us
8560149 we think we have young guys that have talent that are ready to step up and perform but until you get into game action youre never really going to know for sure
8560150 last year we tended to air it out a little more than sometimes we wanted to
8560151 that was for a lot of reasons but i think to be a good team you have to run the ball thats our goal right now to be good running the football to set that mentality to be tough and to be physical
8560152 if you ask them if youre always blocking somebody going backwards its a lot tougher than coming off the ball and being aggressive and hitting somebody
8560153 you have to let them do that little bit to set the tone to pop the defense in the mouth and i think the pass blocking becomes a little easier
8560154 i think i have a little bit of a temper and obviously when the game starts and coordinators are on the sideline they can feel the pulse of the team and crank it up when they need to and pat them on the back when they need to
8560155 i think it can be a bonus hopefully that happens this year
8560156 hes been a big part of my life and hes really brought me along as a player
8560157 i think its going to be fun i know he likes to be aggressive and he wants us to go after people
8560158 hes more tell me what the play is and let me drop back and throw it
8560159 i think you have to have a good balance of giving him simple things to do and let him throw that sucker
8560160 i actually was one of those guys that wasnt afraid to run what i wanted
8560161 occasionally id slip something in there as long as it worked the coach was ok with it
8560162 juventus are obviously a much bigger club both in italy and worldwide so hopefully it will be a step up
8560163 we will probably be dominating more games compared to aston villa in england so it will be different in that sense
8560164 obviously there are differences in the style of football overall but its all been good so far
8560165 weve had quite a lot of tough games in pre season which has been good weve done well overall and had a good start in the champions league as well
8560166 i had a guy come up from nfl madden and he told me i was their lowest rated player
8560167 and i was like thats nothing to me it makes me feel even better because this time next year i want to see what my rating is
8560168 its a lot of pressure but im ready for it
8560169 its really accelerated his development and hes worked really hard at it
8560170 could he play i think hes athletic enough but youd like to get him more seasoned before he had to be out there
8560171 this is a foundation for what we want to do this year
8560172 winning preseason games is not the important topic what its really about is playing your technique and fundamentals and getting that right before the season starts
8560173 there are a lot of guys who have been starters before who might not be starting right now because the other guy is performing better
8560174 when youre in our situation a young football team sometimes the easy thing to do when guys are in a position where theres not a clear cut favorite the easy thing to do in the past was lets go get a veteran
8560175 were not doing that were trying to build a football team if its a good veteran and he fits in our system and he does what we want him to do then thats fine but we dont just go out and get a veteran to say we got a veteran we did that a little bit last year it didnt work out too well in certain positions
8560176 he was a great player here did a lot for this football team won a lot of games i know im going to go shake his hand
8560177 the thing about preseason is you want to get better you want your players to get better
8560178 im trying to put everything behind me stay healthy and be a leader this season is about stepping up my game on the field
8560179 everybody is talking about hype and everything i dont worry about none of that im just here to play football i hate watching football from the sideline
8560180 i hope it will be a breakout year for him
8560181 we are all sitting here with our opinions but we have no clue how some of these guys will respond i watch them every day and i recruited them and i still dont know how they will respond in front of 100 000 fans
8560182 sergios a great athlete he can run you down he can pass rush you he can hit you as hard as he wants to when you cant do what you want to do and you have all that talent its like looking outside when youre grounded and you cant go out youre stuck in the room and it sucks
8560183 this is a tough profession to stay for 10 years
8560184 the objective in this profession is to win win championships and win national championships and ive done neither
8560185 youll face the question of hes a nice guy who comes in second youll always face that until you change the facts
8560186 this game is what it is right now and theyve done a really good job in recruiting
8560187 i know they havent won a title yet but theyve knocked on the door a couple of times
8560188 the guys a competitor he did an outstanding job at tulane and now hes done a nice job at clemson

8560192 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8560193 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8560194 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8560195 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8560196 theres nothing about the tests that is designed to create anxiety or create a sense of evaluation or create a sense of being compared to someone else
8560197 once the information is available the potential exists for school administrators to use it to track students and make premature assessments

8560203 the u s marines have always had a good attitude but iraq is showing a huge turnaround since mid 2006 it has taken some time but infrastructure there is returning and weve been training the iraqi police and army with good results
8560204 when insurgents hide weapons in a cache for example we wont go in right away because if available iraqs police and army will handle it were observing more and more and making sure all goes ok
8560205 were very excited the marines do such a great job of keeping parents informed on whats going over there and here
8560206 this is one big rush because all we talk about for months is getting home it finally happened
8560207 were very close and not having him around was tough hes my rock and its hard when you cant talk to your best friend
8560208 im impressed with all people at allstate arena this was just like what happened at my first tour in 2005
8560209 this is scary as hell i worry about him all the time but im told the fighting in iraq is not as dangerous now like it was a few years ago
8560210 hes shaving off his mustache after he gets here and kisses me
8560211 clio the muse of history is as thoroughly infected with lies as a street whore with syphilis
8560212 recognize the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organization based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace loving states and open to membership by all such states large and small for the maintenance of international peace and security
8560213 if your enemy shoots your toe you shoot his head
8560214 putting an end to the rule of gangsterism in international affairs
8560215 let us well ponder that statement which i have made tonight
8560216 putting an end to the rule of gangsterism in international affairs
8560217 the word revolution is synonymous with the word nationality it implies a redrawing of the map of europe a cancellation of all treaties based on conquest compromise and the wills of reigning houses a reorganization to be made in line with the temperaments and capabilities of the peoples and with their free consent a removal of the causes of selfish hostility among the peoples a balancing of power note the british catchword mm among them and therefore the possibility of brotherhood the sovereignty of that goal must replace the sovereignty of force caprice and chance
8560218 nationality is the share that god has assigned to the given people in the progress of humanity it is the mission which each people must fulfill the task it must do on earth that the divine idea may attain its full expression it is the work which gives a people the right to citizenship in the world it is the sign of that peoples personality and of the rank it occupies among other peoples its brothers
8560219 those who are the best in wisdom and virtue among those who believe in eternal things in the mission of gods creatures on earth in the worship of progressive truth
8560220 even if the military is firmly in charge of pakistans nuclear programme where is the civilian component in decision making
8560221 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear programme
8560222 there is no indication that the military does not exercise full control over pakistans nuclear assets
8560223 anytime theres anxiety in the oil markets which there is right now as a result of this weather system youre going to see prices head north unfortunately
8560224 youd get ten bucks and it lasts you two weeks
8560225 we dont really know whats going to happen as a result of the weather system thats likely to be visiting the gulf so thats probably good advice
8560226 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8560227 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8560228 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8560229 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8560230 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems

8560262 if downside risks to the dollar emerge from here on the market will keep in mind the possibility of similar action by authorities
8560263 the report would have had a huge psychological impact if it had come out when the dollar was trading around 100 yen
8560264 if anything the fact that officials recognized the concern about the dollars decline seems somewhat supportive for the dollar as maybe was not so neglectful

8560307 weve gotten to that point any additional hype isnt serving us well its a concern
8560308 i think it will be similar in extent but hopefully not the same strategy we took with the sims

8560365 from our point of view we know exactly what we have to do we have to win the game
8560366 its an easy game from that position because we dont have to worry about anything else the key is that we play well and win so its a straightforward exercise for us
8560367 it was a difficult evening the important thing from our point of view is making sure we start better than we did in the last game
8560368 if we do that and if we score then maybe midtjylland will become a little bit anxious and we will capitalise on that
8560369 he trained yesterday for the first time back with the group
8560370 he looked sharp like he had enjoyed the experience and we hope to tap into that
8560371 we had a glimpse of him before he left for the olympics so it was obviously frustrating from our point of view that we havent been able to have him available up until now
8560372 but hes a good player an exceptionally talented young man and hes a good option for us
8560373 he gives us more presence than maybe we had in the first game
8560374 he was with the physios yesterday and obviously went through all the tests he needed to do to ensure that hell be available

8560410 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners will be focusing on how the institutions are handling cutbacks in home equity lines of credit
8560411 there are clearly rules that apply when an institution wants to suspend or reduce an equity line of credit
8560412 our goal in issuing the guidance was to bring all those rules together in one place

8560417 a major national crisis with potentially perilous implications that will go beyond our national economy if not properly resolved
8560418 the response to this national crisis must begin from a clear understanding that the situation which now exists in the niger delta region cannot be resolved through force of arms
8560419 niger delta a major national crisis and admirable vision and objectives of delta state governments economic strategy
8560420 the country must recognise that we now have in the niger delta region a major national crisis with potentially perilous implications that will go beyond our national economy if not properly resolved
8560421 the primary responsibility for this neglect and indifference lies with our national administrations which have over the years not only controlled the proceeds from the main resource of the region but also have allowed the multinational oil companies to operate in the area in a manner that would not be tolerated in more environment conscious countries
8560422 the response to this national crisis must begin from a clear understanding that the situation which now exists in the niger delta region cannot be resolved through force of arms
8560423 the crisis in the niger delta region should be treated as a national emergency by the federal government
8560424 fortunately there is no lack of evidence of what needs to be done to address the clearly justified grievances of the people of the region
8560425 for the dialogue to be meaningful there should be immediate distillation of the ideas and proposals contained in that communique and the earlier reports to which i have referred together with effective consultations with the stakeholders with a view to updating and determining the order of their implementation
8560426 in all this the emphasis must be to move from rhetoric to action
8560427 in the pursuit of both peace and development the media as a collective has a seminal role
8560428 in its development strategy i believe that this delta state government is demonstrating admirable vision and objectives
8560429 in addition to the impressive progress being made in pursuance of his three point agenda by channelling 50 of its oil derivation fund to the development of the oil producing areas in the state through the delta state oil mineral producing areas development commission desopadec and by stressing diversification in its development agenda governor uduaghans administration has acknowledged that neither the oil and gas reserves nor the current high price of oil in the world market will last for ever
8560430 because oil and gas are finite resources and because there are widespread continuing global efforts to find alternative sources of energy both for ecological and high cost of oil reasons many oil producing countries are investing their current high revenue in long term infrastructural and national assets
8560431 we must therefore ask the question how are we in nigeria spending our current high revenue from our oil exports
8560432 for every company that is coming to be involved in the national gas master plan in delta state some equity must go to the host communities if you are coming to be involved in exploration as part of the gas master plan laying of pipelines or construction of the central process unit or whatever company that will come out of it some equity must go to the community and i stand here as governor to say that when that happens the state government is going to be involved on behalf of the communities in getting such equity
8560433 i dont think we are asking for too much i am only suggesting a long term measure to solve the problem currently the federal government holds 60 per cent equity and the international oil companies iocs hold 40 per cent if you take five per cent from the federal government and five percent from the iocs and give it to the host communities what is that
8560434 i have been called a militant and sponsor of militants but i believe and i insist that military force will not solve the niger delta problem the military may win the fight but the military will not win the war and that simply means that if you order the military into the creeks today you can destroy militant camps and villages but at the end of the day it does not require too many people to do the damage to oil facilities destroy the camps destroy the villages just three of these boys will enter into warri and start doing damage to warri which you cannot control
8560435 our current constitution is not friendly to the people of the niger delta the constitution removed our land from us and everything in that land one of these laws is the petroleum act they have to be reviewed
8560436 let me say it you dont need to amend the constitution of the country to deal with the issue of derivation the constitution simply says not less than 13 per cent all the national assembly has to do is to say 50 per cent it does not require constitutional amendment all these issues have to be looked at our laws have to be looked at

8560445 consolidation in the german leisure carry market is inevitable and tui travel has said that until the situation is resolved this will be a hurdle to improving operational performance
8560446 i think everyone you talk to would say this is a marvelous thing

8560450 but he had the hardest time loving himself and that was the most difficult thing about being his friend for me watching him torture himself
8560451 good soul but he was a tortured soul but he loved his family and he loved his friends
8560452 and it was shining more than it had for a very long time
8560453 and her willingness to stand in front of him as he was reluctant to love himself and insisted on it caused him to eventually see the light
8560454 that we could all see it so much all of the time when he would put that horn in his mouth and make the most astonishingly honest music that could knock you over and it would sink right to the middle of you
8560455 he was standing right there and im not sure if i saw him fall asleep but i definitely saw him wake up
8560456 he also fell asleep next to me in his old blue volkswagen station wagon driving down 64 once
8560457 he could have done that for a living though it may not have been as lucrative
8560458 he told them with an honesty the same way he played
8560459 i would tell him jokes just so i could hear him tell them after me
8560460 leroi would engage me in animated conversation whenever i would encounter him at home or at church
8560461 more often than not he felt that the music in the episcopal church left a lot to be desired
8560462 i stood up to leave and he said hang on a sec
8560463 he was in his wheelchair and he took the better part of three or four minutes to get his wheels locked and he wouldnt let me leave until he stood up

8560487 shanghai offers ample hotel and hotel apartment accommodation with a wide variety of locations and tariffs
8560488 these places have no relationship to us chinese and besides the upper class atmosphere in these western hotels is very solemn every move and gesture seems completely regulated
8560489 given the limited space and the fact that we are housed in a historical building we cannot afford modern facilities such as a swimming pool and a tennis court
8560490 so it would be a waste of time to ask to be reevaluated
8560491 this is a reasonable price reflecting the true value of the hotel
8560492 i stayed at the indian suite which was truly huge and very well appointed for usd500 for five days the hotel has seven suites all decorated with a different theme the indian german french american british russian and japanese suites all reflecting the different foreign concessions that shanghai had at the time the hotel was built they are still there

8560502 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8560503 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8560504 knows both the opportunities and the pitfalls and you want that experience
8560505 daschle added that obama might have to disaggregate his comprehensive health care and energy proposals to pass them piece by piece
8560506 has drawn more attention in this presidential campaign than in recent elections
8560507 political reality is that health care reform is just one of many issues on voters minds and even then expanding coverage matters less than controlling the rise in health care costs

8560527 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8560528 reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy too many of our neighbors are living in poverty and too many are living without health insurance
8560529 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8560530 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of schip over president bushs two vetoes
8560531 are expensive and when tax revenues fall it is going to be harder to keep them up
8560532 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008 vitez philadelphia inquirer 8 27
8560533 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8560534 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8560535 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8560536 were entirely attributable to an increase in the number of people enrolled in medicaid and other public programs
8560537 is clear is that economic growth alone will not cut it for most american families
8560538 means more progressive taxation increasing access to affordable health care investing more in public education
8560539 president bush was too busy cutting taxes on top earners to think about any of these priorities the next president must do much better
8560540 truth be told we already have a government funded health care system we just pretend we dont
8560541 theres this supposed mix of private and public insurance but the fact is the u s government you know we the taxpayers spend nearly a quarter more for government health care programs than say canada a country that is supposed to have government controlled health care
8560542 looks great until you see that whats declining is private insurance coverage and whats increasing is the number of people eligible for government programs such as medicaid
8560543 its time to organize government health care into a single payer system one that covers all u s residents
8560544 a closer inspection of the numbers shows some dark clouds around the silver lining
8560545 while total enrollment in private insurance remained stable due to population growth it eroded slightly in percentage terms continuing a downward trend
8560546 growth in coverage was mostly concentrated in public programs partially due to an aging population shifting to medicare but especially in medicaid
8560547 each year a significant portion of the uninsured qualifies for government assistance but hasnt signed up
8560548 in other words the latest batch of data shows again that the policy problem of the uninsured isnt as large as election year opportunism would have it
8560549 the genuine hardships that the fragmented health care system metes out to many families
8560550 insurance is more expensive than it needs to be thanks to regulation and other market interference
8560551 who typically have less generous plans as part of their compensation
8560552 restoring the tax parity of health dollars would allow individuals to buy policies themselves rather than rely on their employers and take those policies with them wherever they work
8560553 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8560554 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test

8560562 the budget cuts will be split across the departments and colleges at the university
8560563 right now the dean of the college of medicine is meeting with the staff and faculty to discuss what they think should be cut
8560564 if theres less faculty then less students can get into their programs so i think that would probably be the worst area for the cuts to go to
8560565 i think theres always a possibility that the university could raise tuition
8560566 i expect it to go up but budget cuts could affect that decision they could also raise dorm rates or do a lot of other things
8560567 lots of things including increased utility costs affect tuition rates
8560568 its not as simple as saying because there will be budget cuts tuition will definitely go up
8560569 you cant really say the legislature gave a lot of money to design and construction and took money away from other departments because the money came from different sources
8560570 were going to outline what were referring to as the new asua
8560571 probably the biggest transition weve had now in the resource center is that all the resources that a club could possibly need including recognition is there at asua
8560572 im really excited to finally see that all the clubs are going to go to one spot instead of having to go to the center for student involvement and leadership and back then asua for funding and appropriations and then back to csil for recognition
8560573 its not just asua student government anymore its asua your student government
8560574 which is really our focus on outreaching to the students making sure that they know that the only reason were here is to serve them and make their lives better
8560575 weve worked to really improve asuas ability to outreach to students to represent students and to really improve the lives of students on our campus
8560576 when candidates come to the next round of elections the youth vote will matter the student vote will matter
8560577 and they will be much more apt to go out and find out what students think what students want
8560578 you have more of an appreciation for something when you know more about it
8560579 this is the first year weve done wildcat and one of the biggest goals of the alumni association is to keep the heritage and traditions of the university alive
8560580 a university is more than just the four years that youre here
8560581 this is a major institution in america in research in teaching and in all that we do here if we could get our students to understand early on that they are a part of something that will really pay off in the long run the more likely they will have success
8560582 get involved guys go out there a be a part of the university
8560583 go to the first home football game this saturday sporting events is where you really feel the pride that is almost electric that is so important for the freshmen to experience right off the bat so they feel like they want to be a part of the wildcat family
8560584 at the beginning of each semester or long break from school we do see more colds and respiratory infections because people just get back from someplace else and they are sharing their germs with everyone else
8560585 but we work in small offices and there is really nothing i can do but keep going
8560586 the top three stds we most frequently see are genital herpes hpv and chlamydia although not necessarily in that order
8560587 if you have a penis or one of the people who is participating does put a condom on it
8560588 also were hoping that now that there is the hpv vaccine gardasil people will be getting that and the numbers will go down
8560589 ive had it since i was nine but it started hurting last year
8560590 so last years problems really started out as a growing pain
8560591 weve been working pretty much year round to keep her quads and hamstrings strong so that the joint functions properly
8560592 its pretty similar to what athletes in other jumping sports often go through
8560593 it can be painful its a lot of ups and downs
8560594 but i dont think theres an athlete out here thats playing a hundred percent pain free
8560595 it used to be a noticeable difference my knee was all flabby and skinny
8560596 i usually just sat on the sidelines during games and iced my knee
8560597 id be sitting there with a big old ice jug or id do rehab or ride a bike note email address will not be published
8560598 i feel like this year its finally begun to establish itself
8560599 this is what were going to be known for thats the most exciting part of this whole thing to me
8560600 we have the opportunity to be involved when its just gaining its roots growing and developing
8560601 its going to be one of those events thats going to define spirit at u of a one day
8560602 i think its important because there really isnt anything that makes one sport better than the other its just in terms of popularity
8560603 they get a lot of media attention just in general theyre just more exposed
8560604 we talk about football and all the fall sports now and basketball in winter but its not just solely about the big three sports its all around
8560605 when i came to washington state coach li believed in me
8560606 its my calling and im really meant for this job
8560607 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8560608 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8560609 i wouldnt put anyone above anyone else because i see them all on an equal basis
8560610 mcmanus khan galletti and neal have all shown that they are great players and none of them i would say are above the other
8560611 just starting in the summer you could just tell how much smoother the offense was working just because everyone knows what theyre supposed to do and how theyre supposed to do it
8560612 watch out for terrell turner terrell reese and delashaun dean too i mean those guys can play
8560613 it is going to be a very solid group and i am excited about the progress those guys have made
8560614 this year they have a lot of leadership and a lot of toughness and that is exactly what you need from your offensive line
8560615 things are going great we are all as prepared as we have ever been and we had a great camp and we are very excited about this season
8560616 there is a lot of enthusiasm every day and everyone is happy to be there and it is just a totally different situation
8560617 petes my boy but it is kind of part of the game you need to grow up and move on we will be fine
8560618 when i saw him out there playing i was like goodness gracious this guy can jump
8560619 he was just really athletic a big guy could move around and we just fell in love with him
8560620 college was never really in my future until i started playing football
8560621 its just real exciting to be here and to get the opportunity to come to college is a great experience
8560622 it is good to be the leader of the defense but the expectations are really really high but i like it because i enjoy the challenge and this year has already been great before the season started
8560623 it feels almost like high school all over again it is exciting to have youngsters looking up to you and asking you questions and i really like that role
8560624 you cant think about the pressure of the situation at all
8560625 i feel confident in our defense and our offense and hopefully we can live up to the expectations
8560626 not having much experience just puts a chip on our shoulder and we will play every down play by play and we will be alright
8560627 i am really excited because i finally have a chance to go at it after waiting for a long time
8560628 i think i had a really good fall camp i had a lot of stuff i needed to work on but it seems it had a good turn out everything seemed to work out for the best and i am ready to step into the starting lineup
8560629 i need to make sure i play my part and i dont do too much and stay in position
8560630 i just need to make sure everything is all right on my end and not worry about doing stuff for everybody else
8560631 were gonna miss antione and wilrey a lot but devin and marquis are very good dbs
8560632 theyre very quick theyre very fast just like antione and wilrey they just dont have as much experience as wil and antione but i have faith in them and trust them a lot
8560633 robert brings a physical and mental maturity for a young player whos far beyond his years so that obviously gives him a great opportunity to contribute
8560634 hes a competitive kid he wants to be great and he works everyday were moving him around to a couple of different positions and we feel like hell bring some versatility to our defense
8560635 coming out here everyday and practicing with the players and team is great i cant complain
8560636 my expectations are just coming out here and being wherever the coaches need me to be and working hard and playing hard every time i touch the field and make the team better
8560637 this is my last year and you know it is kind of weird when you realize it and it just kind of hits you that you dont have any time left
8560638 i am working as hard as i ever have i just have to make sure that i am ready to go each game right now i feel like i am doing the best i ever have with the offense
8560639 tuitama has been coming along real good hes the pistol starter of our offense
8560640 without tuitama and the o line we wouldnt have anything
8560641 thats just me if people get rough with me im gonna get rough back
8560642 once they know youre soft theyre going to keep coming at you wrong i want the defense to know or whoever im playing against to know that im not going to back down
8560643 i know the whole offense can provide this year so i know were going to go to whos open and get the play done
8560644 im really excited i couldnt care less about what other people have to say
8560645 theyre a bunch of good guys theyve worked very hard this summer and their progress was really really good ill tell you were gonna be ready
8560646 oh gosh hes got it all man hes got the quickness the explosiveness the strength hell take care of business
8560647 i dont know if a lot of people have been paying attention but our defensive line is very tough
8560648 brooks reed lolomana mikaele ricky elmore daundre reed earl i like them all
8560649 they play hard every snap they dont take a snap off
8560650 i dont lie and hold myself accountable i drank some beers tonight
8560651 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

8560700 we had a lot of feedback from the 2004 convention that activities during the day were pretty boring but that the bloggers enjoyed hanging out together
8560701 so we thought lets create a zone where we can do that once we started down that road the interest skyrocketed
8560702 i think four years ago in boston there was nothing just a conference room with a couple of crates of beer and wifi
8560703 democratic national comittee chairman howard dean told us yesterday that we had better access than the mainstream media and i actually think thats true
8560704 were getting access to the podium to the floor there really arent many places that are off limits
8560705 a lot of people find the traditional media very stale very programmed
8560706 our readers are looking for something more than a 30 second soundbite on important issues
8560707 blogs have become important because theres been a declining trust in the mainstream media particularly in the lack of hard hitting reporting in the run up to the iraq war
8560708 that combined with the new availability of tools that allows anyone to publish and create their own audience which didnt exist before
8560709 i had to take my paid time off to come here
8560710 ive pretty much exhausted my allowance for the whole year im going to have to take unpaid leave for the rest of the year if i want to travel but fortunately my employer is supportive

8560719 carville told her he had some inside news the kerry campaign was going to challenge the provisional ballots in ohio perhaps up to 250 000 of them i dont agree with it carville said im just telling you thats what theyre talking about
8560720 matalin went to cheney to report you better tell the president cheney told her
8560721 somebody in authority needed to get in touch with j kenneth blackwell the republican secretary of state in ohio who would be in charge of any challenge to the provisional votes
8560722 most timid most narrow minded and prejudiced or who cling most tenaciously to the exclusive class interest
8560723 what may frighten some americans about barack obama is his very excellence his fiercest critics have so far had little else to go on
8560724 but if he is truly that scary why is it so necessary to lie about him
8560725 if the real truth about him is so frightening why is it so necessary for someone like daniel pipes to ingeniously resuscitate the lie that obama is a muslim
8560726 if the actual facts are so damning why was it so necessary for fox and others to pump up the packet of hardbound fictions called obama nation a miserable book whose manipulative distribution propelled it to a debut at the top of the new york times best seller list
8560727 there will be those for whom race is the deciding issue but i believe their numbers are few for many more well meaning and tolerant people i believe the reason is fear it is fear of the unknown but not only fear of the unknown obama
8560728 i believe that the real fear is finding out what lies behind the big lies of george bush and more ominously by far dick cheney karl rove and a host of other neo con artists
8560729 this foreign visitor doesnt believe that this election is about race it is about the difficulty and the sacrifice involved in changing course acknowledging error actively working for a better common future
8560730 it is a battle over the kind of complacency and fear of change that put into the oval office its most underqualified occupant in living memory perhaps that is how the joke statistics should be understood and taken seriously
8560731 but what the foreign visitor finds the most frightening the most dangerous is the voter who after eight years of abject catastrophe continues to pray
8560732 you may not like barack obama but the alternative is a heck of a lot worse
8560733 why is no one talking about the fact mccain appears to be suffering from the early stages of some kind of dementia
8560734 look we live in arizona in our home we vacation in two condos the rest is investment property some of which belongs to my wife and some of which we own jointly any other questions
8560735 all would be well with the republic if only these loathesome left liberal democrats would stop destroying the democratic party i once admired and might even have joined
8560736 flamers tell themselves their enemies are so vicious they have to be vicious too
8560737 the democrats are in danger of doing to obama what they did to their last two nominees gore and kerry burying authentic individuals under a layer of prefab themes
8560738 immense is the army of michelangelos trying to sculpture the melted marshmallow of kerrys core and tumultuous is the cry of the strategists and loud are the furies of the campaign but in the center there is a silence for in the beginning all was vacuum and a void
8560739 shut them out he turned his back on the universe of geniuses and stayed true to his core identity at the core obamas best message has always been this he is unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics he is in tune with a new era he is authentically the sort of person who emerges in a multicultural globalized age he is therefore naturally in step with the problems that will confront us in the years to come
8560740 is the most split personality politician in the country today on the one hand there is dr barack the high minded niebuhr quoting speechifier who spent this past winter thrilling the scarlett johansson set and feeling the fierce urgency of now but then on the other side theres fast eddie obama the promise breaking tough minded chicago pol whod throw you under the truck for votes
8560741 unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics
8560742 and when democrats are nervous all the santa monica machiavellis emerge from their fund raisers offering words of wisdom and the subtext of the advice being offered this year is that barack obama should really be someone else
8560743 so long was the line of approaching volvos that it was visible from outer space yet still the message was not honed king kerry still did equivocate hedge and reverse of flip flops there were more than a few he still did velcro his principles upon the cathedral door and change them by the hour
8560744 on the one hand obama did sell out the primary cause of his professional life all for a tiny political advantage if hell sell that out what wont he sell out on the other hand global affairs aint beanbag if were going to have a president who is going to go toe to toe with the likes of vladimir putin maybe it is better that he should have a ruthlessly opportunist fast eddie obama lurking inside
8560745 the power of our example more than the example of our power
8560746 im not so sure that vladimir putin admires the power of our example
8560747 ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that mccain is a good man who happens to be out of step with the times ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that a multipolar world demands a softer international touch ill put a plus down when a speaker says the old free market policies worked fine in the 20th century but no longer seem to be working today these are arguments that reinforce obamas identity as a 21st century man
8560748 will have to pave the way between the contradictory viewpoints of her hosts in jerusalem
8560749 i am here now on state matters state matters mean that things are adjusted and readjusted there are some reports that our journey to brazil has been cancelled it is not cancelled it is just readjusted
8560750 brazil is a very important country to us and we intend to keep that our respect for them remains very strong and our inability to come on this trip does not in any way affect our respect for them and they are looking forward to when the president will make the trip

8560775 the plan is to consult with court managers to determine in each court what is the best way we can achieve the savings we need while having the least impact on public access to the courts
8560776 the kinds of questions were asking are should all the courts be closed the same half day each week does it make sense to have some courts closed at different times were pretty much into that kind of micro planning at the moment
8560777 its definitely not going to be to anybodys advantage to close it everything will just get backed up i dont think its such a good idea
8560778 more recent statistics have already indicted a more or less abrupt change in the number of people afflicted
8560779 in the past two years anti retroviral drugs have become available for free meaning some hiv positive people previously unknown to the authorities are now being reported
8560780 four years ago youtube hadnt been founded yet now it will have booths at each convention to help delegates and bloggers upload videos taken on the floor or at events around town
8560781 its an amazing opportunity for us you dont get all these people in one place but every four years
8560782 whats interesting about this to me is i have never seen the campaign that is idle if you will during the other candidates nominating convention have as much of an impact before and i think it owes something to the phenomenon of these what we call ads and i guess in some broad sense they are but what they really are are internet videos that are being published to the internet and they spread around in this day and age very quickly and are probably as good as paid ads and i guess theres some paid advertising going on but this is wouldnt you say carl from your experience that this has been remarkable the extent to which the mccain camp has succeeded in intervening so to speak in this convention
8560783 there does seem to be a growing problem in some unexpected areas such as parts of the outlying rather than just urban areas
8560784 a great deal of effort is being made to do something that does not fit
8560785 ik sta hier als een trotse moeder een trotse democraat een trotse senator van new york een trotse amerikaanse en een trotse aanhanger van barack obama
8560786 maakte je alleen deel uit van mijn campagne vanwege mij of was het voor die marinier die moeder voor alle mensen in dit land die zich onzichtbaar voelen
8560787 er is een journalistiek inhoudelijke reden voor deze obama serie het is voor het eerst in de amerikaanse geschiedenis dat een van de twee partijen een zwarte presidentskandidaat aanwijst
8560788 de wereld draait door begint een week later en er was een gat dat we moesten vullen
8560789 ik zal op de conventie voor obama stemmen maar alleen als hillary clinton haar afgevaardigden vrijgeeft
8560790 sinds 1850 heeft ons district nog nooit een democraat verkozen maar dit jaar kan het haar tegenkandidaat is maar in de helft van het district echt bekend en carol voert campagne op groene themas zelf hangt ze haar was buiten te drogen zomer n winter daarom is haar symbool een wasknijper ik zal die elke dag aan mijn toegangspas klemmen
8560791 in november zal ik natuurlijk voor obama en biden stemmen wie dat niet doet is geen echte democraat biden is een goede keus als vicepresident maar hillary was beter geweest ze brengt 18 miljoen gegarandeerde stemmen mee
8560792 ik ben op weg naar denver om te kijken hoe het er aan toegaat donderdag ga ik naar de toespraak van obama
8560793 mijn bedrijf is overgenomen door hewlett packard dus nu zit ik in over mijn baan
8560794 ik was een aanhanger van kucinich tot die het opgaf en nu ben ik voor obama dat vind ik ook een heel goede vent maar wel meer een politicus hij weegt zijn woorden en zijn meningen anders kan hij ook niet gekozen worden donderdag in het stadion verwacht ik een inspirerende toespraak en ze zullen wel willen dat we voor ons kaartje iets terug doen langs de deuren gaan of mensen bellen
8560795 zoiets heb ik nog nooit gedaan ik ben nogal verlegen maar dit keer overweeg ik het het zijn belangrijke verkiezingen de wereld heeft

8560827 this can only be positive because the students will know how they are doing
8560828 advising intervention supplementary instruction and other forms of academic support to these students
8560829 this will alert the advisers and those students will get a little more intrusive advising and will provide help in terms of support and assistance
8560830 at other colleges and universities where they instituted the midterm grading student retention increased
8560831 my concern was this was not well planned we cant change the syllabi the day before class start

8560840 the college of engineering is fortunate to receive such an transformative gift of half a million as part of this pledge with the primary intent of renovating our seminar room to be a much more appropriate venue for seminars conference and other panel discussions
8560841 ssoe will help us design the space to be the kind of venue which will allow for active engagement between speakers and visitors in addition they are providing cash contributions both from the company and through the employees to make this possible
8560842 i think we did an assessment recently and almost 150 alumni work at ssoe 80 or so are from the college of engineering
8560843 for example we hold an annual distinguished lecture series which mr and mrs samborn started in this college we got a special visitor from duke university henry petrowski thanks to ssoes special contribution
8560844 they are one of the most impacting contributors for the college of engineering because their contributions are multidimensional
8560845 ssoe inc is engaged in one too many ways to describe at the same time and everywhere they go theyre making a difference in the life of our students and college

8560855 astounded last week to find out that councillors had deemed their school playing fields the most viable place to build a new primary school
8560856 st columbas parent council have many concerns about these proposals
8560857 to lose five or six acres of the schools playing fields would be a massive loss to the school and of great detriment to the pupils at a time when we are trying to encourage our children to play sports and keep fit
8560858 there are also major concerns regarding the increased congestion on woodmill road
8560859 the entrance is hazardous at the moment and the school has tried for several years to have a drop off point put in place but to no avail
8560860 the new proposals suggest almost another 500 pupils being dropped off at the primary school in very close proximity to both st columbas and woodmill
8560861 the new school is expected to be open by 2010
8560862 this would mean almost two years of construction work around the bus park
8560863 eighty per cent of st columbas high school pupils travel to and from school by bus and access to the proposed site would be via the bus park
8560864 locating the new primary school within woodmill high school could help boost their decreasing school roll and safety wise would be a more favourable option as this site could be accessed clear from woodmills own car and bus park
8560865 the parent council feel due consideration has not been given to the implications on st columbas and it would be easy to assume it is a done deal
8560866 indeed there is no mention of the effect on pupils and future pupils at st columbas
8560867 while the parent council fully understand the need for another primary school in the area they are disappointed and angry at the lack of consultation with parents
8560868 the staff and pupils of st columbas were informed of the proposals last week and yet work has already started on the playing fields to test the ground
8560869 because the kids there are bused to crossgates primary the parents were saying theyve not even been consulted about the new primary
8560870 the council seems to be run to suit the officers policies are being presented as the only option and the elected councillors are just going along with it

8560874 of course people are apprehensive there is always apprehension when you dont know
8560875 when you dont know you have lots of doubts i see this appointment as an opportunity im going to have a great chance to meet new people and a great chance to have an even stronger relationships with the people i know respect and like a lot
8560876 i dont see it as a challenge at all i am the new kid on the block
8560877 as of right now i can tell that she is not a pushover and she will stand up to ridiculous comments made either by the administration or by us
8560878 listen and get a complete picture of the college that she can report back to the administration and at the same time she would work with everybody in an open way to further the interest of the college
8560879 i think that it was a good decision for dr lee to leave that position
8560880 i cant imagine that this new person will be any worse i have faith the university picked a decent person to lead the college of arts and sciences
8560881 the basic skills that are necessary for college administrators to possess
8560882 people skills and assertive communication are the most important skills for the new dean to have
8560883 in my opinion the former dean really needed to grow in those areas
8560884 standing up for the values and goals of that department
8560885 why would the students want to come here if they dont have the support
8560886 i hope we can begin together the faculty and me to reach out more into the strategic plan that the college has and the strategic plan the university has and to begin to develop the actions and plans that will take us many steps further in our striving for excellence
8560887 i am delighted to be back and i feel that i never really left
8560888 my concern is that raw sewage knows no boundaries sewage spreads and i have concerns that it could spread to other beaches in the neighbourhood
8560889 im not saying that its affecting silver sands but theres a potential for it to affect the beach if the officials dont get their act together this must be attended to theres just no room for people to delay
8560890 there are a number of urgent health and safety issues stemming from this matter not to mention infrastructure and environmental impacts as well
8560891 one resident stated it was apparent that children had been building castles and digging around in the drainage channels now running onto the beach black sands
8560892 this has the dangerous potential to impact on local tourism in the long term as well
8560893 scottish water recently performed a cctv survey on the immediate network and will now analyse the network outside of the immediate locality to find a solution
8560894 i know that it is an issue of some local controversy
8560895 but while im the secretary of state for scotland i dont have any planning powers
8560896 the structure plan is at the scottish executive being considered and it would be entirely inappropriate of me to be commenting on its use
8560897 i am very impressed with the way the developers have liaised with the community and consulted them about what they want to see
8560898 a sustainable future for these parts will have to be bought into by the community and cant be landed here as if it has come from some other planet
8560899 my principal purpose was to see what could be done with former mod land
8560900 i have been very impressed by the way in which they have cleaned it up as it was heavily contaminated
8560901 im sure most people locally thought that it would never be cleared
8560902 not only can you see whats been done to clean it up but you can see a part of the site that can be developed in such a way to bring jobs
8560903 im aware that its a reduced service and that the current operator feels that it cant operate it economically
8560904 im told that there are discussions going on with an alternative operator but i dont know the details of that and nor would i expect to as these things are commercially confidential
8560905 certainly as a gateway to europe this is a very important part of scotland and it would be a pity to lose that service
8560906 we are praying to the river goddess and offering her blood since only she can help us
8560907 efforts are needed now to adapt the current price of the vaccines so they meet what individual countries can afford
8560908 the solution may be tiered pricing according to gross national income per capita and according to the scale of country efforts
8560909 owning a nikon camera doesnt make you a photographer it makes you a nikon owner
8560910 i live up pretty high so you have to watch the wind
8560911 with the gladioli i always bring them in as soon as the first bud is in bloom and that is usually about three days before the show and that seems to work well
8560912 i am very pleased i got them all to bloom at the same time and managed to get them the same colour
8560913 the force 11 winds last week meant some people did not manage to get their tomatoes ripe in time
8560914 then we had the torrential rain and some people left it too late to bring in their blooms and the dahlias and roses were badly hit
8560915 taking all that into consideration i think it has been a great show
8560916 it is very encouraging to see the isle of wight maintain the upward momentum we saw last year when we broke the 50 per cent barrier for the first time
8560917 we are on the right road and that needs to continue over the next year
8560918 it is pleasing to see the isle of wight has improved from last year and our aim now must be to continue this trend on to 2009 and beyond

8560924 we will audit the performance of every department and see if they have adequately complied with their work programs if not we will have to find out why and how they used the funds appropriated to them under the 2008 gaa
8560925 if in case we determine during the course of our audit that a department did not perform as expected the house will either recommend a budget cut or demand a policy change to ensure adequate compliance on the executives work programs next year
8560926 we should evaluate the extent of the implementation of eo 366 because this may be in conflict with the proposed ssl iii as the increase in personnel service spending represents a sizeable portion of 30 5 percent in the proposed 2009 gaa
8560927 nonetheless i am fully behind the proposal of secretary andaya in the wake of the global economic crunch
8560928 the risk of where this whole structure inside of glassware of gas bottles of rubber tubes where a naked flame could be near them and activate them just shows how stupid these people are
8560929 the chemicals concerned are subject to explosiveness and the smell of the putridness of this type of material can harm people

8561013 they are pushing all of us older players to get better knowing that we have competition its not just a handed starting spot they are competing against us pretty well practices are competitive which is good having more players compared to last year helped it be more competitive so we can play more six on six instead of one sided drills

8561053 i grew up in the early 90s so i had a lot of exposure to grunge and that had some influence on me
8561054 ko ko sang in the church and a lot of her sound comes from listening to old soul and country artists
8561055 the bands we tour with give us that pop influence
8561056 a lot of our music has a country and a pop vibe to make it popular but at the heart of it its all about rock n roll
8561057 the whole project was inspired by us and our relationship the album and the artwork was important to us because its really intricate and visually creative
8561058 we still believe in the album as an artistic expression and this is one of the best things weve ever done

8561063 im not afraid of that i did what i did and ill face the music if i have to
8561064 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
8561065 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
8561066 our aim is to raise awareness on the benefits and risks of high doses of vitamins and minerals says susan j whiting phd author of the review our understanding of the function of nutrients now goes beyond just prevention of classical deficiency diseases to possible prevention of disease for those people for whom vitamin and mineral supplements are needed we want to assure them that the benefit out weighs the risk
8561067 he is such an interesting person with strong opinions and immense musical talent he does not mince words when he dislikes something but when he talks about music he respects he is an outspoken fan

8561073 obama and the dnc view us as a bunch of hormonal angry and bitter feminists
8561074 its not anger barack obama terrifies us he is not ready to run the country
8561075 sen hillary clinton took to the podium tonight and delivered a resounding speech to the assembled delegates and to americans across the nation as one of the most groundbreaking candidates ever to run for the presidency sen clinton has inspired millions of women and men with her unyielding commitment to the causes that we all care so deeply about and tonight she left no doubt about what we all must do to face the challenges ahead of us unite behind barack obama and present a fully unified democratic party to the country and the world
8561076 it the speech makes a big difference to delegates but the delegates are the party activists
8561077 the question is did it impact the 18 million who voted for her weve seen a 30 percent split off either going to mccain or undecided
8561078 the percentage of clinton voters for mccain has increased since june it should be moving in the opposite direction by now
8561079 the general tone is outrage many dont think hillary really supports him
8561080 people who were anti obama are going to dig in their heels
8561081 you know why because obama has said all along its not going to be cakewalk its not a blow out its going to be tight
8561082 theres a plan theres a strategy and im with it
8561083 no importa cu n mal est n las cosas siempre puedes empeorarlas al mismo tiempo frecuentemente est en tus manos mejorarlas

8561086 it is also a response to observations from foreign investors who pointed out that since the philippine stock market is small they first look at the bigger markets in the morning but by the time they get the opportunity to look at our market the pse is already closing so why bother at all
8561087 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8561088 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8561089 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8561090 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8561091 particularly pleasing given the more challenging operating environment in the first half of this year
8561092 dp world remains committed to expanding its already strong presence in the faster growing emerging economies together with the more mature economies where capacity is constrained
8561093 its particular focus on the east west trade routes via the suez canal and on origin and destination cargo positions it perfectly to capture the long term growth potential evident in these regions
8561094 do i get to go home and just come back in the morning
8561095 i met her and she wanted me to come here on vacation
8561096 i didnt want to come because i come from a big family and i didnt want to leave my family
8561097 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8561098 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8561099 we have no other information available at this time and it may be highly probable that no other information will be released due to the age of the involved individual
8561100 offensive and misleading because it implied that small newsagents were involved in the drugs industry
8561101 the experience of uk police officers was that some criminality had been found in a small number of retail and business outlets
8561102 the eye was reflecting a light but it wasnt just reflecting in one picture but in a few of them i sent her an e mail just saying it was important she have it checked
8561103 it was half joke half protest and lloyds staff usually burst out laughing when i used it
8561104 the duck must have begun to irritate ozzies stomach lining and due to its shape he would not have been able to pass it back out on his own
8561105 we operated to remove the duck and ozzie was back to his usual energetic self in no time
8561106 with the sovcomflot and novoship claims resolved a new chief executive in place and additional non executive directors appointed with the broad skill sets required to assist the company through its next stage of development i believe the time is right for me to retire as chairman of the company

8561113 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
8561114 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but we re the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
8561115 within a few years it s reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctor s office it s a real possibility
8561116 because when you re dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you don t want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesn t get treated and you don t want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so it s really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed
8561117 its getting increasingly difficult hes not coming back to the original spot
8561118 the prospects are not good and they arent getting any better
8561119 the defense attorney asked me if i could make that part of the plea deal
8561120 i wasnt thrilled and of course im not a district attorney and i dont work on all the dealings
8561121 its just frustrating because i think the guy should have got more time but at least he will have this on his record
8561122 weve identified the folks that are very concerned about the bristol bay watershed and the clean water and the fish
8561123 we believe they are savvy people and tired of the rhetoric and the fibs on both sides and the emotion
8561124 to convince people that something evil was going to happen that jobs would be lost and that wasnt the case
8561125 it is for sure the monies being spent on that side did not get reported properly
8561126 in impaired waters like the kenai river it is especially critical that salamatof and other processors comply with the water pollution permit
8561127 discharges from seafood processors can have a large impact in alaskan waters and these permits help to protect these resources
8561128 thats not as many as arlo guthrie who wrote about 7 500 but then hes older than us

8561134 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
8561135 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
8561136 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
8561137 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
8561138 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
8561139 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
8561140 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
8561141 we are pleased to have been able to work with vacci test in field testing their new rapid e coli product vantage foods prides itself on using leading edge technology such as foodchek tm e coli to compliment our best business practices philosophy of distributing the highest quality and safest products to our customers
8561142 our foodchek tm e coli test will have a major impact for both regulatory agencies and meat processors potential food contaminants such as e coli o157 h7 can now be tested on site and identified prior to the end of a production shift foodchek tm e coli eliminates the need for slaughterhouses and meat processors to hold finished products in cold storage until testing can be completed by off site third parties
8561143 this study marks a very important milestone for the prevention of vap in hospitals one of the major benefits of the agento i c silver coated endotracheal tube is that it is the first prevention option available that requires no further action after placement by the healthcare provider
8561144 in developing the agento i c silver coated endotracheal tube bard sponsored the largest randomized controlled trial in the field of vap prevention and we are pleased that the efforts of the independent clinical investigators have been recognized by such a renowned scientific journal publication in jama reflects the quality of their study and significance of their results we look forward to the benefits that the agento i c silver coated endotracheal tube can provide hospitals and clinicians in their efforts to reduce the incidence of vap and improve patients lives

8561147 lack of privacy has serious consequences it fosters making personal health information a commodity that businesses sell and trade in the marketplace
8561148 that would just keep a lot of people busy rewriting regulations that dont guarantee privacy
8561149 many physicians and other health care providers are urging congress to strengthen privacy rights
8561150 lobbying for privacy amendments to key health internet technology bills currently being considered in congress
8561151 congress needs to pass a new law that defines privacy and upholds the precious ethic of consent the new law should guarantee individuals freedom to decide whether to be part of electronic medical record and genetic databases for years to come
8561152 continues to either misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent the certification issue as a primary argument for the introduction of the proposed regulations
8561153 clearly stated since at least march of this year that refusal to perform or refer for abortion would have no bearing on issuance or renewal of provider certification
8561154 issued guidelines that could shape board certification requirements and necessitate a doctor to perform abortions to be considered competent
8561155 hhs is using to create the illusion that providers rights are under vicious attack when in reality the regulations are the offense blatantly threatening our reproductive freedoms particularly for uninsured and low income women
8561156 attempting to pass off his new regulation as protecting health care providers who for reasons of conscience dont want to take part in abortion services
8561157 schooled in the fine print the regulation might be described as a love letter to extremists
8561158 leavitt does not claim that these laws are inadequate he does not point to any violations of them he seems to want us to believe that he is merely underscoring longstanding laws
8561159 i f leavitts intent is as broad as his broadly worded regulation to suggest your right to health care all health care will be determined by the sensitivities of nearly every person in a white smock and even perhaps others your doctor may not have a problem giving you that prescription but will the pharmacist fill it and if so will the pro life cashier ring it up women have had to run an obstacle course to get reproductive health care in recent years if we leave it to leavitt the number of obstacles will grow

8561163 going back to 1999 john mccain did an interview with the san francisco chronicle saying that overturning roe v wade would not make any sense because then women would have to have illegal abortions

8561172 getting the most from nursing school a guide to becoming a nurse
8561173 i wrote this book because nursing school is extremely challenging for even the most resourceful students
8561174 the book is aimed at helping students to acquire the knowledge skills and attitudes they will need to become clinically competent and caring nurses
8561175 i believe that helping students who have the potential to become great nurses will not only improve the profession but will also improve the nations healthcare system
8561176 i hope to provide these talented individuals the tools to get the most out of nursing school and to become excellent care providers policy makers educators and researchers
8561177 the asteroid that caused the extensive damage was much smaller than we had thought
8561178 that such a small object can do this kind of destruction suggests that smaller asteroids are something to consider their smaller size indicates such collisions are not as improbable as we had believed
8561179 we should be making more efforts at detecting the smaller ones than we have till now
8561180 we no longer have to make the same simplifying assumptions because present day supercomputers allow us to do things with high resolution in 3 d everything gets clearer as you look at things with more refined tools
8561181 but it was caused by a far smaller asteroid unfortunately its not a complete wash in terms of the potential hazard because there are more smaller asteroids than larger ones

8561205 were not saying therefore that people must stop burning it try to reduce exposure to it

8561216 everything is on the line for women in this election
8561217 you would think in 2008 that would be a no brainer
8561218 we cant afford more of the same votes that deny women their equal rights
8561219 women are pretty good at lists and writing things down and checking them off and getting things done
8561220 we decided to bring everyone together to focus on what we know is the core in our gut in our heart which are the issues affecting our families the future of the country
8561221 dont think that our work is over if we elect obama

8561227 it was the scariest moment of my life without a shadow of a doubt

8561251 there were a few players who just didnt perform to what we expected of them this year
8561252 too many of them appeared in a comfort zone so we need to work out what the right direction is now for the club there have been a few players who have expressed a desire to come to manly so there are some tough decisions ahead
8561253 theres things that have happened this season that i havent been happy about and well address those in the next few weeks
8561254 its been a successful season but if we want to go to the next level we need to be ruthless off the field as well as on it
8561255 its fair to say there will be a degree of re building for next year
8561256 they warringah will be a first round casualty in the finals whoever they play will be too good for them
8561257 teams like easts will put plenty of points on them i dont even think the rats have been playing that well this season not as good as the sides in the top four
8561258 those sides will dominate them especially in the forwards thats what we plan to do and then let our backs do all the damage
8561259 they warringah have nothing special in the backline bar mark gerrard
8561260 they can talk all they want well play them on the field
8561261 we are just focused on the game not on what goes on before
8561262 teams like sydney uni gordon and randwick have just got so much depth in their side
8561263 i wish the help had reached us on time that way at least my children could have been safe
8561264 my child is so ill i cannot do a thing about it i wonder what i did wrong that my child must suffer
8561265 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8561266 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8561267 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8561268 i am honored to be here tonight to support barack obama
8561269 and to warm up the crowd for joe biden though as youll soon see he doesnt need any help from me i love joe biden and america will too
8561270 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8561271 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8561272 in the end my candidate didnt win but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8561273 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8561274 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8561275 i think its very important for barack obama to win for bill clinton and his legacy
8561276 was finally forced to testify that sen obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8561277 president clinton was a forceful advocate for democratic partisanship but what he fails to recognize is that the problem in washington is not the republicans or democrats in congress the problem is that people arent following john mccains lead to work together to solve americas problems
8561278 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8561279 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8561280 the campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8561281 in the end my candidate didnt win but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8561282 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8561283 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8561284 we see that humanity that strength and our future in barack and michelle obama and their beautiful children
8561285 she didnt want to be seen as bills third term
8561286 he was in a rage over how they used him
8561287 he was not used to the 24 7 news cycle and people with cell phones recording what he said at every stop
8561288 but you cant blame bill clinton for the loss at end of the day he was a huge plus
8561289 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8561290 like her i want all of you to support barack obama in november
8561291 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president
8561292 will you sit down weve got to get on with the show
8561293 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8561294 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8561295 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8561296 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8561297 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8561298 president clinton was a forceful advocate for democratic partisanship but what he fails to recognize is that the problem in washington is not the republicans or democrats in congress the problem is that people arent following john mccains lead to work together to solve americas problems
8561299 general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev tear down this wall

8561301 these republican leaders have not been content with attacks on me or my wife or on my sons no not content with that they now include my little dog fala well of course i dont resent attacks and my family doesnt resent attacks but fala does resent them you know fala is scotch and his scotch soul was furious he has not been the same dog since
8561302 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8561303 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8561304 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8561305 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8561306 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing
8561307 because there was no platform upon which they could stand
8561308 grew up well polished by gentlemanly pursuits he would ride to the hounds drive fast fly airplanes he knew good clothes fine horses the newest dance steps

8561329 to study political change and unrest in latin america was canceled abruptly after the program was revealed in the chilean press

8561339 our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime
8561340 or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii and korea we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
8561341 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
8561342 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
8561343 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
8561344 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence the number of contract employees now exceeds the cias full time workforce of 17 500 contractors make up more than half the workforce of the cias national clandestine service formerly the directorate of operations which conducts covert operations and recruits spies abroad
8561345 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures in 2006 the nsa was unable to analyze much of the information it was collecting as a result more than 90 percent of the information it was gathering was being discarded without being translated into a coherent and understandable format only about 5 percent was translated from its digital form into text and then routed to the right division for analysis
8561346 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
8561347 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
8561348 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993

8561359 his restaurant dragon city has been closed since the attack
8561360 with the economy the way it is the restaurant remaining closed and all the expenses from the hospital we just thought someone should help this family
8561361 when we heard about this attack our hearts just went out to him and his family
8561362 five dollars is such a small amount of money for most of us but it could do so much good to help this neighbor of ours and member of the business community get back on his feet
8561363 you cant imagine something like that happening to somebody who wouldnt hurt anyone
8561364 he was trying to live the american dream raising a family working a lot of hours delivering the orders at the restaurant he owns whats more american than that this shouldnt happen to someone like that
8561365 you have to look at the ads on the last fm page while you are listening

8561371 you didnt do anything wrong here have a wonderful life matt loved football just as much as you do
8561372 ive got sandbags coming and were trying to head this off
8561373 my place is back there a block or so and its safe he said
8561374 i just came down because i was worried about these people i knew it rained hard last night but i didnt know it could get this bad
8561375 saying its the worst well thats sort of relative anyone who had to evacuate probably could say it was the worst at their place
8561376 when i got up this morning it was pretty high it was covering the fire hydrants
8561377 the fire department and police were here and i asked them if i could get a ride to work if the water hadnt gone down because i couldnt get out of my driveway
8561378 well lose him now for the next two games so that is a little disappointing but you have to live with that when you have internationals
8561379 its a great problem to have and thats probably why we havent used neale fenn as much in the last few weeks as hes been carrying a knock
8561380 we knew kalonas would be going so i didnt want to aggravate that and have fenn missing for the next few games
8561381 kalonas english is okay its not brilliant you have to be slow with him but hes starting to call people now and getting used to names
8561382 the first couple of weeks we left him alone put him on the bench and gave him time to introduce himself in a couple of games but now he wants to play
8561383 a tough reliable and totally genuine horse like royal shakespeare should be celebrated not castigated
8561384 i would have thought he epitomised what the order of merit should be about so therefore i was deeply disappointed by the unnecessary reaction from this committee
8561385 its particularly galling as his injury he is currently recovering from a double fracture to a bone at the back of his knee at kempton was caused because he was trying too hard
8561386 why not give the cash and the trophy to paul nicholls yard at the start of the season that should help to attract a new sponsor
8561387 it would save all the nasty competitive stuff after all the very last thing we need is another super tough horse from a small yard winning again do we
8561388 hes spoony in charge of giving us some cool chilling inspirational stuff
8561389 you have to get the balance right between being intense and being relaxed that is key i want to prepare whoever needs to be prepared for friday morning
8561390 i think well pay more attention to detail than them the americans have the attitude that they are all great players and they plonk them in and see what happens
8561391 of course they can all play well but there is a mystery about the ryder cup an x factor
8561392 we are helping michael as he deals with some personal issues and he has the full support of everyone at the club
8561393 we would ask that his privacy and that of his family is respected at this time and the club will not be commenting further on this matter
8561394 nobody is breaking away and we have to go down there to get a positive result
8561395 hes won twice this year his form has been very good in recent weeks and hes played on five ryder cups and had four winning teams and hes a natural partner to lee westwood
8561396 if you had everybody picking i think clarke would be a lock but obviously nick could see different reasons but if i was picking id be picking darren
8561397 darren carries stature into the ryder cup which is very important when you tee it up on the first tee you want your opposition standing there and feeling that theyre coming up against somebody who has a bit of stature darren has that and monty has that too
8561398 the guy has played eight ryder cups has never lost a singles match and hes due a consideration
8561399 we are looking for a run in this competition and that will obviously mean a lot more games this season thats why were trying to build a squad that would be able to cope with that
8561400 if you look at a side in many ways similar to ourselves last season everton i dont think they would have been able to cope with the size of the squad that we had last year
8561401 certainly if wed been in evertons position with a run in europe it would have been an impossibility to have done that
8561402 now were trying to get a bit stronger both numerically but more importantly in terms of a bit of quality so that from a thursday to a sunday we are able to go into major games looking quite strong
8561403 that is something you could do with the best will in the world we could feel quite strong next monday and feel weve done our utmost and still end up in the scenario that west ham had last year the number of injuries they sustained would have been hard for anybody to have kept going
8561404 that can happen to the best of teams but you want to try and make as much provision as you can and thats what the last few days of the window are about in terms of looking to try and strengthen
8561405 we see the slowdown in the u s market as a fundamental change

8561410 saudara yakin anwar akan melaksanakan segala komitmennya terhadap perjuangan islam jika dia berjaya jadi pm
8561411 kalau anwar yakin dengan perjuangan pas sebagai sebuah gerakan islam atau parti politik islam mengapa dia sendiri tidak menyertai pas bersama ustaz fadzil
8561412 cuba saudara bayangkan imej anwar menyertai umno dalam keadaan abim hebat menentangnya
8561413 tapi bagi saya imej perjuangan anwar sebenarnya lebih buruk lagi
8561414 semasa anwar bersama sama pemimpin pas mengatur strategi pilihanraya umum 1982 dia telah pun bersedia menyertai umno secara aktif maksud saya sebenarnya anwar sendiri mengakuinya beliau cuma mengumumkan secara rasmi bahawa dia aktif berjuang melalui umno pada mac 1982 maknanya apa ini bukankah seperti ular berkepala dua
8561415 begitu juga semasa anwar mengetuai jawatankuasa khas yang membantah cadangan pindaan akta pertubuhan yang mewakili 19 pertubuhan anwar sudah menjadi ahli umno ketika itu tetapi berpura pura bertindak sebagai jaguh memperjuangkan kebebasan dan keadilan
8561416 semuanya sudah berlalu saya rasa tidak ada manfaatnya kita bincang masalah itu
8561417 itu pandangan saudara bagi saya masih ramai orang pas yang mengharapkan anwar dapat berbuat sesuatu untuk kepentingan islam dan tidak kurang yang beranggapan anwar orang kita dalam umno saya risau pas akan tertipu dengan igauannya itu
8561418 itu tidak penting dan kalau ada pun memang sukar hendak dibuktikan orang pas tidak akan mengaku mereka masih mengharapkan anwar tapi dalam hati mereka siapa tahu tengok sajalah isu kerugian bank negara hampir rm16 000 juta mengapa pas tidak manfaatkan isu itu dengan sebaik mungkin yang hendak saya timbulkan anwar memang sejak awal sejak dilantik presiden abim darah dagingnya disemangati umno bukannya pas
8561419 bukankah anwar tidak sertai pas kerana katanya pemimpin pas tidak dapat meyakinkan dirinya dalam banyak isu dasar dan pas tidak mempunyai program untuk melayakkan parti itu memimpin negara
8561420 itu alasan tidak masuk akal kenapa pula pemimpin pas mesti membuktikan kepada anwar siapa anwar untuk menerima penghormatan sebesar itu dan sekiranya benar anwar pemimpin berwibawa anwarlah yang merintis jalan menjulangkan pas sebagai sebuah parti islam yang memimpin ummah bukan menanti orang lain membuktikannya lagipun mengapa pula anwar mengarahkan ustaz fadzil ustaz abdul hadi dan lain lain masuk pas sepatutnya anwar sendiri bersama membuktikan kemampuan pas itu
8561421 takkan saudara tak baca harakah ustaz nakhaei jawab siddiq fadil mengenai sikap abim terhadap pembabitan ahlinya dalam politik saya rasa pertengahan tahun 1988
8561422 masa itu saya tidak bekerja dengan harakah maksud saya saya berhenti sekejap
8561423 saya ingin membetulkan salah satu fakta sejarah yang cuba diputarbelitkan untuk tujuan yang meragukan mumutarkan fakta sejarah adalah tidak wajar walaupun ini dilakukan oleh pemimpin pertubuhan islam
8561424 dengan terlebih dahulu menyatakan hormat kepada presiden abim sahabat saya yang dikasihi saudara siddiq fadil saya ingin menjelaskan mengenai kenyataan beliau berhubung dengan pelepasan beberapa orang tokoh abim untuk menyertai parti politik
8561425 menurut beliau orang abim masuk bidang politik bukan satu yang ganjil sesapa saja yang ingin aktif dalam politik harus meletakkan jawatan agar dengan itu abim tetap independent dan bebas dalam erti tidak dipengaruhi dan diseret dalam politik kepartian
8561426 seterusnya beliau berkata abim memberi kebebasan kepada ahli ahlinya untuk berperanan di mana mereka sesuai dan berkesan
8561427 gambaran yang diberikan oleh beliau mengenai penglibatan bekas tokoh tokoh abim di dalam politik seolah olahnya abim langsung tidak mempunyai rencana dan langsung tidak mempunyai peranan di dalam melepaskan bekas tokoh tokoh abim itu untuk menentukan parti politik mana yang harus disertai
8561428 saya masih ingat lagi penyertaan fadzil noor syed ibrahim haji abdul hadi awang dan saya sendiri adalah perencanaan dan keputusan abim kami tidak mengambil keputusan bersendirian
8561429 keputusan itu bukanlah dari sikap abim memberikan kebebasan dan sikapnya menyerahkan keputusan kepada pilihan dan keputusan yang difikirkan sendiri oleh setiap orang daripada kami
8561430 penglibatan kami di dalam pas ialah setelah berlaku kekalahan pas di kelantan pas di waktu yang sama terkeluar dari barisan nasional banyak kalangan pensyarah pensyarah universiti yang menganggotai pas terpaksa meletakkan jawatan kerana terikat dengan akta universiti
8561431 pak natsir tokoh islam yang terkenal di indonesia menulis surat kepada presiden abim di waktu itu ialah encik anwar ibrahim
8561432 kerana pak natsir tahu kehancuran wadah politik islam indonesia meninggalkan akibat buruk kepada umat islam di indonesia ia menekankan kepentingan peranan abim untuk menyelamatkan pas istilah pemindahan darah adalah istilah yang digunakan oleh pak natsir
8561433 encik anwar ibrahim bersemangat untuk menyelamatkan pas dan akur dengan pandangan pak natsir
8561434 presiden abim tentu saja masih ingat pertanyaan saya yang tidak dijawab oleh pemimpin pemimpin abim di waktu itu
8561435 hanya ada dua kemungkinan daripada kenyataan itu pertama abim menyesal dengan peranan dan keputusannya yang lalu untuk menghantar pemimpin pemimpinnya ke dalam pas lalu cuba menutup sejarah itu dengan memutarbelitkannya atau abim berubah sikapnya terhadap pas dan tidak langsung seperti dahulu
8561436 kedua abim menyusun kembali sikapnya terhadap parti parti politik dan tidak lagi bersimpati dengan parti politik islam dengan itu menjelaskan kebenaran kritik kritik bahawa abim telah berubah sikap sekarang ini
8561437 mr anwar would be the logical successor as there was no pas leader of sufficient stature to rebuild the shattered party after its dismal performance in kelantan state
8561438 tetapi sebagai pertubuhan dakwah yang berlandaskan islam sudah tentulah abim menggalakkan ahli ahlinya memilih corak partai yang jelas matlamat keislamannya
8561439 no alternative but to give him his party and his government my full support
8561440 i have not resigned my principles in entering politics through umno
8561441 saya mengalu alukan belanjawan ini yang dibentangkan oleh menteri kewangan yang dahulunya menjadi sahabat karib kami dalam angkatan belia islam malaysia
8561442 kemudian beliau sendiri mengepalai jentera daripada pelajar berkempen berhempas pulas
8561443 saya pergi ke desaru tetapi sebelum itu saya hadir di desaru oleh kerana kesuntukan masa pkenj menyewa helikopter saya wallahuaklam tidak tahu yang sewa helikopter itu siapa sehingga saya naik sewa helikopter dibayar setengah oleh pkenj setengahnya dibayar oleh umno johor tetapi apa yang dikatakan oleh ahli yang berhormat dari nilam puri vincent tan yang bayar kalau bercakap di laha yuewkah dimanakah dia tipu begitu ada yang mengangguk ada yang berhormat yang mengangguk ada ulamak macam ulamak pengkalan chepa angguk tiga kali walaupun sumber itu sumber fitnah
8561444 dia anwar kata saya melenting sedangkan dia yang melenting dia kata ulamak jumud tidak apa tetapi kita kata dia lebih kurang tak boleh
8561445 saya tidak mendakwa saya ini ulamak saya hanya menjawab kepada hujah beliau sahaja
8561446 dia maki orang boleh bila saya cakap dia lari kenapa dia lari masa saya bercakap hansard dia tidak baca apakah dewan ini untuk menteri kewangan ataupun untuk wakil rakyat
8561447 saya sudah sabar apa tidak duduk lagi beri peluanglah maki orang boleh saya hendak tanya tidak boleh macam mana
8561448 saya mengaku dalam banyak perkara saya masih jahil tetapi kalau orang yang fikir dia sudah alim kemudian menyerang ini yang menjadi masalah kepada kita saya hendak menggunakan ruang dan kesempatan pada petang ini untuk menjawab tuduhan yang dibuat tetapi ini dia umpamanya helikopter yang diberi oleh vincent tan saya jawab yang tuduh itu wakil parti islam nilam puri bila saya tengok perangai tuhan sahaja yang mengetahui jadi ini yang saya sebut
8561449 yang berhormat dari nilam puri kata saya takut hendak berbahas dengan dia tolong cermin dulu
8561450 saya tahu harakah akan menyerang besar besaran saya tahu pengarang pengarang harakah di belakang boleh dengar dan boleh tulis apa yang dia hendak maki makilah saya tidak peduli
8561451 kalau semasa saya menteri pertanian kata dia menteri lembu dan tikus masa saya menteri kebudayaan ini menteri bola dan tarian masa saya jadi menteri pendidikan menteri tadika dan kelas dewasa sekarang menteri arak dan judi
8561452 menggunakan kata kata yang kesat menghina menunjukkan kebencian yang keterlaluan
8561453 anwar masih mentah mudah mengelabah kuat melatah cepat naik angin dan kadang kadang apabila terdesak hilang kewarasannya

8561489 the basic premise of environmentalism is to leave nature alone capturing and utilizing any source of energy even ones that are supposedly green and renewable will necessarily have some impact on nature and will therefore inevitably be subject to environmentalist attacks and condemnation

8561502 ithaca new york was 1 8 miles under snow and ice just 11 000 years ago
8561503 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab
8561504 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8561505 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8561506 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8561507 unser plan weckt weltweit aufmerksamkeit aber kein kopfsch tteln sondern ernsthaftes interesse
8561508 its on for young and old so bring it on
8561509 its been a total waste of half a million dollars the bottom line is they are in total absolute chaos we dont have a government anymore we have a rabble
8561510 half a million dollars could have bought half a school hall for wheeler heights public school or could have cleared the maintenance backlog at all northern beaches schools
8561511 there are definitely some merits in the proposal but when you weigh up every other factor it is not in the public interest to do it now
8561512 the last time i did cpr was when i was a member of freshwater surf club
8561513 i was a bit worried that i may have had forgotten the basics but thankfully it all came flooding back pretty quickly
8561514 it was a straight forward exercise the instructions were easy to follow
8561515 it is invaluable to have the ability to respond in the appropriate fashion knowing cpr is an important skill everyone should have
8561516 because of the parallel parking along wyatt ave the streetscape is very busy and motorists simply do not notice the upcoming crossing which is poorly marked
8561517 add to that the fact that most road users do not know that they are required to stop at this style of crossing and the result is an accident waiting to happen
8561518 this location needs a permanent crossing as it is used all week both by the school and sports groups who use wyatt ave oval in the evenings and on the weekend
8561519 the federal government needs to put in place legislation that protects children supports parents and does not undermine campaigns to promote healthy lifestyles
8561520 it is a shame that the revised standards have put broadcasters revenue before our childrens health
8561521 a national ban on junk food advertising during childrens tv viewing hours is a sensible first step in tackling childhood obesity

8561524 we got the best outcome for our members with the mergers terms
8561525 when they gave me the job they wanted to turn the company around and weve achieved that

8561527 unfortunately there is only room for one ceo but ive thoroughly enjoyed my time here
8561528 politics was a wonderful part of my life but that chapter is definitely closed im now in business and really enjoying it

8561531 were a political common sense party were not racists or fascists people seem to be coming across to us in large numbers theyre generally fed up with labour the liberal democrats and the conservatives and theyre looking for something new
8561532 the meeting was well attended by people from broadclyst exeter east devon and the surrounding area it was great and we made four new members that evening there will be lots of meetings in the future in this area were growing all the time here which is great youre going to see more about us
8561533 support is very good in devon a lot of people are becoming interested in the bnp now there are migrant workers and a shortage of houses also people are moving from london and the midlands into the westcountry and are very familiar with whats happening devons an area thats looking interesting for us
8561534 four people complain about a meeting from a population of 600 makes a story what about 16 7 of towns population attend bnp meeting now that is a story
8561535 freedom of speech is a fundamental part of democracy without it you have a dictatorship the bnp do not hold secret meetings contact your local branch and you would be welcome to come along
8561536 with the complete implosion of u k i p the british national party is the only party that wish for the united kingdom to re negotiate the treasonous treaty of lisbon and to withdraw from the creeping federalisation of europe they remain our collective last best chance to get rid of a real undemocratic body of trough hogs
8561537 i hope they get it a real party who arent afraid to upset people and actually have a vision
8561538 so you are all happy with paying all these taxes so that immigrants come into our country and claim all our benefits when decent working class people get nothing why do you think so many of us british are emigrating too much political correctness in this world
8561539 bnp are right to target area and yes i hope they do get a seat down here im a member myself and nobody asked me to become a member i called them because i believe in keeping this great country great

8561556 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security

8561560 what we are doing is creating a novel technique to control the architecture of nanoparticles that will remedy many of the problems associated with the application of nanomaterials that are so essential to business sectors such as the aerospace and cosmetics industry
8561561 essentially what we learned how to do was to control the density composition and size of polymers attached to inorganic materials which in turn improves the optical transparency of polymer composites in a sense light can flow freely through the particle by putting grease onto its surface
8561562 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
8561563 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms

8561586 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8561587 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8561588 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south africann president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8561589 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently

8561602 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8561603 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8561604 this speech and the election is not about barack obama its about the american people and the direction we need to go in to get us out of the ditch we are in
8561605 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need

8561670 we know this race is going to be close and we know sen mccain will be making an all out effort to win the state
8561671 this is the festival to get into to present your work
8561672 in 12 years weve championed a large group of artists
8561673 weve consistently given them a platform weve enabled them to find legs
8561674 the arts community in philadelphia becomes part of an international community
8561675 enriches our work here because our work feeds into other experiences
8561676 it creates a lot of buzz in the city and theres an urgency to seeing the pieces
8561677 allows me to see shows at an inexpensive price or a reasonable one and i get to choose from a lot of different dramatic offerings
8561678 the opportunity to see new work its exciting what an amazing arts community
8561679 the idea is to take a chance its not always going to be great and its not always going to be memorable but it is always interesting
8561680 created a vibe for a mainstream audience to see the work we do
8561681 you can feel normal taking a risk and checking out unusual stuff you may not know you already like
8561682 the fringe is a whole other way to get people involved in a conversation about art
8561683 at other festivals i saw that what people really wanted each night was to just be together at a place where they could talk
8561684 to do your own thing thats the spirit of the fringe
8561685 the sophistication and the willingness to push the envelope i find that very attractive
8561686 the most important thing whether youre talking about a business or youre talking about a city is innovation you want to create a climate of innovation
8561687 the shows we make are being seen by the national and international community and taken to theaters and festivals worldwide
8561688 so many of us in philadelphia are cross disciplinary so you might be designing one persons show and performing in another persons
8561689 the festival means pushing ourselves youre encouraged to do risky work to go out on a limb and you get to see a whole range of different people taking risks nick stuccio has given us such an international face

8561697 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8561698 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8561699 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8561700 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you
8561701 you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8561702 together vice president cheney donald rumsfeld and john mccain brought more than a century of experience to our foreign policy challenges
8561703 and what did that get us one international debacle after another
8561704 we deserve better than john mccains jokes about bombing iran or his denials that iraq has distracted us from afghanistan
8561705 when i returned from iraq i realized we didnt just need change over there we also needed to change how we treat our veterans here at home
8561706 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand with soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed weve had a president who spent billions on private contractors but not on body armor for all our troops
8561707 for the past eight years the man in the oval office has tipped his hat over his eyes kicked back his chair and snoozed at his desk while his vice president conspired with oil industry cronies
8561708 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8561709 yes we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time
8561710 safety is the number one concern for every single parent
8561711 we know there are significant incidents happening in our schools on a regular basis that are frightening for parents families and students themselves
8561712 parents shouldnt be too shocked by these numbers because theyre just a better reflection of the truth
8561713 theyre moving to address this theyre moving in the right direction
8561714 we have said if a crime is committed if violence occurs we want that directly reported to the philadelphia police department to school police
8561715 some of those schools are still doing a good job for some kids
8561716 persistently dangerous is a hard label for a school to shed and its a diagnosis that has to lead to a treatment
8561717 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases

8561772 with integration of exciting mediums like online and stronger more focused direct marketing approaches we will achieve our objective of increasing members
8561773 the above the line campaign is one element aimed at brand transformation which will connect with customers on an emotional level however our research also indicated that a brand re positioning would only address consumer perception the aa therefore also revamped the product intrinsic by developing the aa mobility programme
8561774 at the core of the aa mobility programme lies our roadside assistance and member benefits have been expanded to include a variety of exclusive discounts and benefits from a wide variety of motoring and lifestyle partners
8561775 the aa marketing team has worked towards achieving the core brand proposition of being in touch with mobility and working for the south african consumer with integrity
8561776 even though research clearly showed that the consumer sees the aa as a leader in roadside assistance and related services it also indicated that consumers want more from their aa membership we are confident that the marketing campaign and the aa mobility programme will firmly position the aa as providers of affordable travel solutions and leaders in motoring

8561825 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8561826 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose he must be our president
8561827 we need to elect barack obama because we need a president who understands that america cant compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas
8561828 we need a president who understands that we cant solve problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring the opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy
8561829 and when barack obama is in the white house he
8561830 the law recognises the difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the racist rantings of drug abusers

8561833 were mindful that hes not had a full pre season and as a result hes doing some extra fitness sessions with john harbin performance manager
8561834 all things being equal though he should be in contention to make the squad for our home fixture against southampton in mid september
8561835 hes really stepped up his fitness levels in recent weeks and the work hes doing with john is working wonders
8561836 hes already joining in with the first team warm up sessions and it shouldnt be too long before hes involved in the technical sessions too
8561837 realistically were looking at rowan returning to the squad in the coming weeks
8561838 its a different injury to the one that kept him sidelined last season but once again well have to treat it carefully
8561839 theres never a good time to get injured but with the international break imminent the two week period between fixtures will almost certainly mean he misses far fewer matches than he might have at another stage in the season

8561846 the main focus is that second largest party should be part of the government we will continue to back the pml n government in punjab province

8561851 in at amp t 3g umts power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue phone set requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
8561852 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput
8561853 because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data
8561854 in a mixed environment where users are running 2 0 2 0 1 and 2 0 2 the power control problems of 2 0 and 2 0 1 will affect the 2 0 2 users

8561876 and those who before them had homes and had adopted faith love those who emigrate to them and have no jealousy in their hearts for that which they have been given and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that and whosoever is saved from his own covetousness such are they who will be the successful

8561887 if people had negative experiences booking online there is a possibility they have gone back to the high street agents have become more customer centric following investment and training
8561888 there has definitely been a return to traditional high street retailers what we have seen in the last 12 to 18 months is the retail sector maturing in recognition of the fact there are so many other ways to book we have all got smarter in the way we serve customers

8561941 zich rekenschap geeft van cultuur en bijbehorende normen van onze samenleving
8561942 groot onbehagen in de nederlandse samenleving over concrete themas als de globalisering de nog steeds grote instroom van kansarme immigranten of het feit dat veel mensen in zorg onderwijs of politie door bureaucratie hun vak zijn kwijtgeraakt
8561943 dat komt omdat er te veel is beloofd en te weinig geleverd er is een pretentie geschapen alsof de staat verantwoordelijk is voor jouw en mijn geluk alsof er een samenleving mogelijk zou zijn met nul risico het leidt tot een duffer nederland en de terreur van de middelmaat daar moeten we vanaf

8561946 originally we had written a treatment that was visually more
8561947 while this got the commissioners attention once we started talking with the band everybody agreed that we needed to give the video more edge something a little darker and more sinister
8561948 so keeping the same premise we adjusted the styling and visual theme to a more two tone and literal jekyll hyde scenario where the band flip from one look to another from good guys to bad guys
8561949 were becoming big fans of keeping it simple maybe having learned a little of this the hard way i dont necessarily mean simple in execution but simple in keeping to the point
8561950 we shot in ardmore studios and had a finished edit of the green screen footage within a couple of days and we prepped some stills to show what the end result would look like
8561951 its easy to forget that for a lot of people involved that looking at the band in a big green soundstage doesnt make much sense without having an idea of where the look is going so this went a long way to helping everybody relax
8561952 once the edit was signed off we basically locked ourselves into a flame suite and mastered the pictures we shot in a digital format so nothing touched tape until the very end it was all done from shoot to delivery in about a week
8561953 het idee achter deze actie is dat deze vogel het nieuwe vitesse gaat belichamen
8561954 it was a blessing and a privilege to be your mother for 15 years

8561959 you didnt do anything wrong here have a wonderful life matt loved football just as much as you do
8561960 his restaurant dragon city has been closed since the attack
8561961 with the economy the way it is the restaurant remaining closed and all the expenses from the hospital we just thought someone should help this family
8561962 when we heard about this attack our hearts just went out to him and his family
8561963 five dollars is such a small amount of money for most of us but it could do so much good to help this neighbor of ours and member of the business community get back on his feet
8561964 you cant imagine something like that happening to somebody who wouldnt hurt anyone
8561965 he was trying to live the american dream raising a family working a lot of hours delivering the orders at the restaurant he owns whats more american than that this shouldnt happen to someone like that
8561966 ive got sandbags coming and were trying to head this off
8561967 my place is back there a block or so and its safe he said
8561968 i just came down because i was worried about these people i knew it rained hard last night but i didnt know it could get this bad
8561969 saying its the worst well thats sort of relative anyone who had to evacuate probably could say it was the worst at their place
8561970 when i got up this morning it was pretty high it was covering the fire hydrants
8561971 the fire department and police were here and i asked them if i could get a ride to work if the water hadnt gone down because i couldnt get out of my driveway
8561972 turns the spotlight on a page of soviet history that has been ignored until now
8561973 it is a superb story and tim tzouliadis tells it well largely thanks to a handful of extraordinary accounts written by the survivors
8561974 if a sparkling epistolary novel radiating wit and lightly worn erudition and written with great assurance and aplomb does the trick
8561975 the johnson who emerges is a rounded struggling character marked profoundly by his impoverished youth in lichfield his humiliatingly short stint as a student in oxford and his seemingly endless service as a grub street hack
8561976 adroit marshalling of evidence doesnt always make for vivid narrative
8561977 but the principal justification for a new biography is that johnsons life is so fascinating that like a favourite bedtime story posterity can listen to it over and over again
8561978 i dont know how much exactly but yes he has definitely lost weight
8561979 im not sure if it is for the role or whether he has just been on a diet

8561992 unsere ziele sind einfach werte erhalten und zwar durch fokus auf ein traditionsorientiertes kerngesch ft in dem aus unserer sicht viel potenzial schlummert von riskanten und unausgegorenen konzepten wie einer beteiligung der net mobile ag und den damit zu erwartenden riskanten operativen schritten halten wir herzlich wenig

8561994 need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8561995 absolutely there are always risks as the conflict is very close to ukraine and we have to show adequate vigilance in this regard and preclude any possible provocative actions as regards ukraine
8561996 i wont draw parallels here as these are absolutely different things ukraine is an independent free peace loving country which will never resort to any aggressive means crimea is an integral part of an independent ukraine
8561997 i repeat that it is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova

8562008 even if the military is firmly in charge of pakistans nuclear programme where is the civilian component in decision making
8562009 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear programme
8562010 there is no indication that the military does not exercise full control over pakistans nuclear assets

8562047 i was very pleased with the desire to play football and commitment to win
8562048 this gives the planning minister every opportunity to amalgamate mosman council and it will cease to exist if councillors treat attendance in such a cavalier matter
8562049 it makes a mockery of the people of mosman and councillors shouldnt just not attend meeting because theyre not seeking re election
8562050 in these instances we didnt get a true reflection of decision making and voting could have been different if all councillors were present
8562051 i saw a real challenge in bringing those lithe and youthful good looks of the younger man into the sculptural piece while also reflecting something of the larger man of middle years
8562052 i read where on one occasion armstrong sat down on the pitch and refused to move until the umpire recalled the players
8562053 in armstrongs view the innings had been declared at an end prematurely given his size it was an effective means of protest it was said that he wielded the bat like a teaspoon or a toothpick
8562054 spit east has been badly eroded by recent storms and we know there will be greater changes in the future

8562059 to lose a child in these horrific circumstances and then to be able to make these tough and courageous decisions is truly remarkable
8562060 across australia today there are 1866 australian families praying and hoping their loved one will receive a telephone call that will save their life with the news that an organ donor has become available
8562061 of great concern to us is the fact that despite having a working group for over 12 months the rta has at no point consulted with north sydney council or the residents and shopkeepers of neutral bay and cremorne
8562062 im appalled by the suggestion and im hoping the rta does not pick this up as thinking it is one supported by the council or the community
8562063 he is prepared very well for this spot but there will be some learning curves
8562064 the situation at our channel is about to blow up

8562097 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8562098 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8562099 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8562100 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8562101 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8562102 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8562103 are you finished because even if i am dead there will be people singing the same song stop abusing our children so even if you kill me there will be lots more people saying that
8562104 the man who used to come next door to do painting he did this
8562105 we couldnt just turn a blind eye to this and say it wouldnt happen to our children so what could we do
8562106 i used to say if it was my child who was raped i would have done the same as the policeman
8562107 it felt like i was in a tunnel but i had faith there would be light one day because the thing was by now in my genes i just wanted to do something i am illiterate with no money i am just an ordinary woman from the community but i wanted to do something to help
8562108 we had to teach people that if they slept with a child it was a crime not a cure but we are winning that battle because we have told so many people the truth we say guys it is in your blood how could it just vanish if you sleep with a child
8562109 sometimes when i talk about these things tears will just come
8562110 i remember one child was just 5 years old she was raped and abused so badly she couldnt use her back side anymore she had to have a bag for use for the rest of her life
8562111 we were given one room there was just one chair for the visitor so our clients used to wait outside even if it was raining
8562112 this all happens because of poverty these guys are roaming around doing nothing and because of poverty children are hungry these men offer them money for sweets and then they sleep with the child
8562113 my mother might not have known that this was an abuse but i knew that it was not sexual abuse but negligence yet still abuse i believe it has driven me to do this thing
8562114 this building grew up just from a bad thing that happened in my community
8562115 you cant do something if you dont have a passion inside you but you also need a sense of humour a love and a respect for parenting i never lose faith small children are taken drugged and everything people are spiteful and sometimes they kill each other all these things are happening but they are all in the bible
8562116 i am very proud of my community to do this thing because even if i died tomorrow i will sleep peacefully in my grave knowing that in khayelitsha we have got a place for abused children but every township in south africa needs this sort of thing
8562117 there were times like that two years ago i was called at 4 30am and a person said there is a problem at this particular house so i woke up called the police and we arrived at a scene where we saw a naked 16 year old girl who had been gang raped
8562118 i am sure the perpetrators left her because they thought she was dead
8562119 she was four months pregnant but she was destroyed inside because they had tried to kill her the child inside her died but the girl survived and she is a beautiful girl today she recovered mentally and she is a very nice young girl she couldnt go to school again because other children laughed at her after what had happened but what is good is she didnt die because when i stood in that room that night i was sure she was going to die
8562120 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed

8562129 i love going to the monda market which looks very colourful with fresh vegetables and hawkers screaming from top of their voices its a very noisy place but so much fun
8562130 while purchasing the entry tickets at charminar i spoke in hindi the counter person thought me to be an indian and gave me a local ticket instead of a foreign one it was one of my success stories and i shared it with my hindi teacher too

8562185 maam its hopeless they cant fix it somewhere the line is damaged and they cant find where
8562186 but the phone is working perfectly always has been its the same line thats coming into the house what do they mean they cant locate the damage the cable is not even underground its hanging in the air from the signal box right into our house
8562187 tsk tsk they wont do anything i think we should just cancel the connection
8562188 now what do i need to do as long as you start the conversation like that you know whats on the table and you know whats at risk you make your decision from there and thats the reason why im playing
8562189 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line ive put in a lot of work and i want to play
8562190 all of the doctors did say i needed surgery there just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looked pretty good and the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play im going to play
8562191 you couldnt be more thorough in terms of exhausting every situation in his mind what he needed to do what he needed to find out
8562192 he came back and expressed to me thats what he wanted to do its something hes obviously put an awful lot of time into were going to manage it and i hope he can manage it and be able to play
8562193 if i wasnt able to go out there and play at a high level and continue to do the things that i needed to do i wouldnt make this decision to play
8562194 for me its about going out there knowing what im capable of doing and going out and getting things done
8562195 were not going to put him out on the field if hes not going to be able to go out and perform and hes not going to want to be if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8562196 as i said repeatedly as we went through this process the days he practiced out here and was going 100 percent he looked like shawne merriman to me
8562197 i thought that id put myself in the best position to play
8562198 i felt good working out this offseason and it really didnt become a problem until i started to do more things on it
8562199 its the combination of the pcl and lcl that makes it tough
8562200 i dont think anybody thats been in the league for a certain amount of years plays the game at 100 percent
8562201 its about what youre able to deal with when theres adrenaline running you dont feel anything you might get a little restricted from the brace or something but for the most part and any player will tell you you feel that pain the next day when you wake up
8562202 do what makes you feel good as long as i get that advice and people are going to roll with me regardless of what my decision is thats what i appreciate
8562203 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is hes a warrior hes trained for this
8562204 the support i got and the love that i got from the guys in that locker room is all that i needed

8562215 recent events in the market have increased public concern and have damaged customers confidence that competition is working well and giving them a good deal customer confidence is vital for a well functioning market the detailed probe we are now launching will investigate whether the market is working well for all energy customers and not just particular groups such as those who are on the cheapest online deals
8562216 written and oral evidence has highlighted serious problems in the functioning of a number of aspects of the markets for gas and electricity
8562217 we are particularly concerned by the perception that ofgem has already predicted the outcome of its inquiry by stating at the outset that it has seen
8562218 we note that no witness has suggested that there is any evidence of active collusion in the wholesale or retail markets it is clear though that in a retail market dominated by six big players it is easy for those players to make informed judgements about the behaviour of their competitors this can distort competition without any active collusion occurring

8562224 when someone loves you the way they say your name is different you just know that your name is safe in their mouth
8562225 love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other
8562226 love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your french fries without making them give you any of theirs
8562227 love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him to make sure the taste is ok
8562228 love is when you kiss all the time then when you get tired of kissing you still want to be together and you talk more my mommy and daddy are like that they look gross when they kiss
8562229 love is whats in the room with you at christmas if you stop opening presents and listen
8562230 if you want to learn to love better you should start with a friend who you hate
8562231 love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt then he wears it everyday
8562232 love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well
8562233 during my piano recital i was on a stage and i was scared i looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling he was the only one doing that i wasnt scared anymore
8562234 my mommy loves me more than anybody you dont see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night
8562235 love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken

8562263 immigration is a very hot topic every time i go to wal mart i have constituents approach
8562264 now i have something to tell them thank you rep looper i can tell them to call you
8562265 we can close this deficiency by passing co hb 1325 the alien importation act of 2008 as with foreign oil lets increase our dependency on foreign labor
8562266 do you recall the defend colorado now immigration petition in 2006
8562267 all those mean colorado citizens wanted to take welfare state benefits away from our foreign cousins visiting us here from our extended world family
8562268 now a second branch of state government our responsive legislature is also heeding the public will
8562269 you say americans dont want this seasonal work at any wage
8562270 no wonder since the cato institute estimated about eight years ago that the cash value of colorados total welfare benefits was the equivalent of 10 05 per hour eight years later its probably closer to 14 per hour pretty good income for doing nothing
8562271 why work when government will pay you not to work
8562272 here we can show our international compassion and at the same time prop up the welfare state entitlements that created the wage rate distortion such a deal
8562273 obviously we cant use prison labor to pick crops as other states do
8562274 the convicts might object or get calluses on their hands or they might eat too much of the crops they are picking and contribute to our obesity crisis we wouldnt want that on our conscience
8562275 we cant let free market labor pricing work that is too radical a concept
8562276 once we implement this brilliant program for agriculture can manufacturing construction and other labor sectors be far behind
8562277 maybe we could also import our politicians we couldnt do worse
8562278 look how successful this program has been in germany and other parts of europe which now are overflowing with turkish greek and other immigrants angrily creating their own subcultures
8562279 we have plenty of examples of the results of our immigration tolerance both legal and illegal
8562280 nice foreign national who came to colorado illegally to serve you
8562281 hb 1325 is an ingenious solution to the illegal alien problem
8562282 it makes them legal because government gives them a piece of paper
8562283 of course over the next five years these 15 000 aliens will all go home when requested for sure we promise
8562284 how do we know because hb 1325 plans it that way and all laws work as intended right also we have their promises on paper no one will skip out and disappear in the vast underground of our growing and anonymous subculture
8562285 just because we already have more than 10 20 million examples to the contrary doesnt mean our failed immigration policy wont work this time besides theres always the next amnesty
8562286 democrats should support this bill even though it is a precedent to further undermine organized labor after all when the next amnesty comes these people are expected to register and vote democrat
8562287 republicans should support this bill to maintain their image of exploiting the little guy on behalf of big business another win win win for our noble and responsive political system
8562288 from the halls of congress we learn that the social service costs for just the illegal aliens is upwards of 436 billion annually
8562289 these figures are relevant to this bill because we will be importing our guests from the segment of third world foreign societies that provides the same people who now invade illegally we just bring them here first we thwart their illegality by legalizing it ta da
8562290 the america i knew growing up did not have these problems
8562291 we naively believed america had borders for a reason and that we were not the dumping ground for other countries workers trading their failed political economic and social systems for our own
8562292 yes colleagues we can pass this bill as a responsive tribute to the more than 12 to 20 million enterprising aliens now roaming around america
8562293 a person with entrepreneurial spirit is found in three bodies the classic entrepreneur corporate corporate and the social entrepreneur
8562294 can start anytime using any of the three passion market opportunity or capability
8562295 the classic entrepreneur has to be successful in making his firm full of corporate entrepreneurs he can do good while doing well

8562316 the trends highlighted by this survey mirror what were seeing across the travel and tourism industry
8562317 more time was needed to ensure that a wide variety of stakeholders had been consulted and that public participation may have been insufficient to see the bill through
8562318 the retraction of the expropriation bill is proof of the power civil society can exert when its organisations co operate with each other
8562319 the expropriation bills stipulation that the expropriation amount may be less than the market value of the property and that market value will not be the determining factor would have deterred local as well as international investors had it been implemented
8562320 i heard a few weeks ago that the parliamentary legal advisers concurred with sapoas position which was that certain provisions of the amendment bill were unconstitutional and there were other aspects such as the definition of property that needed clarification
8562321 good news and that the government had listened to the petition from the business community

8562326 the mmd has to continue with mr banda because we dont have healing time before the by election is held
8562327 it is my strong appeal to all those who will seat in the nec to adopt the sitting acting republican president
8562328 the vice president who is now acting president has a proven record as far as focus and addressing urgent developmental issues is concerned mr banda has the ability needed to deliver the mmd promise to the nation because he is able to act responsibly
8562329 i have served in the mmd government since 1991 in various capacities from which i have accumulated the necessary experience to serve our party in the position of president
8562330 building on the legacy of president mwanawasa the kopulande administration will build a pro integrity government with in built mechanisms to prevent corruption
8562331 i believe that mmd is a dynamic party that should continue calling upon committed and intelligent leadership that will provide hope to zambias youth and future generations
8562332 i have worked with these agencies and i am comfortable dealing with them as leader of the mmd i will continue to advance zambias relationship with these agencies
8562333 we have attended to more than 20 people so far but none of their conditions can be described as critical

8562337 we have all been touched by the presidents death people have really mourned our president he was a good man we are very much affected all of us its like its just a dream i feel like i will wake up and find it was a dream maybe when i see his body tomorrow wednesday august 27 2008 during body viewing i will be able to accept that he has actually died
8562338 this government is very considerate of the poor we would have spent a lot of money on travelling to lusaka certainly we would have travelled to pay our last respects we are very grateful that they have brought our president to us
8562339 i have travelled all the way from senanga just to come and view the body of our father even if it was in lusaka i would have gone because president mwanawasa was a man of the people i didnt agree with him at first on a number of things but i later appreciated his leadership i personally dont see anything political about this programme of the body being flown to provincial headquarters
8562340 i can give you for k40 000 otherwise i was selling them for k60 000 there is no business i have been here for three days now people are not buying previously i would sell over 50 kg every day
8562341 we have seen a lot of good things here under president mwanawasa than any other president we needed president mwanawasa even after david lewanika general hospital was gutted his government immediately repaired it and we understand they even extended it
8562342 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews

8562348 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8562349 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8562350 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

8562363 its clearly important to track obesity and to offer help to those who are overweight but it is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that shetland is an obesity hotspot
8562364 it is slightly misleading and too simplistic to say that shetland has the highest level of obesity in the country in fact i can say with confidence we are actually well below the national average for obesity
8562365 however we hope to publish a healthy weight strategy shortly which will include measures like improving public transport because people on shetland are more likely to take the car because the distances are too far to walk and the inclement weather

8562393 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse
8562394 i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8562395 without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8562396 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8562397 im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living
8562398 i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan

8562400 many folks around the country have never voted for an african american not for president
8562401 but we are confident barack obama will be elected when working class voters know who he is and what he stands for
8562402 we need to accept the fact that there are going to be some angry white guys who wont vote for barack obama because hes a black man
8562403 the fundamental challenge for us is not the whole issue of what color his skin is its that our economy has gone into the toilet
8562404 the reality is we have the first african american candidate running for president and you cant minimize that dynamic
8562405 we have to keep it simple we have to tell a worker the difference between barack and mccain is that mccain is trying to do away with employer provided health care
8562406 mccain has not distanced himself from bushs economic policies at all
8562407 i dont think white working class voters have been made aware of that yet and as economics comes to the fore you can expect that obama will capture a lot of the undecideds

8562430 a club in europe wanted ajibade and they offered 20 000 twenty thousand dollars and i felt that was an insult to enyimba
8562431 last season ajibade got five million naira about 42 000 as sign on fees and when you consider that in the five seasons he has spent with us he as taken close to twenty million naira about 170 000 from in sign on fees and salaries then you will agree with me that enyimba were insulted with that offer
8562432 i think it is all wrong and i hope our players do not continue to belittle themselves with this craze for europe
8562433 a manchester united player does not just leave camp two weeks to a uefa champions league match against ac milan to go on trials at barcelona so why should our case be different
8562434 we always release our players but we will not derail our ambitions because we want to let our players off to europe
8562435 eventually we want the best for our players and if our players do as well as they are doing now we will eventually not be able to hold on to them
8562436 what i always tell them to do is be careful and not be in too much of a hurry to leave for europe but allow europe to look for them

8562462 hello brian i dont know about you but i am always cheered by the sight of rows of axles on the move true how true martin trouble is apart from the combitrailers used by container haulers and the occasional heavy indivisible load such sights are not enjoyed that often in britain
8562463 its different in michigan state of course where in order to haul the maximum gross of 74 tonnes its necessary to have 11 axles under the combination so for the sake of variety and in order to add a little lustre to an otherwise rather ordinary day i am attaching a few images of some of michigans finest hauling timber and steel coils for blb of course
8562464 the covered wagon trailers utilised by the steel haulers are configured with different axle spacings and groupings in order to accommodate coils of different sizes and weights and although the owner operator preference is for kenworth and peterbilt i managed to find a ford western star and autocar at64f too hope the pics are suitable martin

8562469 we achieved a phenomenal weekend with the help of mopar nuformz racing and bfgoodrich
8562470 we took the points lead in the championship battle and second place in the event and thats not bad at all considering how difficult it was to go 60 to 70 mph sideways in the rain it was definitely the trickiest event for me but the result was outstanding now we just have to keep the momentum and grab the championship
8562471 we took second in my old charger but most importantly i was mobbed by fans for the entire event they loved the hemi powered charger this was the first time many of them had ever seen drifting and we had great media coverage including espn so i think it was great exposure for my sponsors mopar and bfgoodrich and also for drifting i think we helped grow the sport in a new market

8562481 to moses face to face as a man speaks to his friend
8562482 greater love has no one than this than to lay down ones life for his friends you are my friends if you do whatever i command you no longer do i call you servants for a servant does not know what his master is doing but i have called you friends for all things that i heard from my father i have made known to you
8562483 my loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague and my relatives stand afar off
8562484 even my own familiar friend in whom i trusted who ate my bread has lifted up his heel against me
8562485 she weeps bitterly in the night her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she has none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they have become her enemies
8562486 do not trust in a friend do not put your confidence in a companion guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom
8562487 then some of the officials of asia who were his friends sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theatre
8562488 so he commanded the centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him
8562489 and the next day we landed at sidon and julius treated paul kindly and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care
8562490 his mouth is most sweet yes he is altogether lovely this is my beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem
8562491 who does not backbite with his tongue nor does evil to his neighbor nor does he take up a reproach against his friend
8562492 a friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity
8562493 a man who has friends must himself be friendly but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother
8562494 faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
8562495 ointment and perfume delight the heart and the sweetness of a mans friend gives delight by hearty counsel
8562496 do not forsake your own friend or your fathers friend nor go to your brothers house in the day of your calamity better is a neighbor nearby than a brother far away

8562506 total dana yang disiapkan sekitar us 1 95 miliar untuk capex dan buyback obligasi

8562511 dari ing dan dbs kami memperoleh pinjaman sebesar us 450 juta jadi total dana yang kami punya sebesar us 1 45 miliar
8562512 sehingga jika digabungkan dengan ebitda total dana yang kami punya hampir us 1 95 miliar
8562513 jadi dari capex us 1 4 miliar yang untuk memperkuat jaringan sebesar us 1 2 miliar sedangkan yang us 200 juta itu untuk pengembangan satelit dananya sudah ada dari pinjaman diluar yang digalang ing dan dbs jadi semua kebutuhan dana tidak ada masalah

8562515 be given the appropriate consideration by the commission and be duly referenced in its policy documents in particular wherever the commissions policy choices depart from our studies main recommendations
8562516 seems to reveal an intention to mislead the council and the parliament as well as the citizens of the european union in doing so the commission reinforces the suspicion already widely held by the public at large that its policies are less the product of a rational decision making process than of lobbying by stakeholders
8562517 the food and drink industry is a vital part of the economy and life of the highlands and islands
8562518 the area is a major player in this industry and is home to a very significant proportion of scotlands iconic and quality produce
8562519 it is untenable that the next stages of the national food and drink policy can be properly formulated without the experience and expertise from this vital part of the countrys industry
8562520 it is particularly offensive that the scottish government does not seem to have recognised that the leaders of the highlands and islands food industry have the experience and expertise which would benefit of the whole of scotland
8562521 i would urge the minister to rectify this snub to the highland industry and select someone from the many appropriate experts the area has to offer

8562543 experience of migrating to britain and facing marginalisation and racism
8562544 t he failure of those with degrees to achieve anything but low grade jobs a serious criminal past travel abroad for up to six months at a time and contact with extremist networks overseas and religious naivety
8562545 this feeling is heightened by mainstream uk media coverage that perpetuates negative stereotypes of muslims by islamic and non islamic media that reports atrocities against muslims worldwide and by the extremist groups themselves who spread the message that muslims are being persecuted to the point that the only course of action is to fight back with violence
8562546 t he relationship between criminality and radicalisation is complex with some criminals attracted by the violent aspects of terrorism while others with a criminal past felt genuine regret for their activities some appeared to have turned to violent extremist groups in the misguided belief that participation in jihad might help atone for previous wrongdoing
8562547 we have noticed that terrorist groups are remarkably tolerant of individuals with serious criminal histories this is the case even when those individuals continue to be involved in very serious non terrorist crimes including drug trafficking assault and even rape
8562548 no single measure will reduce radicalisation it says but a package targeted at vulnerable groups could include providing fulfilling jobs for young people better integration of immigrants effective reintegration of ex prisoners and the provision of alternatives to the extremist pathway out of ordinary criminality
8562549 law enforcement to disrupt existing networks remains vitally important but the impact of those who unwittingly exacerbate the perception of threat and marginalisation must not be neglected sections of the media our own and allies governments can sometimes make statements that are unwittingly or deliberately provocative non muslim groups e g right wing extremists can also stoke false fears and resentments which can heighten the perception of threat in muslim communities
8562550 how stupid does australia look when we are flying people in from overseas to do these jobs

8562576 well lose him now for the next two games so that is a little disappointing but you have to live with that when you have internationals
8562577 its a great problem to have and thats probably why we havent used neale fenn as much in the last few weeks as hes been carrying a knock
8562578 we knew kalonas would be going so i didnt want to aggravate that and have fenn missing for the next few games
8562579 kalonas english is okay its not brilliant you have to be slow with him but hes starting to call people now and getting used to names
8562580 the first couple of weeks we left him alone put him on the bench and gave him time to introduce himself in a couple of games but now he wants to play
8562581 i have seen some dirty tactics from the labor party yes i have but nothing like this
8562582 in politics you put out your positive agenda and there is always a negative approach to the opposition
8562583 the state secretary has assured me it contains only information that is factual and already on the public record
8562584 there are much more important things to discuss like labors policies i have accordingly directed that the truth about troy website be removed

8562587 its clearly a liberal party push or stunt in a state election context to try and make things difficult for the state government of the day and i think people will see it that way
8562588 hes spoony in charge of giving us some cool chilling inspirational stuff
8562589 you have to get the balance right between being intense and being relaxed that is key i want to prepare whoever needs to be prepared for friday morning
8562590 i think well pay more attention to detail than them the americans have the attitude that they are all great players and they plonk them in and see what happens
8562591 of course they can all play well but there is a mystery about the ryder cup an x factor
8562592 we are looking for a run in this competition and that will obviously mean a lot more games this season thats why were trying to build a squad that would be able to cope with that
8562593 if you look at a side in many ways similar to ourselves last season everton i dont think they would have been able to cope with the size of the squad that we had last year
8562594 certainly if wed been in evertons position with a run in europe it would have been an impossibility to have done that
8562595 now were trying to get a bit stronger both numerically but more importantly in terms of a bit of quality so that from a thursday to a sunday we are able to go into major games looking quite strong
8562596 that is something you could do with the best will in the world we could feel quite strong next monday and feel weve done our utmost and still end up in the scenario that west ham had last year the number of injuries they sustained would have been hard for anybody to have kept going
8562597 that can happen to the best of teams but you want to try and make as much provision as you can and thats what the last few days of the window are about in terms of looking to try and strengthen
8562598 hes won twice this year his form has been very good in recent weeks and hes played on five ryder cups and had four winning teams and hes a natural partner to lee westwood
8562599 if you had everybody picking i think clarke would be a lock but obviously nick could see different reasons but if i was picking id be picking darren
8562600 darren carries stature into the ryder cup which is very important when you tee it up on the first tee you want your opposition standing there and feeling that theyre coming up against somebody who has a bit of stature darren has that and monty has that too
8562601 the guy has played eight ryder cups has never lost a singles match and hes due a consideration

8562605 a tough reliable and totally genuine horse like royal shakespeare should be celebrated not castigated
8562606 i would have thought he epitomised what the order of merit should be about so therefore i was deeply disappointed by the unnecessary reaction from this committee
8562607 its particularly galling as his injury he is currently recovering from a double fracture to a bone at the back of his knee at kempton was caused because he was trying too hard
8562608 why not give the cash and the trophy to paul nicholls yard at the start of the season that should help to attract a new sponsor
8562609 it would save all the nasty competitive stuff after all the very last thing we need is another super tough horse from a small yard winning again do we
8562610 we are helping michael as he deals with some personal issues and he has the full support of everyone at the club
8562611 we would ask that his privacy and that of his family is respected at this time and the club will not be commenting further on this matter

8562615 in view of the demands made and the time frame required for negotiations with wdlac the company feels it has little choice but to seek arbitration under the provisions of the native title act to move forward
8562616 we are very disappointed to have to suspend our production on the tiwi islands but unless we can achieve significant improvements in our operating margins the financial risk of continuing operations is too high
8562617 despite the short term economic conditions matilda remains confident in the longer term future of the mineral sands industry and will continue its exploration efforts on the highly prospective cape york tenements this season matilda is currently actively pursuing other minerals sands opportunities both nationally and internationally
8562618 matilda has been developing a coal strategy for some time and these epcs are an integral part of this strategy we have to date been exclusively a minerals sands company focussing on zircon and rutile and the proposed diversification into coal should if successful offer excellent growth prospects for the company

8562626 losing bretts a massive loss for the team and its up to the guys who come in and take the reins including myself to put their hands up
8562627 we want to win every series we play in it doesnt matter who were playing we want to win and win convincingly
8562628 theyve done it upset australia before but weve got to go out and perform if they pressure us then weve got to match them
8562629 we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is
8562630 weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage

8562648 a new jersey company plans to announce on tuesday that it is working on a solution to this perennial problem with wind power using wind turbines to produce compressed air that can be stored underground or in tanks and released later to power generators during peak hours the new company energy storage and power will promote the use of compressed air storage technology to utilities and other power producers more favorable locations include upstate new york where there are depleted salt mines as well as wind farms old coal mines and tapped out natural gas fields can also be converted into underground reservoirs roy daniel the chief executive of energy storage and power said that an underground reservoir the size of giants stadium could hold enough compressed air to power three 300 megawatt plants one megawatt hour can power a large hospital for an hour the reservoirs which are typically more than 1 500 feet below ground could take eight hours to fill at night the compressed air would be released to run generators for eight hours during the day
8562649 michael nakhamkin an inventor whose system is used at the only north american power plant that stores energy underground in the form of pressurized air when electricity demand rises the trapped air is released to turn a power turbine the technology which works like a battery might widen use of renewable energy plants because they could bank surplus power made when sunlight or wind is exceptionally strong the venture energy storage amp power llc will improve compressed air technology to make low polluting generation more efficient pseg will market and license the technology using patents held by nakhamkin who is chief technical officer of the new venture and works in basking ridge new jersey the systems can be used to generate from 15 to 450 megawatts of power nakhamkin said in an interview yesterday one megawatt is enough to power about 900 average u s homes

8562651 a former chrysler canada worker has designed and patented what he says is the
8562652 a centre spool in the cylinder head is wrapped with copper coils when a driver turns the key the battery sends voltage to the coil which then becomes an electromagnet instead of to the spark plugs and the magnet drives the pistons
8562653 and mine just uses a repelling motion to drive the pistons rather than a combination of repelling and attraction
8562654 electromagnets are strong enough to pull trains so theres no issue with them being strong enough to drive the pistons
8562655 all the blocks used in this engine will be aluminum so theyre not magnetic and the cylinder head and the electromagnets will have a protective cover so they dont affect the vehicles electronic systems
8562656 and because the system pulses just like a sparkplug theres no constant drain on the battery
8562657 alternative fuel is all the rage at the democratic national convention where a goody bag offered to reporters included a wind turbine lapel pin but the real future of energy may not play out in denver this week the real future of energy may be playing out in colorado springs and that future may be coal bob neumanns invention five years in the making uses a secret chemical formula to clean up sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and particulates other inventions to clean up coal emissions have been too bulky and expensive to catch on neumanns invention is less than a tenth the size of competing equipment and it costs two thirds less city officials say early results have exceeded all expectations and the device has outperformed anything else on the market congratulations to neumann and to the colorado springs utilities for working together in an invention that could change the world it costs the city virtually nothing to lend its plant to the project and the utility was so confident that it invested 1 million in the project an investment that will almost certainly pay off many times over in coming years

8562678 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon
8562679 what happens then is light from the sun shines on the body of the asteroid so more of it is reflected and it actually acts to move it away from the sun and the earth
8562680 the doctrine of signatures is an ancient european philosophy that held that plants bearing parts that resembled human body parts animals or other objects had useful relevancy to those parts animals or objects and its been said that god first separated the salt water from the fresh made dry land planted a garden made animals and fish all before making a human he made and provided what wed need before we were born a few examples a sliced carrot looks like the human eye the pupil iris and radiating lines look just like the human eye and science shows that carrots greatly enhance blood flow to and function of the eyes a walnut looks like a little brain a left and right hemisphere upper cerebrums and lower cerebellums even the wrinkles or folds are on the nut just like the neo cortex we now know that walnuts help develop over 3 dozen neuron transmitters for brain function celery bok choy rhubarb and more look just like bones these foods specifically target bone strength eat well kidney beans actually heal and help maintain kidney function and yes they look exactly like the human kidneys a tomato has four chambers and is red the heart is red and has four chambers all of the research shows tomatoes are indeed pure heart and blood food sweet potatoes look like the pancreas and actually balance the glycemic index of diabetics grapefruits oranges and other citrus fruits look just like the mammary glands of the female and actually assist the health of the breasts and the movement of lymph in and out of the breasts

8562684 years ago neurologists noticed a strange pattern of people suffering strokes shortly after seeing chiropractors specifically for neck adjustments their hypothesis was that a chiropractic technique called cervical spinal manipulation involving a forceful twisting of the neck could damage two major arteries that lead through the neck to the back of the brain strokes in people under age 45 are relatively rare but these cervical arterial dissections are a leading cause of them studies that followed suggested a link but other studies have cast doubt one published this year examined 818 cases of stroke linked to arterial dissections at the back of the neck before their strokes younger patients who saw chiropractors were more likely to have complained beforehand of head and neck pain symptoms often preceding a stroke suggesting they had undiagnosed dissections and had sought out chiropractors for relief not realizing a stroke was imminent

8562686 for anyone who has ridden in a hybrid theres something a little weird about the first time you sit idling at a stop light the sound of silence when the engine turns itself off in lieu of the electric motors can be disconcerting there is a hidden danger to the handicapped however specifically the blind without the sound of an engine the blind apparently step out into traffic believing the coast to be clear whereupon they endure a green mauling the problem has occurred enough that california americas leading state of car oppression is introducing a bill mandating cars create a minimum level of noise so the visually impaired will know they are present

8562692 1 bbe symposium bio net 08 akzeptanz durch eine nachhaltige bioenergienutzung sichern
8562693 in den vergangenen jahren haben wachsende marktanteile die biomasse aus ihrer nische herausgef hrt und sie f r andere branchen offensichtlich zu einem ernst zu nehmenden konkurrenten gemacht zahlreiche kritiker arbeiten beharrlich daran die rolle der bioenergie in der ffentlichen wahrnehmung zu wandeln der hoffnungstr ger der erneuerbaren energien soll zum buhmann gemacht werden in der ffentlichen diskussion wird immer wieder der boden der tatsachen verlassen und es werden unzutreffende schuldzuweisungen gemacht deshalb haben wir uns entschlossen mit diesem symposium fakten hintergrundinformationen und wirkungszusammenh nge ber den bioenergiemarkt zu vermitteln und zu diskutieren
8562694 die teils sehr populistisch gef hrte debatte zeigt deutlich wir m ssen besser und gezielter informieren und gegebenenfalls in der einen oder anderen frage umsteuern
8562695 um die potenziale voll auszusch pfen brauchen wir die landwirte als rohstoffproduzenten sowie in den regionen verankerte wertsch pfungsketten dabei gilt es m glichen fehlentwicklungen beizeiten gegenzusteuern und weiterhin die umweltgerechte bereitstellung von biomasseroh und reststoffen durch die landwirtschaft sicherzustellen
8562696 ich hoffe dass es uns gelingt verloren gegangenes vertrauen bei verbrauchern landwirten und unternehmern wieder zu gewinnen weil es f r den ausbau s mtlicher erneuerbarer energien voraussetzung ist
8562697 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment
8562698 we need 100bn plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment we must not lose sight of that
8562699 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam memerintahkan kami dengan shadaqah fithri sebelum diturunkannya kewajiban zakat dan tatkala diturunkannya kewajiban zakat beliau tidak memerintahkan kami dan tidak pula melarang kami tetapi kami mengerjakan mengeluarkan zakat fithri
8562700 bahwa pada sanadnya ada rawi yang tidak dikenal196 akan tetapi hadits tersebut mempunyai penguat dan dikeluarkan oleh an nasai 5 49 dan ibnu majah 1 585 dan ahmad 6 6 ibnu khuzaimah 4 81 dan al hakim 1 410 dan al baihaqi 4 159 dari beberapa jalan dan sanadnya shahih dan kalaupun dianggap shahih tidak ada dalil yang menunjukkan atas naskh diahapusnya hadits qais yang menunjukkan wajibnya zakat fithri mungkin rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mencukupkan dengan perintah yang pertama karena turunnya suatu kewajiban tidaklah menggugurkan kewajiban yang lain
8562701 ini tidak menunjukkan hilangnya kewajiban zakat fithri tetapi hanya menunjukkan tambahan dalam jenis ibadah tidak mengharuskan dimansukhknya hukum sebelumnya kedudukan zakat harta sebagaiman kedudukan zakat fithri yaitu berkaitan dengan riqab orang per orang
8562702 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mewajibkan zakat fithri sebanyak satu gantang kurma atau satu gantang gandum atas hamba dan orang yang merdeka kecil dan besar dari kalangan kaum muslimin
8562703 tidak wajib atas orang yang puasa karena hadits ibnu abbas radhiallahu anhuma
8562704 zakat fithri wajib atas orang yang puasa yang kaya atau orang fakir yang mendapatkan makanan dari dia jika illat diwajibkannya karena pensucian maka seluruh orang yang puasa butuh akan hal itu jika berserikat dalam illat berserikat pula dalam hukum
8562705 pensucian disebutkan untuk menghukumi yang dominan zakat fithri diwajibkan pula atas orang yang tidak berpuasa seperti diketahui keshahihannya atau orang yang masuk islam sesaat sebelum terbenamnya matahari
8562706 kami mengeluarkan zakat pada zaman rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam satu gantang makanan satu gantang gandum satu gantang korma satu gantang susu kering satu gantang anggur kering
8562707 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mewajibkan atu gantang gandum satu gantang korma dan satu gantang salt
8562708 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam menyuruh kami untuk mengeluarkan zakat ramadhan satu gantang makanan dari anak kecil besar budak dan orang yang merdeka
8562709 barangsiapa yang mengeluarkan berupa tepung akan diterima barangsiapa yang mengeluarkan berupa adonan diterima
8562710 zakat fithri satu gantang makanan barangsiapa yang membawa gandum diterima yang membawa korma diterima yang membawa salt gandum yang tidak berkulit diterima yang membawa anggur kering diterima aku mengira beliau berkata
8562711 dulu makanan kami adalah gandum anggur kering susu yang dikeringkan dan korma
8562712 tunaikanlah satu gantang gandum atau korma untuk dua orang satu gantang dari gandum atas orang merdeka hamba anak kecil atau besar
8562713 timbangan yang teranggap adalah timbangannya ahlu mekah dan kiloan yang teranggap adalah kiloan nya orang madinah
8562714 kami diperintah oleh rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam mengeluarkan shadaqah fithri atas anak kecil dan orang tua orang merdeka dan hamba dari orang orang yang membekalinya
8562715 rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam zakat fithri sebagai pembersih diri bagi yang berpuasa dari perbuatan sia sia dan perbuatan kotor dan sebagai makanan bagi orang orang miskin
8562716 barangsiapa yang menunaikan zakatnya sebelum shalat maka dia adalah zakat yang diterima dan barangsiapa yang menunaikannya setelah shalat maka dia adalah merupakan shadaqah dari beberapa shadaqah yang ada

8562719 the flurry of activity of the nato naval forces which continue building up their grouping in the black sea arouses suspicion
8562720 moreover we have learned that eight more nato warships are to arrive shortly
8562721 what is the purpose of all this references are being made to scheduled exercises and indeed one can see some legitimacy in this
8562722 but these eight warships expected to arrive in the black sea will carry cargoes of a different kind not humanitarian aid
8562723 its very hard to believe that all other arrivals of nato warships at georgian ports were for humanitarian aid purposes only as declared
8562724 triodos gaat niet voor maximale winst maar voor maximale duurzaamheid de bank heeft er altijd voor gekozen dicht bij de re le economie te blijven
8562725 zeker het gaat ten koste van ons marktaandeel maar we zijn er blij mee het gaat ons om meer aandacht voor duurzaamheid
8562726 steeds meer anders dan bedrijven of zelfs de overheid zijn burgers van nature geneigd in generaties te denken ze hebben ouders krijgen zelf kinderen de sterkste groei bij ons zit in de kinderspaarrekeningen
8562727 het is nog niet intrinsiek de grote multinationals zijn volgend wat dat betreft de koplopers in het bedrijfsleven op duurzaamheid zitten in het midden en kleinbedrijf de manier waarop groenrechts met duurzaamheid omgaat is alleen het gevoel verkopen de groenlinkse stroming maakt duurzaamheid te veel afhankelijk van overheidsstimulering wij bepleiten een derde weg met een goede balans tussen korte en langetermijnbelangen
8562728 dat ligt genuanceerd nu hebben de groene beleggingsfondsen de stimulans nog nodig maar dat komt omdat het systeem eigenlijk verkeerd is als je in plaats van duurzaamheid te subsidi ren een belasting heft op bedrijven die waarde onttrekken aan de maatschappij dan is overheidssteun niet nodig de vervuiler moet betalen ook de belegger die in vervuilende producten belegt maar dat is nu nog niet aan de orde
8562729 ja maar nauwelijks we zitten bewust niet in heel speculatieve markten beweeglijke markten zijn per definitie niet duurzaam andere partijen springen van markt naar markt op zoek naar de hoogste winstmarges maar wij beleggen bijvoorbeeld niet in mijnbouw het gedrag van andere banken wordt aangewakkerd door de bonussencultuur dat is een systeem waar we vanaf moeten we moeten op meerdere terreinen investeren in een lange termijn duurzame visie
8562730 je zou kunnen beginnen met het belonen van een duurzame relatie tussen aandeelhouders en een bedrijf het stemrecht op de aandeelhoudersvergadering moet je koppelen aan de duur van het aandeelhouderschap een duurzame relatie werkt al wel bij werknemers en klanten dus waarom niet bij de aandeelhouder
8562731 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab
8562732 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show green taxes should be kept as they are or cut

8562738 we try are level best not to get into any shit but ultimately land up in one
8562739 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2 for example while fuel duty recognises the environmental costs of driving it also pays for important public services including new roads and public transport and efforts to tackle child poverty
8562740 people pay for electricity motor fuels and other goods subject to green taxes with income that has already been taxed companies that pay green taxes also pay corporation tax and most green taxes are accompanied by vat
8562741 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives the government has fuelled public scepticism by failing to use tax breaks and public spending to make it cheaper and easier to go green if green taxes are to work the government must also invest in greener alternatives such as public transport
8562742 im concerned that such high cash balances are being retained by many schools
8562743 im sure that the money could be put to much better use on the day to day educational needs of pupils rather than sitting in bank accounts doing nothing
8562744 this is something we are very concerned about because the money is there for the childrens education and should not be kept back
8562745 we can claim back some of these sums and we clawed back two per cent last year we are looking to do more than that this year to stop too much being carried forward
8562746 we will warn the schools in advance and if it continues we will reclaim the money
8562747 hard pressed taxpayers funding local schools want to see their money spent providing children with a quality education not piling up in school bank accounts
8562748 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8562749 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8562750 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8562751 excessive green taxes hit poorer people hardest hurt the competitiveness of british firms cause britain to export emissions and fall disproportionately on residents of rural and suburban areas
8562752 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power
8562753 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives

8562770 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that
8562771 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8562772 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8562773 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8562774 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8562775 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8562776 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8562777 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from

8562829 wir mussten wirklich hart arbeiten damit das auto gut ber die wellen kam und nicht aufschlug
8562830 aber im qualifying hat sich ein ferrari auf seiner schnellen runde gedreht und die session wurde dann abgebrochen als einer unserer teamkollegen in eine mauer gefahren war
8562831 ich habe meinem team ber funk gesagt dass ich einfach geduldig bin und darauf warte dass er einen fehler macht
8562832 hier zu berholen ist genauso schwierig wie in monaco aber ich hatte einen guten start und verbesserte mich auf rang f nf hinter einem der ferrari
8562833 es gab keine chance an ihm vorbeizukommen deshalb habe ich meinem team ber funk gesagt dass ich einfach geduldig bin und darauf warte dass er einen fehler macht gl cklicherweise hat er einen gemacht und ich kam vorbei dann wurde ein anderer ferrari noch gerammt das hat uns vorgebracht auf rang drei
8562834 das war gut denn von dort aus ist einiges m glich
8562835 in der ersten kurve konnte ich mich auf rang zwei verbessern und ging dann neben toni vilander in die schikane rob bell dr ngte mich ab deshalb musste ich mir einen anderen weg durch die schikane suchen um nicht gerammt zu werden bell hat dann vilander gerammt und ich bernahm die f hrung
8562836 als ich auf der geraden war habe ich daran gedacht wie die offiziellen in diesem jahr sind ich bin in der schikane zwar au enrum gefahren um nicht gerammt zu werden aber ich wollte nicht riskieren eine strafe zu bekommen deshalb bin ich vom gas gegangen und habe vilander wieder die f hrung berlassen meinen vorsprung auf bell konnte ich aber vergr ern
8562837 vilander war ein oder zwei zehntel schneller und gegen ihn konnte ich wirklich nichts ausrichten den zweiten platz haben wir dann wegen eines langsamen boxenstopps an bell verloren aber es war sch n mal wieder vorne mitzuk mpfen

8562858 an increasing willingness to allow the actions of individuals to disadvantage and even endanger others if those actions derive from religious faith
8562859 studies have shown that 14 of u s doctors when confronted by possibly objectionable but legal medical treatments not only would refuse to deliver such care but also would refuse to inform their patients about it or refer them to physicians who would deliver the care
8562860 about 40 million people who would receive substandard care from these physicians who believe that their religious convictions are more important than the well being of their patients
8562861 our deference to religion in contemporary american society has allowed us to subordinate all other values it has allowed us to routinely accept religiously motivated behaviors that we otherwise would have no reluctance to sanction and that indeed would be impermissible with any other justification
8562862 in the united states we all are free to practice our religion as we see fit as long as we do not interfere with the well being of others by imposing our religious views on them if physicians or other healthcare providers who have religious objections to legal medical treatments will not at a minimum inform their patients about those treatments and refer them to others who will deliver them they should act in a way that is consistent with their convictions and the well being of their patients and find other professions

8562898 yes the cars are very expensive they cost about the same as a land cruiser jeep the reason is that the cars have to be custom made
8562899 the cars are primarily rented by tourists who are extremely ecologically minded although they are also very popular with journalists the drawback is that there is currently only one hydrogen filling station in the country which means that customers can only travel 160 km before needing to refuel
8562900 in iceland either geothermal energy or hydroelectric power is used to fuel the production of hydrogen fuel but many countries have ample amounts of wind energy or solar power that can be used for powering hydrogen fuel production
8562901 i know that there are criticisms from some environmentalists about the production of hydrogen from fuels such as natural gas but because the efficiency of hydrogen as a fuel is approximately 40 percent rather than the 18 25 percent for petrol or diesel hydrogen still works out as a better option
8562902 altogether there have been nine student projects over the last four years there are currently two students but we expect the number to increase in the near future
8562903 but it is important to make clear that this is not government policy
8562904 they the government support various tests and demonstrations and expect a well informed market to pick the most viable choice for locally made fuel types and although we test the cars if they are not satisfactory on our terms we may send them back we do not have the financial resources to test more than this number of cars

8562954 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8562955 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results

8563003 the flurry of activity of the nato naval forces which continue building up their grouping in the black sea arouses suspicion
8563004 moreover we have learned that eight more nato warships are to arrive shortly
8563005 what is the purpose of all this references are being made to scheduled exercises and indeed one can see some legitimacy in this
8563006 but these eight warships expected to arrive in the black sea will carry cargoes of a different kind not humanitarian aid

8563039 the center of the project is writing and collaboration using social media technologies the devices are just tools that will get us there ultimately we want the technology part of it to be completely transparent to be at once invisible and indispensable
8563040 the web 2 0 technologies at the heart of the project are both easy to use and ubiquitously accessible which we believe removes complexity breaks down barriers and extends the classroom beyond its four walls
8563041 the umds asus eeepcs are far less expensive and more durable than traditional laptops which we expect will extend their usable life in the hands of elementary school students their linux based user interface is ideal for practical student use and will free our teachers from having to teach support complex operating systems allowing them to focus instead on tasks and goals

8563105 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
8563106 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
8563107 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible
8563108 but the insane thing is that we are talking now about investing millions into tapping into a resource under the ground when the real tragedy is that every week were still dumping tons and tons of plastic into more landfills its an act of vandalism against the environment
8563109 dit is een prachtig initiatief wat zeker moet gaan groeien het concept staat het is nu aan de clubs in deze regio om hun schouders er onder te zetten en dit tot een groot succes te maken

8563118 la stagione partita benissimo a vallelunga dove ho ottenuto la vittoria conquistando anche la vetta della classifica che sino ad ora nelle mie mani a spa francorchamps speravo di fare un po meglio del terzo posto ma considerando che sono arrivato alle spalle di pastor maldonado e davide rigon uno pilota gp2 laltro campione delleuroseries 3000 lo scorso anno con il quale ho intrapreso una bella battaglia per la piazza donore posso ritenermi comunque soddisfatto a valencia e al mugello ho accusato dei problemi causa un piccolo infortunio che ho sub to in allenamento alla spalla che non mi ha permesso di esprimermi al meglio delle mie possibilit a valencia ho fatto davvero tanta fatica perch mi faceva molto male la spalla mentre al mugello ho avuto anche un inconveniente in qualifica con un incendio elettrico non riuscendo a portare a termine la lotta per la pole position nella gara toscana con grande determinazione sono ugualmente riuscito a portare a termine la corsa in seconda posizione cosa che mi ha fatto molto piacere e ha ripagato anche il team per il lavoro svolto
8563119 senza questo problema alla spalla sarei certamente riuscito a raccogliere di pi per posso accontentarmi di quello che fino a qui ho ottenuto mantenendo la vetta di entrambi i campionati sia litaliano di f3000 sia leuroseries
8563120 sono sceso in pista con il mio team per provare delle nuove soluzioni andato tutto bene e abbiamo raccolto dati utili in previsione dellappuntamento di misano a settembre siamo soddisfatti abbiamo capito delle cose molto importanti e abbiamo anche ottenuto il secondo miglior tempo di giornata e partiamo abbastanza pronti per questo finale di stagione
8563121 ho sempre deciso di correre allestero sia per avere maggiore esperienza sia per lavorare a stretto contatto con dei team stranieri la scelta delleuroseries 3000 avvenuta per realizzare la volont di guidare una macchina potente ad un prezzo relativamente basso oltre al fatto che la lola b02 50 una vettura che insegna molto dal punto di vista della messa a punto e della guidabilit che mette a dura prova la resistenza fisica del pilota la categoria di per s un bel campionato organizzato molto bene dalla coloni motorsport anche se forse non c un gran numero di iscritti che ne aumenterebbe la visibilit e renderebbe molto pi divertenti le gare
8563122 certamente un grosso cambiamento passare da un team di formula renault ad uno di gp2 tancredi pagiaro il team manager molto organizzato e tiene molto al suo team cosa che mi ha aiutato a crescere entrando in questo ambiente diverso e molto professionale se prima molte cose erano lasciate al caso ora tutto perfettamente organizzato
8563123 vorrei provare sistemata la spalla a fare da qui a fine stagione ottime prestazioni ottenendo in queste ultime quattro gare dei risultati che mi facciano mantenere la vetta del campionato e magari replicare il successo di vallelunga
8563124 sia adam khan che felipe guimaraes a valencia sono stati molto competitivi e prima di loro davide rigon a spa e mi sono arrivati davanti in alcune occasioni credo che probabilmente khan potr darmi filo da torcere e anche nei test di misano si dimostrato molto competitivo e veloce con il quale dovr confrontarmi in pista
8563125 ho fatto due settimane di vacanza per staccare un po la spina e attenuare le tensione e lo stress tornato a milano ho subito ripreso gli allenamenti lavorando anche piuttosto duramente per sopperire in qualche modo al problema della spalla e ora ho due settimane per preparami al massimo per la gara di misano

8563129 everything changed last year on got talent when the guy who won terry fator this ventriloquist went on to sign a 150 million contract with a vegas casino
8563130 so you know the show actually did its job it found a star and its a competition worth winning because if its not worth winning i think the audience gets fed up with these shows
8563131 i think they did a good job last year you know they believed in the guy who won
8563132 when we watch the shows back if i thought they were completely nuts then we wouldnt have them on the show but you know they seem to be making pretty good decisions

8563140 swear allegiance to their constituents and the nation and to pledge to uphold the law
8563141 this seems to me to be an attack upon the state itself the monarch is the one embodiment of the state which is outside the political partisan process
8563142 the people behind this campaign must either oppose the idea of anyone who is non partisan having a role in the affairs of state or they would rather be swearing allegiance to brussels
8563143 recognises that some honourable members would prefer to swear an oath of allegiance to their constituents and the nation rather than the monarch

8563145 swear allegiance to their constituents and the nation and to pledge to uphold the law
8563146 i swear by almighty god that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth her heirs and successors according to law so help me god

8563148 i do solemnly swear to discharge the responsibility required of me to the best of my abilities and faithfully serve the people of wales whom i here represent
8563149 in a democracy allegiance should be to the people and the nation not to a monarch republic is calling on all mps to support the option of a non royal oath of allegiance for everyone whether members of parliament new citizens judges or other public officials
8563150 this campaign is no change really it is old news about 20 years old
8563151 ive always been happy to swear allegiance to the queen i think the monarchy has a traditional and attractive place in british society i will always vote against abolition of the monarchy
8563152 other people get rather obsessed with the whole question its been a very long time since a king or queen sentenced anyone to death so i dont think they present a clear and present danger
8563153 i would be disinclined to campaign for a change there are other important questions like the health service the risk of flooding and so on
8563154 can i make it clear that i believe in the sovereignty of the people of scotland rather than a monarch

8563376 any disclosure however limited would seriously undermine this principle to the point that future cooperation between the uk and its most valuable intelligence partner the us would be severely jeopardised
8563377 it was accepted on behalf of the foreign secretary that bm binyam mohamed had established an arguable case i that over the period april 2002 to may 2004 he was first held by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer or a court or tribunal in pakistan and then detained there or elsewhere by the united states until his arrival in guant namo bay in september 2004 ii that he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the united states during such detention and iii that he was subject to torture during such detention by or on behalf of the united states
8563378 the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
8563379 that on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the sys security service facilitated it in the manner and to the extent described
8563380 conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least may 2002 the court also concluded that the security service continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
8563381 uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
8563382 if it is correct that in the course of an interrogation in which material supplied by the defendant the british government was employed the claimant binyam mohamed was tortured then it is arguable that there is an obligation to disclose material which may assist claimant in establishing before the american military court that he was tortured whether the court should exercise its discretion not to order disclosure can only be determined at a full hearing
8563383 could be considered exculpatory or might otherwise be relevant in the context of proceedings before the military commissions
8563384 the united kingdom armed forces are trained in the laws of armed conflict set out in the geneva conventions the joint services intelligence organisations training documentation states that the following techniques are expressly and explicitly forbidden a physical punishment of any sort b the use of stress positions c intentional sleep deprivations d withdrawal of food water or medical treatment and three other specified techniques
8563385 must have appreciated that it rendition was contrary to the rule of law
8563386 however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection
8563387 hooding withholding of blankets and sleep deprivation of a detainee in afghanistan
8563388 a united states official had referred to getting a detainee ready which appeared to involve sleep deprivation hooding and the use of stress positions
8563389 with regard to the status of the prisoners under the various geneva conventions and protocols all prisoners however they are described are entitled to the same levels of protection you have commented on their treatment it appears from your description that they may not be being treated in accordance with the appropriate standards given that they are not within our custody or control the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this that said hmgs her majestys government stated commitment to human rights makes it important that the americans understand that we cannot be party to such ill treatment nor can we be seen to condone it
8563390 what is clear is that b triples have been operating in victoria on victorian roads now for 13 years without incident
8563391 following that successful trial what were encouraging governments to do is to have a network identified for the use of b triples which are higher productivity and safer vehicles
8563392 this was the secret plan that they were keeping from communities this was the plan that was going to be buried in a transport plan in november
8563393 the higher oil price doesnt help the transport sector either

8563395 we have undertaken major reforms to improve our internal processes with the aim of bringing better coordination to the foreign assistance we provide throughout the world
8563396 accra is a vital stepping stone in u s efforts to build on and re energize our mission to ensure that aid is effective
8563397 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8563398 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8563399 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8563400 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8563401 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8563402 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8563403 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8563404 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8563405 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8563406 the vehicle was going to pick up prisoners and as it reached a bridge an explosive laden car exploded and nine of our policemen and two passers by were killed
8563407 we are still on track the process has speeded up and governments are very serious about negotiating a result in copenhagen
8563408 the highlight of this session is that governments have agreed to compile different proposals for solutions in a structured way for discussion at the next landmark meeting in poznan
8563409 so accra has laid the foundation of what could serve as a first negotiating text for a copenhagen deal
8563410 countries have made it very clear that issue of forests need to be part of a copenhagen deal
8563411 thats important because emissions from deforestation account for 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions
8563412 parties were deeply committed and submitted proposals for solutions on the issues
8563413 all in all the group has made good progress its important to take this progress forward in pozna when we return to the issue of the ranges of emissions reductions for developed countries under the kyoto protocol
8563414 one of the cdms shortcomings is that it is not leading to enough investments in africa
8563415 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that take into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth
8563416 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see

8563419 she loved the royal family and looked back with great fondness
8563420 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8563421 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8563422 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8563423 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8563424 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8563425 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8563426 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8563430 the high command was in touch with me since yesterday
8563431 i was watching their hands especially mendis my plan was that if i can read his hand i can play well that was the game plan
8563432 i think i was able to read both murali and mendis well scoring 76 and helping my team win is satisfying
8563433 whenever we are at the nets or batting together he tells me how to plan he is such a class reader of the game he always plays with responsibility we learn a lot from him while batting with him it is good we got partnerships in two matches
8563434 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8563435 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8563436 as a mark of solidarity with the innocent people in orissa who have been targeted all christian run schools and colleges in the country would be closed on friday
8563437 we will ask the prime minister for payment of immediate relief to victims and their rehabilitation we will also seek for corrective actions so that no more churches or schools are targeted in the state
8563438 governance in orissa state appears to have disintegrated some people have called the violence hindu christian clashes but this is not accurate innocent christians mostly of dalit origin continue to be attacked by communal organisations which are mocking the rule of law
8563439 we are delighted to re launch kotak term and kotak preferred term with reduced rates we believe that for an under insured country like india cheaper term plans will help increase penetration of insurance products
8563440 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8563441 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8563442 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8563443 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8563444 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8563445 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8563446 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8563447 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8563448 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8563449 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer

8563455 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8563456 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8563457 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8563458 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8563459 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

8563468 declaration of war against the americans occupying the land of the two holy places
8563469 i beleive that airport security is currently profiling however they are profiling the wrong people the muslims that wear the turbins and long veils are the true muslims the law abiding allah worshiping muslims the people that should be targeted are the ones without the custom clothing and markings these are the ones that come into other countries with the intent to kill the radical islamist dress and act like a non muslim in hopes of blending in and therefore having a better chance of completing their objective these are the ones that need to be stopped
8563470 allah is their objective the prophet is their leader the quran is their law jihad is their way and dying in the way of allah is their highest hope
8563471 muslims should remove from america immediately the civilians of american and their children depend on it
8563472 the war on terror is a challenging subject to discuss with muslim audiences because our community is divided on the issue of whether or not any muslims were involved in 9 11 and whether al qaeda is real
8563473 these are significant issues because if muslims were not involved in 9 11 and if al qaeda is not real then the

8563479 we hang the petty thieves while we appoint the great ones to public office
8563480 declaration of war against the americans occupying the land of the two holy places
8563481 do you consider yourself to be a muslim first an american first or both equally
8563482 the intense attention paid to muslims in the aftermath of 9 11 may have made them more reluctant to cooperate with a survey request from an unknown caller
8563483 is the american government at war with the religion of islam
8563484 did muslims hijack planes and fly them into buildings on 9 11
8563485 the intense attention paid to muslims in the aftermath of 9 11 may have made them more reluctant to cooperate with a survey request from an unknown caller
8563486 did the u s government have advance knowledge of the 9 11 attacks and allow the attacks to occur
8563487 did the u s government organize the 9 11 attacks
8563488 are the tapes of osama bin laden claiming responsibility for the 9 11 attacks and threatening future attacks real or fake
8563489 did muslims commit the july 2005 train and bus bombings in london
8563490 the canadian government says it stopped a plot by canadian muslims in june 2006 to attack targets in canada do you believe there was a real plot by muslims
8563491 the british government says it stopped a plot by british muslims in august 2006 to bomb planes flying to america do you believe there was a real plot by muslims
8563492 is al qaeda a real organization operated by muslims who are trying to attack america
8563493 is al qaeda attacking america because al qaeda hates american freedoms
8563494 is al qaeda attacking america because al qaeda hates american involvement in the muslim world
8563495 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america a taking religion and ethnicity into account as one factor when deciding whom to interview and search at airports
8563496 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america b monitoring activities at american mosques
8563497 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america c listening to phone calls of people in america whom the government claims are connected in some way with al qaeda
8563498 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america d having an informer pretend to support or encourage violence against america to see if the targeted muslims will decide to attack american targets
8563499 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america e monitoring muslim charities in america in the hopes of preventing funding for possible terrorist attacks
8563500 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america f focusing immigration amp customs enforcement resources on deporting muslim illegal aliens who have not been convicted of terrorism in the hopes of disrupting possible al qaeda attacks
8563501 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america g allowing muslim illegal aliens to stay in america if they agree to work as informants monitoring the muslim community for the government
8563502 is it justifiable for the u s government to do any of the following in an attempt to prevent terrorist attacks in america h torturing suspected al qaeda members to get information about possible planned attacks
8563503 do you believe that your local mosque is being monitored by wiretaps government agents or informants
8563504 do you believe that your personal phone calls are being listened to or that your personal mail or email is being read by the u s government
8563505 do you believe that your home is bugged by the u s government
8563506 do you believe that the u s government has secretly searched your home
8563507 if you or a member of your family have been questioned by the federal government at any time after 9 11 how were you treated during the interview
8563508 should america attack iran to stop iran from developing nuclear weapons
8563509 should american troops leave iraq immediately or stay there until the iraqi government and iraqi military are stronger
8563510 is violence by muslims against american civilians acceptable in retaliation for the american governments actions in the muslim world
8563511 is violence by muslims against the american military overseas acceptable in retaliation for the american governments actions in the muslim world
8563512 is violence by muslims against the american military in the u s acceptable in retaliation for the american governments actions in the muslim world
8563513 is violence by muslims against american government officials acceptable in retaliation for the american governments actions in the muslim world
8563514 if you learned about a plot by muslims to attack targets inside america would you tell law enforcement authorities
8563515 efforts by extremists to obtain training inside the u s is also an ongoing concern although there are multiple reports and ongoing investigations associated with the paramilitary training activities of suspected extremists nationwide the majority of these cases involve small groups of like minded individuals who are inspired by the jihadist rhetoric experienced in radical mosques or prison proselytizing
8563516 in general mosques and other houses of worship do not have special protection from surveillance under u s law since the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks several federal investigations have used informants surveillance and electronic eavesdropping to gather information about mosques
8563517 fight in the cause of allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits for allah loveth not transgressors and slay them wherever ye catch them and turn them out from where they have turned you out for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter but fight them not at the sacred mosque unless they first fight you there but if they fight you slay them such is the reward of those who suppress faith but if they cease allah is oft forgiving most merciful and fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in allah but if they cease let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression
8563518 fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it but it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you and that ye love a thing which is bad for you but allah knoweth and ye know not they ask thee concerning fighting in the prohibited month say fighting therein is a grave offence but graver is it in the sight of allah to prevent access to the path of allah to deny him to prevent access to the sacred mosque and drive out its members tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter nor will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can
8563519 and why should ye not fight in the cause of allah and of those who being weak are ill treated and oppressed
8563520 on that account we ordained for the children of israel that if any one slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole people and if any one saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people
8563521 say to the unbelievers if now they desist from unbelief their past would be forgiven them but if they persist the punishment of those before them is already a matter of warning for them and fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in allah altogether and everywhere but if they cease verily allah doth see all that they do
8563522 but the treaties are not dissolved with those pagans with whom ye have entered into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught nor aided any one against you so fulfil your engagements with them to the end of their term for allah loveth the righteous but when the forbidden months are past then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them and seize them beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war but if they repent and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity then open the way for them for allah is oft forgiving most merciful
8563523 fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued
8563524 o ye who believe fight the unbelievers who gird you about and let them find firmness in you and know that allah is with those who fear him
8563525 to those against whom war is made permission is given to fight because they are wronged and verily allah is most powerful for their aid they are those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right for no cause except that they say our lord is allah
8563526 islam as a religion is neither pacifist nor does it incite to war for the sake of making war what is much more significant is the endorsement of the basic principle of reciprocity if muslims are treated fairly very few muslims would understand the quran as allowing violence
8563527 the problem is accepting the notion that muslims are defined by texts
8563528 hey my dear american buddy i know that some muslims around the world point to some quranic texts to justify their use of violence but that is their interpretation and i think their interpretation is wrong this is what i think and i want you to know that muslims disagree with each other on many issues and interpretations of the quran
8563529 okay for a muslimto lie if it was for the greater good
8563530 what brought me to the government was after 9 11 muslim scholars in saudi arabia and morocco said it was incumbent on muslims to stop terrorists
8563531 anyone involved in terrorism was deemed the brother of the devil
8563532 beware of suspicion for suspicion is the falsest of speech do not eavesdrop do not spy on one another do not envy one another do not forsake one another do not hate one another be o slaves of allah brothers
8563533 it is the civic and religious duty of muslims to cooperate with law enforcement authorities to protect the lives of all civilians
8563534 we are closer to our servant than the juglar vein or even nearer
8563535 i know that most americans think that those muslims started this war if you look at the history this is not true and it is also not true that this war was started because muslims cannot accept americans being free or having a democracy the grievances started due to american foreign policy primarily the u s government for support of tyrannies in the muslim world and the u s government support of israel
8563536 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we just let in one probable suicide bombing supporter and one or two others willing to kill servicemen here 2 or 3 more who wouldnt mind seeing our troops abroad get killed
8563537 killed 8 million gypsies jews and homosexuals for the crime of being born
8563538 invented the most efficient means of death and destruction known to man
8563539 begun numerous wars of choice including iraq which has killed at least half a million iraqi civilians
8563540 and yet it is muslims who are somehow a threat to the world what a curious worldview to have
8563541 the best thing is to let christianity die a natural death when understanding of the universe has become widespread christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity christianity has reached the peak of absurdity and thats why someday its structure will collapse the only way to get rid of christianity is to allow it to die little by little christianity the liar well see to it that the churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the state
8563542 the spark that lit the fire was the presence of u
8563543 peace to the secular humanists and atheists simply means non violence or a lack of war which i would add has no moral basis whatsoever in their religion of
8563544 we dont see any religious movement other than islam engaged in expanding its reach through violence
8563545 obviously the war in bosnia never took place because your friends on these comments have informed all of us that christians never kill in the name of religion so who exactly were you saving the bosnians from
8563546 do not befriend them but instead slay them if they refuse the dawa or conversion to islam that you offer them
8563547 do you believe that it is ok for a christian to physically attack or kill us muslims on the basis of actions taken by islamics in other countries
8563548 but its a far cry from some dirt bag running into a crowded marketplace and blowing up a bunch of women and children
8563549 the argument was made that christians may kill people but they never say they are killing people because of religion
8563550 too bad islam didnt have the foresight to reform itself like christianity did ie new testament
8563551 what would the christian result look like if they were asked a similar question of their layalties christian or american first
8563552 too bad islam didnt have the foresight to reform itself like christianity did ie new testament
8563553 old testament was a temporary covenant which would end with the death of jesus christ and a new covenant would then begin old testament mosaic law much like the present day koran getting to the promised land by following strict laws new testament grace no islamic equivalent getting to the promised land by salvation alone
8563554 you claim that christianity reformed itself well ch did reform itself but that was the reformation
8563555 again if i contributed to that with my lgf bozo remark
8563556 you claim that christianity reformed itself well ch did reform itself but that was the reformation
8563557 hamas has largely abided by an informal cease fire with israel since early 2005
8563558 arguments by those who believe the u s should deny aid to the hamas government
8563559 arguments by those who believe the u s should provide aid to the hamas government
8563560 arguments by those who believe the u s should deny aid to the hamas government
8563561 hostility and hate have come between us forever unless you believe in allah only
8563562 what is even scarier is how many non muslim americans are paranoid and scared
8563563 verily in the messenger of allah you have a good example for him who looks unto allah and the last day
8563564 we sent not a messenger but to be obeyed in accordance with the will of allah
8563565 say swear not obedience is more reasonable say obey allah and obey the messenger
8563566 verily those who swear allegiance to you muhammad indeed swear their allegiance to allah
8563567 in discipline training morale equipment and general competence his nassers army and the other arab forces without the direct assistance of the soviet union are no match for the israelis even with 50 000 troops and the best of his generals and air force in yemen he has not been able to work his way in that small and primitive country and even his effort to help the congo rebels was a flop
8563568 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8563569 let the one who has no sin cast the first stone
8563570 how can you enslave people when in fact their mothers gave birth to them as free
8563571 he who takes the life of one human is as if he killed all of humanity and he who saves one is as if he saved all of humanity
8563572 he who takes the life of one human is as if he killed all of humanity and he who saves one is as if he saved all of humanity
8563573 declaration of war against the americans occupying the land of the two holy places
8563574 when us kills civilians others will do the same to us
8563575 declaration of war against the americans occupying the land of the two holy places
8563576 sixty years of western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the middle east did nothing to make us safe because in the long run stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty as long as the middle east remains a place where freedom does not flourish it will remain a place of stagnation resentment and violence ready for export and with the spread of weapons that can bring catastrophic harm to our country and to our friends it would be reckless to accept the status quo therefore the united states has adopted a new policy a forward strategy of freedom in the middle east
8563577 what are you going to do kill us all bulldoze all our homes remove us from the earth
8563578 well how can they strike back if they dont know who did it
8563579 named countless targets inside the u s to stop the pain all of them immaterial
8563580 any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person
8563581 no physical or mental torture nor any other form of coercion may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind
8563582 the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution or crucifixion or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land that is their disgrace in this world and a heavy punishment is theirs in the hereafter except for those who repent before they fall into your power in that case know that allah is oft forgiving most merciful
8563583 the reports describe friendly contacts and indicate some common themes in both sides hatred of the united states but to date we have seen no evidence that these or the earlier contacts ever developed into a collaborative operational relationship nor have we seen any evidence indicating that iraq cooperated with al qaeda in developing or carrying out any attacks against the united states
8563584 the reports describe friendly contacts and indicate some common themes in both sides hatred of the united states
8563585 i hereby declare on oath that i absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince potentate state or sovereignty of whom or which i have heretofore been a subject or citizen that i will support and defend the constitution and laws of the united states of america against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion so help me god
8563586 declaration of war against the americans occupying the land of the two holy places
8563587 the ruling to kill the americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the al aqsa mosque and the holy mosque from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim
8563588 targeting civilians life and property through suicide bombings or any other method of attack is haram or forbidden
8563589 on that account we ordained for the children of israel that if any one slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole people and if any one saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people
8563590 o ye who believe the law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder the free for the free the slave for the slave the woman for the woman but if any remission is made by the brother of the slain then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with handsome gratitude this is a concession and a mercy from your lord after this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty
8563591 the prohibited month for the prohibited month and so for all things prohibited there is the law of equality if then anyone transgresses the prohibition against you transgress ye likewise against him but fear allah and know that allah is with those who restrain themselves
8563592 if ye punish then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted but if ye endure patiently verily it is better for the patient
8563593 they send their sons to armies to fight us and they continue their financial and moral support while our countries are burned and our houses are bombed and our people are killed
8563594 allah gives permission in the koran for the followers of allah to attack those who have raged war against them with the expectation of eternal paradise in case of martyrdom and or living ones life in obedience of all of allahs commandments found throughout the qurans 114 chapters
8563595 the u s government is responsible for the deaths of and the torture of countless followers of allah my brothers and sisters my attack on americans at unc ch on march 3rd was in retaliation for similar attacks orchestrated by the u s government on my fellow followers of allah in iraq afghanistan palestine saudi arabia and other islamic territories i did not act out of hatred for americans but out of love for allah instead
8563596 defense of muslims or retaliation for acts committed against muslims
8563597 this is a warning to those who disbelieve that we are here for you and i am ready to give my life
8563598 this tape is to let you guys know who disbelieve in allah to let the enemies of islam know and to let the muslims alike know that the time for jihad is now
8563599 what brought me to the government was after 9 11 muslim scholars in saudi arabia and morocco said it was incumbent on muslims to stop terrorists
8563600 anyone involved in terrorism was deemed the brother of the devil
8563601 with such challenges in the marketplace we continue to focus on innovation as a key driver of our brand equity and volume growth
8563602 our speciality beer portfolio continues to grow with the newly launched draught paulaner showing very encouraging results and the mexican beer sol and italian moretti also showing very promising potential
8563603 we believe that heinekens first half results are not as bad as feared given a strong top line the outlook for 2008 is very cautious though but provides room to over deliver
8563604 they should leave because the court has issued arrest warrants
8563605 police can legitimately use a minimum of force if they resist or are armed
8563606 i ask protesters of the pad to please withdraw from the government house compound immediately you can rally somewhere else
8563607 if you want to arrest us come here and arrest us here it is the government who must go
8563608 we going to wait here and wait for them to come in and get us
8563609 the numbers are increasing probably because children are more aware of the service and more able to contact it because they have mobile phones but it also shows a serious underlying problem
8563610 our busiest times are evenings and at weekends when social services are not available we need a proper out of hours support system for children
8563611 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8563612 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8563613 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8563614 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8563615 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8563616 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8563617 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8563618 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america
8563619 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8563620 the full year consensus expectation is for us to deliver something around mid double digit growth 14 to 15 and were on track to do that
8563621 international joint ventures are expected to sustain their improved first half performance
8563622 we expect this business to sustain its improved performance for the second half delivering an overall satisfactory performance for the year
8563623 i think we can help avoid this by making sure the emotional needs of child patients are appropriately answered and that hospitals do not suffer from staff shortages or time worn facilities
8563624 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8563625 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8563626 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8563627 however the airport intends to increase the cost from a 100 discount to an 80 discount
8563628 in fairness to the lads in cork they would happily do a deal with us but they are being told by the dublin airport authority you must increase the costs
8563629 as a result of that we are closing the two routes that means from the end of november cork will lose 100 000 passengers on those two routes alone in winter it will lose 200 000 over a full 12 month period and that will result in a drop in tourism revenues of 200 000 annually and that is the equivalent of 200 local jobs lost in the supporting areas
8563630 yet again cork airport is losing out due to a decision of dublin airport
8563631 at meetings with caa they have said if it was their decision they would simply extend the cost base but were being told by dublin and the boss of the daa declan collier no changes no discount no extension to the discount arrangement the rules that apply in dublin are simply being imposed on cork it is another extension of the way daa is run to discriminate against cork and shannon
8563632 all airlines are eligible to apply for route support through the route support scheme when introducing new destinations
8563633 its a challenging market but were performing strongly and are growing market share in the life and pensions business and fund management businesses
8563634 in the life business for example sales in the retail division are down due to the reduced demand for investment products as equity markets have fallen but sales in our corporate business division products increased by 12 in the first six months and have underpinned an actual rise in the total pension sales
8563635 for the year as a whole were targeting low single digit balance sheet growth
8563636 thats down due to two factors firstly new lending activity has reduced as weve responded to the continuing credit crunch and withdrawing from a number of market sectors and product lines
8563637 there has been an issue with regard to irish tourism over the last couple of years in relation to value for money and the issue has been primarily the cost of eating and drinking out in ireland
8563638 the restaurant sector is beset by a really high cost and would say its a struggle for them to maintain any reasonable margin and then on the other hand you have people saying theres a bit of a rip off culture with people being overcharged were trying to look at what are the actual elements involved in putting a standard meal on the table
8563639 as a development agency what we want to look at is are there certain policy issues relating to the regulatory burden to labour costs to any of the elements is there any one of those that we should be taking a position on if certain things were done that might be able to take away the cost elements or reduce some of the burden
8563640 people arent saying at the moment i wouldnt go to ireland its too expensive what they probably are saying is we had a wonderful holiday it was a bit expensive but that is manageable but it can become unmanageable
8563641 this is our one shot so we have to roll up our sleeves or risk another four or eight years of the same disastrous bush mccain policies
8563642 i think republicans are very heartened by this convention everything seems to have not gone the way they have planned it
8563643 i am john kerry and i am reporting for duty
8563644 i think we will see a time when posters of the president is on walls in mud huts and up mountains around the world in the way john kennedy was
8563645 the country is looking to see if this guy is going to change the terrible path we are on if he makes a convincing argument the party is primed to respond
8563646 kerrys speech in 2004 was not great it was very defensive responding to republican attacks on the democratic party
8563647 but when you look at his policies is he for change when he wants a larger military budget
8563648 is he for change when he doesnt challenge the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies for corporations
8563649 the two parties display a difference that can be described as the different velocity with which their knees hit the floor when corporations bang on their doors
8563650 a lot of people like myself are very disillusioned with only having two centrist candidates to choose from
8563651 neither partys candidates are talking about issues that are important to me
8563652 basically what hes saying is im going to make peace with corporations so why should i talk to nader
8563653 when democrats try to beat republicans by becoming more like them by blurring the differences
8563654 we expect the next move in the bank rate to be down but the extent to which this will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low
8563655 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8563656 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8563657 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8563658 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8563659 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8563660 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8563661 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8563662 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8563663 perguntei a ela se era do porcaria que eles n o tinham gostado ent o ofereci trocar para lloyds um lixo mas eles tamb m n o aceitaram
8563664 n o sou t o grato pela oportunidade de discursar ap s o magn fico pronunciamento dela hillary ontem noite mas farei o melhor que puder hillary disse em termos nada amb guos que ela far de tudo para eleger barack obama ent o somos dois na verdade somos 18 milh es porque como hillary quero que todos voc s que a apoiaram votem em barack obama em novembro
8563665 juntos n s prevalecemos em uma campanha na qual os republicanos disseram que eu era jovem demais e inexperiente demais para ser comandante em chefe soa familiar n o funcionou em 1992 porque est vamos do lado certo da hist ria e n o vai funcionar em 2008 porque barack obama est do lado certo da hist ria
8563666 eles querem que n s os recompensemos pelos ltimos oito anos ao dar lhes mais quatro anos afirmou emendando em seguida que o pa s inteiro deveria enviar uma mensagem aos republicanos obrigado mas n o obrigado
8563667 muito unilateralismo e pouca coopera o uma perigosa depend ncia do petr leo importado e uma recusa em assumir a lideran a no combate ao aquecimento global e um constante fracasso em fazer uso da diplomacia desde o oriente m dio at a frica e a am rica latina passando pela europa central e o leste europeu

8563672 the world began without the human race and it will end without it
8563673 revolutions are the periods of history when individuals count most
8563674 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8563675 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8563676 you either do something about it or you stick your head in the sand
8563677 i think we all had fun once we knew it was all safe
8563678 theres nothing about the tests that is designed to create anxiety or create a sense of evaluation or create a sense of being compared to someone else
8563679 once the information is available the potential exists for school administrators to use it to track students and make premature assessments
8563680 were teaching kids how to get the right answers not how to find the knowledge
8563681 tells us all that there has been a changing of the guard it just feels like its time to pass the torch the convention has to be by obamas rules his way and he has to be the leading director
8563682 its about a whole new generation stepping up and a whole new generation checking in
8563683 the hunger for leadership positive leadership is so great were willing to look past things that used to get in the way
8563684 the pragmatism of who youre trying to get to vote for you and a generational shift
8563685 you still have to do in group politics but you have to work hard to broaden your appeal and appear non racial
8563686 i think thats what obama is struggling with how to be a black leader and the american president at the same time
8563687 they dont have the strength and the power they once did because of the line people
8563688 the crews they have out there is where they are lacking its a different generation theyre not as smart about how they involve themselves in supporting the family
8563689 has less of a talent pool to pull from because of ethnic neighborhoods disappearing
8563690 they are a shell of what the organization was years ago
8563691 do they get as much respect no but everybody is surviving
8563692 the only time ive ever heard that is in the papers
8563693 you ask anybody about me we straighten out a lot of beefs a lot of things
8563694 the mob is all about opportunity any chance to make money they are going to take it
8563695 carmens downfall is he was a good friend of this guy and he never suspected this guy would do this to him
8563696 the guys now want to appear to be tony soprano
8563697 you spend your life wondering about whether your friend wants to kill you or hurt you or whether some law enforcement officer wants to put you in jail
8563698 a lot of them have gambling problems and are low end scam guys
8563699 it has a very big potential to change drastically in new england over the next several years or it can stay the same course
8563700 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8563701 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8563702 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama had been proven right
8563703 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8563704 it is with great pride that i announce that barack obama is the democratic nominee for the president of the united states
8563705 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8563706 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8563707 divisive politics that is all about tearing people down instead of lifting this country up
8563708 senator obama tries to elevate the dialogue in this country
8563709 by no means will joe biden take it in the gutter but what he will do is point out the clear distinctions between the parties
8563710 joe biden is right we need more than a good soldier we need a leader with the experience and judgment to serve as commander in chief from day one that leader is john mccain
8563711 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up together
8563712 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready and barack obama is ready
8563713 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11
8563714 first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
8563715 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and jill biden and son beau biden and mama biden and the whole biden family with me on this journey to take america back
8563716 having been poor is no shame but being ashamed of it is
8563717 immigration is a very hot topic every time i go to wal mart i have constituents approach
8563718 now i have something to tell them thank you rep looper i can tell them to call you yes we have a serious shortage of illiterate peasants in america 10 20 million or more is not enough
8563719 we can close this deficiency by passing co hb 1325 the alien importation act of 2008 as with foreign oil lets increase our dependency on foreign labor
8563720 do you recall the defend colorado now immigration petition in 2006
8563721 all those mean colorado citizens wanted to take welfare state benefits away from our foreign cousins visiting us here from our extended world family
8563722 now a second branch of state government our responsive legislature is also heeding the public will
8563723 you say americans dont want this seasonal work at any wage
8563724 no wonder since the cato institute estimated about eight years ago that the cash value of colorados total welfare benefits was the equivalent of 10 05 per hour eight years later its probably closer to 14 per hour pretty good income for doing nothing
8563725 why work when government will pay you not to work
8563726 here we can show our international compassion and at the same time prop up the welfare state entitlements that created the wage rate distortion such a deal
8563727 obviously we cant use prison labor to pick crops as other states do
8563728 the convicts might object or get calluses on their hands or they might eat too much of the crops they are picking and contribute to our obesity crisis we wouldnt want that on our conscience
8563729 we cant let free market labor pricing work that is too radical a concept
8563730 once we implement this brilliant program for agriculture can manufacturing construction and other labor sectors be far behind
8563731 maybe we could also import our politicians we couldnt do worse
8563732 look how successful this program has been in germany and other parts of europe which now are overflowing with turkish greek and other immigrants angrily creating their own subcultures
8563733 we have plenty of examples of the results of our immigration tolerance both legal and illegal
8563734 nice foreign national who came to colorado illegally to serve you
8563735 hb 1325 is an ingenious solution to the illegal alien problem
8563736 it makes them legal because government gives them a piece of paper
8563737 of course over the next five years these 15 000 aliens will all go home when requested for sure we promise
8563738 how do we know because hb 1325 plans it that way and all laws work as intended right also we have their promises on paper no one will skip out and disappear in the vast underground of our growing and anonymous subculture
8563739 just because we already have more than 10 20 million examples to the contrary doesnt mean our failed immigration policy wont work this time besides theres always the next amnesty
8563740 democrats should support this bill even though it is a precedent to further undermine organized labor after all when the next amnesty comes these people are expected to register and vote democrat
8563741 republicans should support this bill to maintain their image of exploiting the little guy on behalf of big business another win win win for our noble and responsive political system
8563742 from the halls of congress we learn that the social service costs for just the illegal aliens is upwards of 436 billion annually
8563743 these figures are relevant to this bill because we will be importing our guests from the segment of third world foreign societies that provides the same people who now invade illegally we just bring them here first we thwart their illegality by legalizing it ta da
8563744 the america i knew growing up did not have these problems
8563745 we naively believed america had borders for a reason and that we were not the dumping ground for other countries workers trading their failed political economic and social systems for our own
8563746 yes colleagues we can pass this bill as a responsive tribute to the more than 12 to 20 million enterprising aliens now roaming around america
8563747 there are a lot of us who emotionally would love to do it
8563748 but its really chris call chris is the kind of film maker who just doesnt think about the next movie before he has completely finished the movie he is working on
8563749 when he comes back we will see how he feels
8563750 i have wanted to produce a sports themed movie for some time now
8563751 i think guo jingjing and liu xiang will fit the bill
8563752 era un caracter deosebit iar cei vorbesc f r s l cunoasc mai bine tac pentru sportul i boxul craiovean moartea sa reprezint o pierdere
8563753 put a gun to my head shoot me put me in a box and bury me because if you dont ill come back and come back ill never give up until i get where i want to go
8563754 se i numeri fossero confermati sarebbe una tragedia del mare equiparabile per il numero delle perdite a un disastro aereo ai sopravvissuti degli incidenti aerei si forniscono cure mediche e supporto psicologico mentre ai migranti e ai richiedenti asilo non si applica la stessa prassi ci auguriamo

8563767 the idea of the environment isnt something thats only in science it has a direct connection with social studies
8563768 were teaching kids about science and in a lot of our discussion today in current affairs and current trends were trying to be more energy efficient
8563769 its just kind of a way of life now and to promote that with our kids is important
8563770 that was a specific personal item of my great grandfather
8563771 i think its very unique for a church to have a room with so many historical items
8563772 i want people to know its here we have a room full of history
8563773 walking up the hill it was like everybody was reaching out a hand wanting to touch you wanting you to touch them wanting to talk to you wanting to have you acknowledge them
8563774 as we came over the hill the crowd kind of erupted in cheering
8563775 i asked our interpreter about it and he said they just want to come see the american doctor and have the american doctor tell them theyre ok
8563776 we sent him to the ship to have his colostomy reversed it changed his life without the surgery he would have had a colostomy for the rest of his life
8563777 those are cases where you just dont know what to say
8563778 they leave and in the back of your mind you know theyre going to die
8563779 being in military life you learn to do as much as you can for as many as you can
8563780 coming from a small community a lot of times you dont know what else is out there
8563781 its really any opportunity to talk about the fact that this stuff is happening
8563782 people think were here to kill and destroy that were out here just to fight wars
8563783 but were really out here to prevent wars and to help people who need it
8563784 my idea of italian cuisine was franco american in a can

8563816 modern ups technology is helping businesses address this issue by providing new ways to reduce power consumption
8563817 for example modular transformerless ups systems can be right sized over time provide higher efficiency for partial loads lower cooling requirements and improved input power factor and input current total harmonic distortion
8563818 this can lead to a need for vast air conditioning installations to operate and cool relatively small data centres
8563819 customers are increasingly seeking modular rack mountable ups solutions not only to maximise system flexibility and availability but to meet wider strategic aims on energy efficiency and environmental compliance
8563820 ups modules are related to a ups system in the same way that individual engines are related to an aircrafts propulsion system
8563821 the two roles of the engines may be regarded as being one for capacity and one for redundancy 1 1 modular ups systems may also have 1 1 and other more complex n 1 and n n capacity redundancy configurations also referred to as parallel redundant configurations
8563822 transformer based ups systems were far too large and heavy to ever become modular
8563823 however light and powerful transformerless three phase upss were perfect for rack mount modular configurations
8563824 by paralleling ups modules in parallel redundant configurations the availability of ups systems and consequently the availability of the critical systems that they support was very significantly enhanced
8563825 hot swappability of modules gives ups systems the ability to continually match their capacity to the size of the critical loads they support this right sizing delivers energy efficiency
8563826 state of the art modular ups systems are best equipped to enable corporations to strike this balance
8563827 today over 70 of the ups systems that we sell are parallel systems three factors have brought this about
8563828 firstly early parallel ups systems required system managers to assign individual ups modules to either capacity roles or redundancy roles
8563829 secondly the relative costs and physical size of ups systems have significantly fallen todays modular 200kva parallel redundant systems have a footprint of less than two computer room floor tiles and an impressive power density of 342kw m2
8563830 the third and final factor is that the business or mission criticality importance of the loads powered by ups systems has increased to the extent that parallel redundancy is no longer a nice to have its an essential

8563834 majority of the cases that have been reported and acted upon by the exchange and the sebi have been too few and the action too late a study of the reported cases on insider trading in securities appellate tribunal sat very clearly reflects a complex web of transactions of unusual nature put through for extraordinary gains by few interested parties however in almost all cases the sebi has not managed to bring the culprit to book for one or the other reason
8563835 you want more insider trading not less you want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that
8563836 i dont know who wrote it but they should have signed it some powerful words this woman should run for president written by a housewife from new jersey and sounds like it this is one ticked off lady are we fighting a war on terror or arent we was it or was it not started by islamic people who brought it to our shores on september 11 2001 were people from all over the world mostly americans not brutally murdered that day in downtown manhattan across the potomac from our nations capitol and in a field in pennsylvania did nearly three thousand men women and children die a horrible burning or crushing death that day or didnt they and im supposed to care that a copy of the koran was desecrated when an overworked american soldier kicked it or got it wet well i dont i dont care at all ill start caring when osama bin laden turns himself in and repents for incinerating all those innocent people on 9 11 ill care about the koran when the fanatics in the middle east start caring about the holy bible the mere possession of which is a crime in saudi arabia ill care when these thugs tell the world they are sorry for chopping off nick bergs head while berg screamed through his gurgling slashed throat ill care when the cowardly so called insurgents in iraq come out and fight like men instead of disrespecting their own religion by hiding in mosques ill care when the mindless zealots who blow themselves up in search of nirvana care about the innocent children within range of their suicide ill care when the american media stops pretending that thei r first amendment liberties are somehow derived from international law instead of the united states constitutions bill of rights in the meantime when i hear a story about a brave marine roughing up an iraqi terrorist to obtain information know this i dont care when i see a fuzzy photo of a pile of naked iraqi prisoners who have been humiliated in what amounts to a college hazing incident rest assured i dont care when i see a wounded terrorist get shot in the head when he is told not to move because he might be booby trapped you can take it to the bank i dont care when i hear that a prisoner who was issued a koran and a prayer mat and fed special food that is paid for by my tax dollars is complaining that his holy book is being mishandled you can absolutely believe in your heart of hearts i dont care and oh by the way ive noticed that sometimes its spelled koran and other times quran well jimmy crack corn and you guessed it i dont care if you agree with this viewpoint pass this on to all your e mail friends sooner or later itll get to the people responsible for this ridiculous behavior if you dont agree then by all means hit the delete button should you choose the latter then please dont complain when more atrocities committed by radical muslims happen here in our great country and may i add some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world but the marines dont have that problem ronald reagan i have another quote that i would like to add and i hope you forward all this if we ever forget that were one nation under god then we will be a nation gone under also by ronald reagan one last thought for the day in case we find ourselves starting to believe all the anti american sentiment and negativity we should remember england s prime minister tony blairs words during a recent interview when asked by one of his parliament members why he believes so much in america he said a simple way to take measure of a country is to look a t how many want in and how many want out only two defining forces have ever offered to die for you 1 one died for your soul the other for your freedom

8563846 ok i was just wondering though im probably still going to call you jesus
8563847 ya know jesus i heard once and i cant remember where from now that a serious inquiry was made of an elderly woman on her conception of the nature of the universe now this wasnt just any old woman though she maintained clear into the 20th century mind you that the earth was flat and supported by turtles when asked what was holding up the first turtle she paused for a moment and then replied another turtle and when the questioning continued her answers remained the same until she finally tired of the enterprise and said impatiently well its turtles all the way down dont you know and that was that there was no convincing her otherwise she knew how things were and she wasnt listenin to nobody who said contrary
8563848 omega youve got the wrong brain man youve gotta go find the old woman before its too late she could die any time now and what if what if the true metaphysics is a system wherein its ego centric human occupants define their own after lives through personal beliefs

8563992 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8563993 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8563994 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8563995 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8563996 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8564005 no one is able to come to me unless the father who has sent me should draw him and i will raise him up in the last day
8564006 unless anyone should be born from above he is not able to see the kingdom of god
8564007 not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to his mercy he saved us through washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy spirit
8564008 blessed is the god and father of our lord jesus christ the one who according to his great mercy has regenerated us again into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
8564009 now if anyone does not have the spirit of christ this one is not of him
8564010 for as many as are being led by the spirit of god these are the sons of god
8564011 the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of god
8564012 examine yourselves if you are in the faith prove your own selves or do you not know your own selves that jesus christ is in you except you are reprobates
8564013 and in this we know that he abides in us from the spirit whom he has given to us
8564014 in this we know that we dwell in him and he in us because he has given to us of his spirit
8564015 the ones who are being kept in the power of god through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
8564016 for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are opposing to one another in order that you should not do what you want
8564017 all that the father gives to me will come to me and the one coming to me i will never cast out
8564018 and this is the will of the father who has sent me in order that of all which he has given to me i should lose nothing but should raise it up in the last day
8564019 and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i am coming to you holy father keep through your own name those whom you have given to me in order that they may be one as we are when i was with them in the world i was keeping them in your name the ones who you have given to me i kept and none of them perished except the son of perdition in order that the scripture might be fulfilled
8564020 were born not from blood nor from the will of the flesh nor from the will of man but from god
8564021 we know that everyone who has been born from god does not practice sin but the one who has been born from god god is keeping him and the evil one does not touch him
8564022 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me 28 and i give to them eternal life and they will never perish forever and not anyone will seize them from out of my hand 29 my father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to seize them from out of the hand of my father
8564023 but to the one being able to keep you without stumbling and to set you before his glory blameless in exultation
8564024 in whom also after having heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after having believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance for redemption of the possession for the praise of his glory
8564025 and do not grieve the holy spirit of god in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption
8564026 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor powers nor any thing which has come nor things coming 39 nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
8564027 little children it is the last hour and according as you heard that antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have come from this we know that it is the last hour they went out from us but they were not of us for if they were of us they would have continued with us but they went out in order that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us

8564032 irish employers want to come out the other side of the credit crunch in a better shape and as a consequence many plan to freeze recruitment or tightening their budgets by instigating redundancies
8564033 wages are the highest cost to a business and so recruitment freezes are considered the ideal resolution to save money however employers should first be looking to tighten their budget in existing areas of the business such as their recycling policies print allowances and even things such as ensuring power is turned off whenever not in use these are all things that can have a significant effect on a company budget

8564088 people in northampton are feeling the pinch of the credit crunch so its unfair that green taxes are set much higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint
8564089 its dishonest for the government to wrap extra unjustified taxes in a green banner when we can ill afford to pay
8564090 green taxes should be linked to cuts in taxes on jobs and income and on less carbon emitting alternatives
8564091 we should be able to choose whether we pay a green tax or not by either using less of a resource or switching to a greener alternative
8564092 a stamp duty rebate or council tax rebate for example could be offered to people who install energy efficiency measures in their homes
8564093 if green tax is not linked to such cuts it wont lead to reduced emissions and is not only grossly unfair but is also pointless
8564094 in 2007 the tpas groundbreaking report the case against further green taxes marked the start of the tide turning against green taxation and was widely credited with preventing the conservative party adopting zac goldsmiths controversial green tax policy proposals
8564095 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8564096 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8564097 the government is talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut

8564099 stand by me nobody knows the way its gonna be
8564100 i sent them the cd and they almost didnt let me send them the money
8564101 specifically because of my song they thought it was about drinking beer and smoking weed when actually if you listen to the song its about getting bored with partying every single night
8564102 they had to take a vote before they were willing to accept my money
8564103 ive already sent them 1000 and hopefully ill be able to send them another 1000 if the cd keeps selling there are various vendors around town who have been gracious enough to sell it for no profit and its just 10 valentinos sells it triple crown lucys ive even got this acupuncture place i set it up at
8564104 i produced it and ive done most of the work im about to do a radio promotion for it also ive got to start to get it played more and to sell a few more would be great
8564105 i played at almost every benefit show the bands were required to play a benefit show to be on the cd thats how i raised money to actually produce the cd the company that i made it through gave me a good cause discount plus they gave me an extra discount to get it done on national fibromyalgia awareness day theres a lot of goodwill that went into the making of this
8564106 ive done other stuff for charity for instance my hair is just getting long again when it gets to more than ten inches long i cut it off and donate it to locks of love
8564107 i love how he puts a positive spin on things

8564109 im just getting a new band together so i havent really been booking shows
8564110 i really like the new group of guys ive got its really hard with bands you know youre not just making music youre trying to get along with them we should start playing again in september

8564147 once the information is available the potential exists for school administrators to use it to track students and make premature assessments
8564148 were teaching kids how to get the right answers not how to find the knowledge
8564149 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8564150 one of the advantages of our method is that it takes into account both people and places
8564151 for instance with unemployment we can say that people who are unemployed are on average happier in an area of high unemployment compared to being unemployed in an area where everyone else around you has a job
8564152 from what ive seen so far my view is that if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8564153 if you live in an area which is very unequal and polarised then you are less likely to have good social networks and friends
8564154 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both
8564155 the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness

8564165 claiming ayers had recruited barack to the board of the annenberg challenge
8564166 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8564167 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8564168 urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8564169 if you look at liverpool sheffield and bristol the levels are low
8564170 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps
8564171 theres also a certain amount of social stigma attached to being obese it may be that these obese people are not going to see their gp
8564172 however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8564173 it is important that people understand both the dangers of obesity and the benefits to their health of losing weight
8564174 even a modest reduction of 5 10 per cent of body weight leads to reduced blood pressure a reduction in the risk of developing diabetes a fall in obesity related cancer deaths and a reduction in total mortality
8564175 we strongly urge anyone who might be at risk to see their gp who can advise them on weight loss options that are tailored to their needs
8564176 earlier this year we published a 372m strategy to tackle obesity recognition of the fact that it is the biggest health challenge we face
8564177 over the last 60 years the number of people who are severely overweight has risen steadily and there is a very real danger that todays children will not live longer than their parents
8564178 as part of the strategy this autumn we will be launching a national movement that will bring about a fundamental change in the way we live our lives
8564179 the change4life movement will not hector or point the finger it will give everyone wherever they live the information and support they need to eat more healthily and be more active
8564180 government cannot do this alone that is why we are inviting everyone from multinational food companies to keep fit clubs in village halls to join our movement and make england healthy

8564208 wer 40 bzw 45 jahre beitr ge bezahlt hat hat sich eine pension schon zum gro en teil selbst finanziert es ist also mehr als gerecht dass die pension nach einer derart langen beitragszeit in voller h he ausbezahlt wird wer lange und schwer gearbeitet hat darf nicht durch niedrigere pensionen bestraft werden ich war selbst mehr als 35 jahre in der privatwirtschaft t tig und tagt glich mit den anliegen und sorgen von arbeitnehmerinnen befasst die schwere oder anstrengende k rperliche arbeit verrichten der sp geht es um gerechte l sungen f r die menschen deshalb wollen wir dass die abschlagsfreie pension f r menschen die 40 bzw 45 jahre gearbeitet haben unbefristet verl ngert wird

8564259 each time they call me the pharmacy calls me or the police department calls me i always tell them one thing pursue the patient and arrest them
8564260 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic

8564264 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and jill biden and beau biden and mama biden and the whole biden family
8564265 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8564266 i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear
8564267 we have the power to change it thats barack obama and thats what he will do for this country
8564268 never give up until we achieve equal pay for women
8564269 ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up
8564270 like many of us barack worked his way up his is a great american story
8564271 as a single parent he decided to be there to put us to bed to be there when we woke up from a bad dream to make us breakfast so hed travel to and from washington four hours a day
8564272 so even though dad worked in washington hes never been part of washington
8564273 he always sounded like the kid from scranton penn that he is
8564274 four years ago i said and ill say it again tonight that the flag doesnt belong to any ideology
8564275 after all patriotism is not love of power or some cheap trick to win votes patriotism is love of country
8564276 how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself how desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesnt put america first
8564277 before he debates obama john mccain should finish the debate for himself
8564278 in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same
8564279 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8564280 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8564281 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8564282 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8564283 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8564284 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8564285 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8564286 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8564287 i love you but we have important work to do tonight
8564288 we cannot afford once again to make the wrong choice or to be taken in by the politics of fear
8564289 denver is where i grew up believing in the american dream and in a country that more than any other is associated with truth justice and freedom
8564290 the opportunity is too great and the stakes too high to allow president obamas agenda to be blocked by the special interests and their allies in the senate
8564291 with eyes firmly fixed on the future with the spirit of unity lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our next president
8564292 my fellow democrats my fellow americans i have never seen a moment like this i have never seen my country as energized as this
8564293 i cant tell you what an honor it is to be here today nominating barack obama and the next president of the united states
8564294 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies who will respect our veterans when they get back home instead of letting them languish without the medical care they deserve
8564295 no matter who you are no matter where youre from anything is possible in our america
8564296 another mother instilled that same dream in her son barack obama
8564297 for barack obama that dream runs deep in his soul
8564298 a president who will make sure that no matter who you are no matter where youre from you too can work hard to achieve the american dream
8564299 i am a proud new yorker a proud woman of color and a proud supporter of hillary rodham clinton

8564323 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
8564324 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
8564325 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
8564326 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function
8564327 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
8564328 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
8564329 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
8564330 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
8564331 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs
8564332 furthermore in the us canada and some parts of europe they are seeing some serious complications which appear to be related to the overuse of some classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that are frequently used there to treat respiratory infections
8564333 we finally have a potential therapy for preventing vision loss from dry amd
8564334 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance
8564335 this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available

8564339 a comprehensive scientifically robust and transparent process has been undertaken in the assessment of the potential environmental impacts of this mine expansion and i have given these matters thorough consideration before making my decision
8564340 in making my assessment i have been particularly concerned that the mine does not adversely affect groundwater values
8564341 the current comprehensive monitoring program will continue and heathgate resources will need to clearly demonstrate that they are having no impact on water quality within the great artesian basin or on aquifers outside the mining lease
8564342 essentially the company has been allowed to expand the area that it is able to do that three or fourfold
8564343 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular
8564344 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8564345 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
8564346 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture
8564347 in der medizinischen literatur steht zwar viel ber die physiologie des verdauungssystems
8564348 aber das meiste davon ist im pharmazeutischen kontext schwer interpretierbar f r uns ist es wichtig parameter wie vorhandenes volumen ph wert pufferkapazit t und ionenst rke verschiedener verdauungsfl ssigkeiten zu kennen und zwar vor w hrend und nach einer mahlzeit denn das hat einen entscheidenden einfluss darauf wie gut ein arzneistoff absorbiert wird
8564349 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role

8564370 the electoral commission has the capacity to conduct the december elections in a professional and transparent manner
8564371 all political actors are committed to respect the rules as set out in the constitution and the electoral law to conduct a clean campaign and to produce credible election results
8564372 the ec should create opportunities for all eligible registrants who through no fault of their own were not able to be register within the ten day limited voter registration exercise or during the two additional days provided due to long queues or long periods of time in various polling centers where limited or no registration materials were available
8564373 the ec in cooperation with the ncce should embark on more effective and timely voter education activities to ensure that citizens are familiar with and understand polling procedures
8564374 the observers visited seven of ghanas ten regions greater accra ashanti central eastern northern volta and western and had permanent teams placed in the greater accra ashanti northern and volta regions throughout the course of their one month observation mission
8564375 in our party we view leadership as the servant of the people and my running mate should have the temperament ability to listen and complement the president in all spheres of governorship
8564376 my selection of a running mate is being guided by my declared intention to form a cabinet with 50 per cent gender sensitivity the nation is ripe for a woman to be at the helm of political leadership
8564377 we should be careful about leaders with doubtful character fraudulent and criminal image in the mind of right thinking people ghana deserves a leader who would project the image of the nation among the community of nations
8564378 i am encouraged by the result of the poll as it calls for hard work and reveals that the pnc has made progress in projecting issues based politics in the country what is left is to link the party with the projection
8564379 we are the only party that has focused on the thematic areas that the ghanaian electorate are calling for education health care agriculture women and children economy youth development national security corruption housing and social welfare
8564380 even though we have a fine message we cannot win the elections
8564381 we are capable of winning the election and offer good leadership
8564382 other flag bearers just copy our manifesto and our message and stand at the rooftops and announce it as their own this is deceptive politics we marketed the national health insurance school feeding programme and the like they hijack it without acknowledging its origin
8564383 now we have talked about one computer to each child university in each region and much more human centred policies our opponents have picked them and are now moving around with these issues
8564384 they npp have not been able to move the country forward in the past eight years when they assumed leadership with fresh men now with tired hands it would be a political disaster to renew their mandate

8564386 2 day course cloud computing managing services that are in the cloud the itil service management way
8564387 there is a lot more to cloud computing than initial thoughts
8564388 i found this an extremely valuable experience to assist my understanding of
8564389 the 3 most useful things i have learnt on this course were positioning of cloud computing and seeing opportunities for use in our organsation
8564390 lately there is a lot of media exposure on cloud computing on demand computing and virtualization most of the presentations and articles focus on the technical side of it presenting the newest generation of vmware or the way virtualization of servers can be organised but what about the other side of the story how do you manage the continuity of the services that make use of could computing how do you ensure consistency in how do you choose the best provider of your on demand computing services and that doesnt even touch on an important side of any it services especially when it uses the cloud for part of the delivery we felt it was an important step to enable us to become a more rounded organisation in terms of it expectations on all of us are increasing and this course gives our clients that additional knowledge to show we are a progressive organisation
8564391 with the right training staff will feel more confident satisfied self reliant and actively communicate more effectively introducing and implementing virtualization and ripple effect throughout a company thus improving morale retention efficiency and productivity
8564392 practical education is at the heart of the art of service

8564394 obama stands for the concerns of the masses in the black community who have been let down by the broken promises of past leadership our leadership on both sides of the aisle has continued to fail us by supporting the war in iraq and by standing by while poverty disparities in our healthcare system and lack of affordable education opportunities for young people weaken our communities it is time to shake loose from the past and senator obamas record shows that he will deliver on his promise to stand up for us in the white house
8564395 on behalf of all the progressive forces of the nation and the world
8564396 there are people who care about humanity to stop exploiting workers who want health care instead of a war in iraq i hope your youthful energy can provide the spirit to confront the tough politics ahead

8564401 over two matches we have been the best organised team and we deserved better than to lose like that in the final minutes
8564402 we have produced a high standard in both matches and now i hope that can be continued in our league matches and the uefa cup
8564403 i sometimes wondered whether the referee was effected by the fact that we were playing a big team i felt we should have had a couple of penalties

8564408 while attention was focused on the other side of the earth a band of soldiers in mauritania led by general mohamed ould abdelaziz overthrew the government of sidi ould cheik abdallahi in a bloodless coup during the first week of august the president his family and entourage are detained and unharmed despite calls for their release by the african union the united states and the governments of the continents major powers nigeria and south africa there have been peaceful demonstrations in support of both sides of a political drama that superficially appears to be a fight for power among leaders of the countrys moorish tribes who have run mauritania since it gained independence from france in 1960
8564409 it seems too much of a coincidence that she died at the same time that we saw the spider

8564419 it gives me no pleasure to have to refer to this hotel again we were instrumental in organising a very large group action for this hotel which as can be seen resulted in a very high payout for compensation it is clear that the spanish authorities must wake up to this continuing and problematic situation it is also clear if the hotelier or the tour operators have known difficulties that they should call upon the spanish authorities or the world health organisation to assist them to resolve any problems that may exist
8564420 in the meantime i have no doubt that we shall continue to receive calls on this hotel if any holidaymaker has suffered with sickness no matter for how long it lasted they should contact us without delay

8564446 when i led the louisiana community and technical college system we looked to college of the mainland to learn from you about what youre doing with process technology
8564447 i dont really think about it much it was last year
8564448 i think youre going to see more and more parity in college football for the next five or six years than ever before and i think its here to stay
8564449 its certainly at the forefront of everybodys mind in their program that didnt do us any favors having appalachian state go in there and whack them like they did last year
8564450 i think everybody understands thats a simple thing to see
8564451 its in the past and there are lessons to be learned from the past but i dont think its really related to now any player who was here and was a part of that certainly doesnt want to be reminded of it but its out there
8564452 its not like youre playing a i aa and are worried about your guys overlooking anybody
8564453 even if i was ready to announce a starter why would i
8564454 drew banged up his thumb last thursday and the next morning i was up here it was definitely a whirlwind few days
8564455 you know you never lose hope you never doubt yourself but you hope for another opportunity to prove yourself
8564456 and you start to think about the things youd be interested in afterwards ive had some time to kind of be a regular person and explore some other things that are also interesting but you know im not done being an athlete and ill keep pursuing this yet
8564457 being in metro detroit and training camp in august it definitely brings back some memories
8564458 it seems like a long time ago in one sense and it seems like its gone by very fast
8564459 yeah certainly youre here and you get a chance to work here in the building its all about the opportunity for me its not so much the money or being on the active roster so much as getting to be here and getting to know me and seeing how i work and decide if i can help in the long term
8564460 mostly the stuff ill do is schemes ive used before
8564461 its just new terminology and new guys im working with
8564462 you dont want to put the ball on the ground you want to get in and out of the huddle make sure the substitutions are right and after that just play football i havent had a ton of practice but you dont worry about that too much you just go out there and play and be confident and leave it out there
8564463 we have to see how much he can retain right now but i just dont want to play danny second stringer dan orlovsky the whole game
8564464 i was home doing a lot of stuff wed put off working out hoping to get a call
8564465 it was surprising to get a call from the lions just because it had been a while but the opportunity heck yeah you just jump at it i was excited
8564466 for me its been a few years since i spent much time up here
8564467 its nice on many different levels to have a chance to get back
8564468 were gonna win and lose by them its not about quarterback brian hoyer me our receivers its about our offensive line
8564469 as i sat here a year ago it was a big question mark about what we were gonna be we evolved our tight end play i thought was outstanding it made a big difference in our run game
8564470 and i think people can sometimes put too much ownership on just the offensive line for the effectiveness of what youre doing we get far too much credit and it goes with the territory theres probably too much criticism when things dont go well but we welcome that and thats part of it im good with that well be all right
8564471 im not worried about our front line at all what im worried about is if we lose someone
8564472 do we have someone to step in and not miss a beat
8564473 is it fair to say i dont really worry about that because its gonna be said
8564474 its been said since ive been here so i expect it to be said when we play well we dont get no recognition for it but we do get put down if we mess up
8564475 and if we dont block for him even he could never get away
8564476 but that is the old testament it does not apply to us anymore
8564477 pardon me but i just want to know how big are your breasts
8564478 well personally im a boob man would you say youre more like a c cup or a d cup
8564479 oh have you seen the movie saving private ryan its so good its about this army officer at the battle of normandy and hes all scared right so anyway this is so cool he like throws this bomb and

8564525 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
8564526 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
8564527 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
8564528 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated
8564529 people can find the tires proper inflation level on the vehicle placard located in the driver side door jamb in the glove box or in the owners manual

8564587 these poll findings show just how many people are getting worried about losing their job in the current economic slowdown
8564588 the economy will inevitably slow this year and next given the credit crunch and the impact of higher oil food and commodity prices but there is a real danger that if everyone thinks that the downturn will be deeper than it needs to be it will become a self fulfilling prophecy

8564592 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8564593 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8564594 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be
8564595 i think this conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8564596 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8564597 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8564598 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8564599 john mccain is my friend weve known each other for three decades
8564600 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8564601 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8564602 remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as president theyll look to us again
8564603 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8564604 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8564605 will lead us away from division and fear of the last years back to unity and hope
8564606 in 2004 we came so close to victory we are even closer now and let me tell you this time were going to win
8564607 just like the past just like george bush and this country cant afford a third bush term
8564608 we cannot afford four more years like the past eight years policies that embolden our enemies undermine our economy and place unfair burden on the heroes of our armed forces
8564609 john mccain asks that we trust republicans to safeguard our national security to which we can only reply why would we
8564610 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country
8564611 lets declare with one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8564613 likewise all army soldiers were reminded that the reason for existence of the philippine army was primarily to guarantee that every filipinos rights to life speech and property are protected
8564614 as such soldiers were further reminded that they should see to it that no act should be pursued if this will mean an infringement of the rights of any individual which they as soldiers have sworn to protect
8564615 however soldiers are reminded that they should take these negative criticisms as a challenge to do better soldiers were told that their deeds in pursuit of their observance of human rights will be greater than the words we use to refute these false allegations
8564616 i have a sword but i have chosen not to use it
8564617 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8564618 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8564619 thus in this case considering that a previous inhibition had been filed against justice ong with the approval of the undersigned and considering further that an administrative matter regarding his citizenship is pending inquiry it is paramount that justice ong be free from any appearance of bias against or hostility toward the undersigned
8564620 the continued appearance of the undersigned before the honorable chair ong would be inconsistent with his query before the supreme court regarding the incumbency status of honorable gregory s on as associate justice of the sandiganbayan

8564626 i thought it was very important at this stage to say to friendly countries like the ukraine that we were determined to support their democratic choices
8564627 the point i want to underline above all others is that whats happened since the collapse of the soviet union is not a western plot
8564628 its a series of decisions by independent sovereign democracies about the course that they want to take not a course of confrontation with russia but a course of engagement with the west which i think is wholly within their rights and is something weve been right to support
8564629 we dont accept that the choice for ukraine is that either you are an enemy of russia or you are a vassal of russia you can be a partner of the west you can be a partner of russia
8564630 its right to talk about an international crisis theres no question of launching an all out war against russia
8564631 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8564632 the last 15 or so years have seen a period in which europes borders have been clearly demarcated new nations have come out of the old soviet union theyve joined the european union
8564633 and the european countries have enjoyed a period of unprecedented stability i think that the danger that arises from russian actions is that that period comes to an end
8564634 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action of our fellow g8 member
8564635 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8564636 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe

8564661 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8564662 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8564663 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8564664 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8564665 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8564666 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8564667 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8564687 the conversation between the individual and the officers was laced with obscenities
8564688 but the west ignoring the delicacy of the situation unwittingly or wittingly fed the hopes of the south ossetians and abkhazians for freedom they clasped to their bosom a georgian president mikheil saakashvili whose first move was to crush the autonomy of another region adjaria and made no secret of his intention to squash the ossetians and abkhazians

8564698 meskipun aborsi dianggap sebagai tindakan kriminal namun kenyataannya sekitar dua juta perempuan indonesia melakukan aborsi setiap tahunnya dan kebanyakan dilakukan secara tidak aman atau tidak dilakukan oleh tenaga kesehatan terampil di fasilitas pelayanan yang memadai
8564699 misalnya saja dalam pasal 15 ayat 1 undang undang kesehatan disebutkan bahwa dalam keadaan darurat sebagai upaya untuk menyelamatkan jiwa ibu hamil dan atau janinnya dapat dilakukan tindakan medis tertentu dan apa yang dimaksud dengan tindakan medis tertentu ini tidak dijelaskan
8564700 aturan yang dimaksudkan di sini tidak menggunakan pendekatan pelarangan tetapi pengaturan dan upaya pencegahan atas praktik aborsi yang tidak aman
8564701 untuk memenuhi hak reproduksi perempuan negara juga wajib menyediakan fasilitas layanan aborsi aman yang bermutu dan mudah dijangkau oleh perempuan yang membutuhkan
8564702 tapi ini adalah masalah peka dan masih menjadi kontroversi dalam masyarakat belum semua kelompok masyarakat menyetujuinya undang undang juga belum memungkinkan dilakukannya penyediaan layanan aborsi yang aman

8564707 bagi yang tidak tahu kita mencoba memberitahukan dengan pelatihan ini sedang bagi yang sudah tahu namun tetap melakukan tindakan itu kita jelaskan bahwa langkah itu tidak benar
8564708 namun kegiatan ini bukan untuk menciptakan langkah langkah baru dalam menghindari penyidikan kasus korupsi atau membenarkan sebuah tindakan yang ternyata adalah korupsi secara bersama sama

8564711 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well
8564712 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8564713 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth
8564714 we must ensure that the market does not shrink as a result of price hikes therefore we have decided to limit the number of models that would be affected
8564715 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented

8564727 it was an all girl drum and bugle corps that actually started in butler in 1940
8564728 she only took this position because of us and because of her great organizational skills and its funny because many of the instructors she hired for us have gone on to become big names in the drum and bugle corps scene
8564729 she would never let six weeks go by without seeing them no matter where we were at the time
8564730 that was the neighborhood where mom grew up and lived for many many years and they have all kept in touch

8564735 this is uncharted territory there are a lot of creative ways to aggressively go after a creditor if you are a creditor you have to ask whether its best to play ball with ken lewis or play tough
8564736 it brings everybody out in the open theyll only have 90 days after the announcement to file any more claims
8564737 it makes sense for b of a to make countrywide detachable so that its legal problems do not affect the entire enterprise
8564738 the threat of bankruptcy might give b of a some leverage in negotiating with the plaintiffs attorneys but the threat is a bit of a bluff unless bank of america is willing to lose control of countrywide
8564739 plaintiffs lawyers definitely wouldnt want to have to deal with bankruptcy and companies have sometimes used bankruptcy strategically to deal with litigation

8564751 all these hours just to be a volunteer becomes an issue when you get out of school and you have other interests and other priorities like a family and a job
8564752 i cant say enough about highlands high school for having the courage and the foresight to get involved in this its tremendous
8564753 its an incentive to save some money when they go on to college

8564760 an innovative program to prevent and treat child abuse which is the mission of family resources
8564761 when we see a child having a meltdown or a child standing dangerously in a shopping cart we dont know what to do
8564762 we are all kind of helpless and freeze when we see others in this situation what we want to do is enable people to assist these parents
8564763 the video showed how people could assist parents with their children through gentle intervention
8564764 i came aboard the project in the fall of 2002 when my boys were almost 3 and 5
8564765 we knew it was a great concept but we asked ourselves how can we get everyday people to understand and use this concept
8564766 lets just say that my younger son has always been an intense and loud child i was living it
8564767 i never got to meet him and i wanted to know his thoughts and plans for the program
8564768 what is the first thing you see on the show
8564769 we want people to stop and recognize when they may be able to help a parent or child take a moment to pause think and get ready to assist and three try one kind word to assist
8564770 getting involved may be as simple as standing closer to a shopping cart where a child is standing and in a dangerous situation while the parent is busy with another child
8564771 that was a lot of fun we filmed the video at the giant eagle in the waterworks from midnight to 6 a m here we are filming a video about child abuse and we had children there in the middle of the night
8564772 we had to get all sorts of waivers and special permission to make it
8564773 based on our feedback we can say that we can really impact how people can help parents in difficult situations
8564774 we want it to be a regional showpiece we want to put the message out in our region that one kind word can make a difference to someone
8564775 we have been talking with a major grocery store chain and other places such as museums and amusement parks we feel that anywhere large groups of families with children gather will be the ideal sites for the program
8564776 smart phones are going to be the device du jour featured at all carriers for the rest of the year
8564777 the idea of the environment isnt something thats only in science it has a direct connection with social studies
8564778 were teaching kids about science and in a lot of our discussion today in current affairs and current trends were trying to be more energy efficient
8564779 its just kind of a way of life now and to promote that with our kids is important

8564787 public safety is the key element of our management protocols
8564788 a basic premise of our approach is that individuals or their cases are not discussed in public

8564794 simpel omdat er niets was we hebben de site gelanceerd toen de moederwebsite isidorusweb zeven jaar bestond die portal voor surfende katholieken is toegewijd aan isidorus van sevilla de patroonheilige van het internet dat jubileum verdiende een traktatie voor onze bezoekers is uniek in uitwerking en het heeft een jonge uitstraling isidorusweb is een soort unilever voor katholieken we bieden meerdere sites achtergronden en opinie op isidorusweb nl de moedersite je kunt relishoppen op rkwinkel nl je kunt een geloofscursus volgen op geloofskwesties nl en je kunt nu real time nieuws en blogs bijhouden op katholieknieuws nl
8564795 je hebt nieuwssites als katholiek nieuwsblad of rorate zij werken met een eigen redactieformat en eigen windwijzer katholieknieuws nl selecteert de bronnen maar die worden vervolgens onverkort en onafhankelijk gepresenteerd dit brengt meer variatie in nieuwsaanbod en meer democratisering in het katholieke internetlandschap zeker als je de bloggers meetelt

8564797 is nog een beetje vroeg want we zijn net online wij mikken op zon 3 000 bezoekers per dag binnen n jaar en dat is op weekbasis drie keer zo veel als de oplage van het katholiek nieuwsblad zeg maar de marktleider omdat isidorusweb al aan dat aantal zit moet dat voor deze doelgroep te realiseren zijn zeer acceptabel in dit medialandschap
8564798 we maken de site met zijn twee n maarten blokdijk en mijzelf eric van den berg samen zoeken we continu naar innovaties zoals rkwinkel nl en cms ontwikkeld en doet de techniek hij bouwt sinds 1999 op eigen initiatief of voor klanten webapplicaties zoals uitgebreide webshops e learning omgevingen en web 2 0 sites ik ben teamleider bij de koninklijke bibliotheek ik werk onder andere aan optimalisatie van processtromen het duurzaam archiveren van websites en het verwerken en duurzaam opslaan van digitale publicaties voor het nageslacht verder ben ik eigenaar en man with the plan achter isidorusweb mijn vrijwilligersinitiatief

8564803 wise is the tongue wet of perfect thought and softest neck where always do i lay my clumsy thoughts
8564804 that billboard prose shining on me and it shines because its been so long since my telstar i hope it crashes in the sea
8564805 my heart is crammed in my cranium and it still knows how to pound
8564806 steeples dont hurt any more than they used to hurt
8564807 impenitent brothers sway to the song of a new heretical dawn
8564808 maybe i know where to run brother i know where to hide
8564809 i am a tastemaker and i kill things i am not a tastemaker and i kill things
8564810 and jennifer your haltertop a consecrated altar but ive run my hands and knees in shame there one too many times
8564811 outlandish schemes for the andover dreams weve weaned ourselves off of and off of and off of
8564812 i just finished the book and some of its true
8564813 i thought ibm was born with the world the u s flag would float forever the cold opponent did pack away the capital will have to follow its not eternal imperishable oh yes it will go
8564814 i am the trick my mother played on the world
8564815 before i go i gotta ask you dear about the tan line on your ring finger
8564816 youll never fail like common people and watch your life slide out of view
8564817 a actual ministra da sa de parece ser uma honesta defensora do servi o nacional de sa de ter poder os sinais n o s o animadores
8564818 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8564819 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8564820 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8564821 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8564822 she is who i see when i look at you ive watched you paint your life on this canvas i watched every stroke you made i cried every tear you cried and more i waited i waited and wanted more than life itself to come to you but i couldnt you never called out to me until now i had to be sure you wanted me
8564823 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8564824 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8564825 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8564826 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8564827 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8564828 he has little regard for the well being of his neighbors or anyone else in the greater community
8564829 this is serious he will do whatever he wants to do
8564830 i cant believe he could do this and get arrested and be out the next day
8564831 if kens kids had been outside mr hunker would have killed them
8564832 he drove right by and i said there he goes
8564833 i asked if he had been drinking and he stated yes he drank a pint of vodka
8564834 hunker could not perform field sobriety tests safely at the scene and was placed under arrest for dui
8564835 his continued driving and a lack of any kind of apology suggests a frank disregard for the safety and consideration of everyone around him
8564836 anyone should contact state police or hampton falls police who has had contact with mr currier through most likely internet services
8564837 i saw it when i was sitting down after i was hit
8564838 there were two girls and a guy i was talking to him i said you hit me call the police he said give me your watch i passed out i woke up by the time i got home it was 3 30 a m i called my mom the ambulance and state police showed up
8564839 i woke up sitting in front of the pink store seacoast bargains inc i was in shock i was out of it
8564840 weve been in this building for more than 15 years
8564841 the landlord has been great to us but we have grown thats not necessarily a good thing but its fact we would like a place where we are more inviting and have quiet spaces to offer our clients
8564842 our business is to go out of business but thats not happening
8564843 we need to do more education we need people to know how it affects the family as a whole we need less tolerance for domestic violence
8564844 no because shes so fat and she always feels the need to be in her underwear
8564845 isnt she pregnant again you just reach a point where thats just not ok
8564846 sure why not she needs something to boost her career
8564847 he did get cash and checks we are going to ask the ones who issued checks to call their bank and ask to put a stop on the check
8564848 each time he went to a house he had a different explanation as to something associated with the boston hospital
8564849 when the victims were talking and questioning him he would respond with an answer for their questions it was like he was making it up as he went along
8564850 the response has been overwhelming we expect it will be standing room only and hope we dont have to turn anyone away
8564851 we really are at an amazing point in our political history
8564852 i think this is just really the time for change
8564853 he obama is being encouraged to be more partisan because many democrats are afraid of him being swift boated
8564854 if he gives a soaring speech he will be hit for not focusing on blue collar democrats who supported clinton hes boxed in
8564855 if you look at his policies they are all extremely specific
8564856 obamas speech will give us the energy and the message we need to leave here primed for the general election
8564857 its limited at best at this point because the charging officer has not had a chance to finalize the report
8564858 as i understand it the board does not have standing to remove her from her position so we are not looking at that as an option
8564859 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8564860 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8564861 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8564862 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8564863 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8564864 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8564865 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8564866 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8564867 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8564868 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8564869 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8564870 we have contacted town attorney pat scully to assess things and see if there were any valid concerns
8564871 the preliminary assessment by pat was that we were ok but thats not good enough for me
8564872 the only way is to have an unbiased group look at this
8564873 the budget review committee will be supplemented with an accountant and financial analyst
8564874 theyll calculate the last 10 years of expenses from the parking lots and also project out the next 10 years to see what all the expenses are
8564875 maines stunning coastline attracts tourists from around the world every summer boosting the local economy and creating summer jobs for thousands of mainers
8564876 yet the viability of the maines beaches depends on the health of the coastline and the protection of its ecosystems maines healthy beaches program keeps our beloved coastline clean and healthy and maines beach visitors safe and happy
8564877 our fudge candy and ice cream and i make all my own fudge
8564878 because of the quality of the fudge i have and the candy and ice cream also for the friendliness of the store
8564879 the people we have longtime customers who come back year after year
8564880 our limited edition apparel and our wide variety of sunglasses only small shops get the apparel we have
8564881 to get the lowest prices around on limited edition apparel and sunglasses
8564882 the best prices on the coast of maine 5 t shirts and 15 hoodies
8564883 no need for them because we sell by volume and have a shallow markup
8564884 encouraging the formation of interstate school districts which will each be a natural social and economic region with adequate financial resources and a number of pupils sufficient to permit the efficient use of school facilities within the interstate district and to provide improved instruction
8564885 i think it would be great for my tenants and it would ease traffic flow and hang ups on route 1
8564886 we are currently in discussions with the pet store owner to resolve any potential conflict
8564887 i wanted to construct a building and parking area that was aesthetically pleasing that would fit in with the atmosphere here and wasnt an eyesore to the community
8564888 we dont have enough money to pay the rent to pay the electric to pay the phone
8564889 the challenge is prices are rising around us but paychecks are the same
8564890 our agencies are telling us theyre seeing a good 30 to 40 percent increase in individuals that theyre serving food to
8564891 im seeing families having to make choices between food and fuel or clothing for their children
8564892 theyre working minimum wage minimum hour jobs with no health care no benefits theyre one illness away from bankruptcy
8564893 the captain announced on the public address system that wed be the first warship to enter following three mine sweepers we dropped anchor at 1 10 p m i could see yokosuka up the bay their big naval base
8564894 we were doing scattered mopping up operations then we went up past guam it was quiet there and then to saipan and okinawa we didnt do a lot of fighting mostly cleaning up
8564895 there were no medical facilities on shore we provided emergency care mostly to our soldiers but also to the japanese we were told not to discriminate
8564896 i would go into their homes in tokyo and yokohama
8564897 any place you went the kids would surround you i found the people to be so nice they had given us a little booklet of common japanese sayings but i didnt really get japanese and they didnt really understand english but you figure out how to communicate
8564898 the filling originally started around 1986 here it is 20 years later and its still going on
8564899 the many many trucks coming and going are a danger to the town
8564900 they keep tracking clay and other materials out onto goodwin road
8564901 if youre up there and watch a truck being unloaded youll see a cloud of dust that comes up
8564902 we are concerned about the possibility that unacceptable debris is getting inadvertently or maliciously mixed in with the fill in a way thats difficult to detect and could end up poisoning the ground and groundwater
8564903 i dont have a lot of concern about material itself in terms of health or environmental hazards it might pose
8564904 there has been a lot of confusion about the issue and im hoping to clear some of this up
8564905 i was deeply honored to be recognized and it has taken a lot of extra time and effort and i will continue to do it
8564906 sharon has led the charge in many cases and asked that the reliability continue to be considered and what cost it will have on the consumer
8564907 she has been instrumental in helping draft and write legislation that will benefit the consumer
8564908 its an incredibly time consuming and demanding task she is someone who is dedicated to rolling up their sleeves and seeing that things get done
8564909 i just wish theyd finish it up but i know it is all part of progress
8564910 i guess its been about two weeks of pure dust
8564911 this hasnt been an easy job because of the weather
8564912 the weather has not done us any favors we seem to be just getting out of it toward the end of the project
8564913 there are a lot of things that have been put on top of the sewer or have crossed it over time
8564914 when you get into the dirt its really what matters
8564915 we expect to get at least this 80 year length of life out of the new pvc
8564916 at the end of the day its our decision well be actively participating but have experts that guide the process
8564917 i really want to cast a wide net on this one
8564918 weve been a good risk and the pool had money left over so it returned some to the town
8564919 weve tried to keep up with risk management training and other mma training and we try not to have accidents
8564920 the property and casualty policy also has a clause to cover any litigation against the town and public officials liability
8564921 i have knocked on 600 doors in town so far
8564922 my goal is to hit between 1 500 and 2 000
8564923 the second year was a whole different feeling you quickly realize that people are gearing up to run again so the desire to work together isnt as great people were paying more attention to how a vote will look
8564924 going through tax reform was a tough thing to do
8564925 no matter how good the package might have been if we couldnt get an agreement from the democrats that any future increases needed a two thirds vote of the legislature we couldnt agree to support it thats what happened
8564926 a reduction in spending is the other half of the equation
8564927 we need tax reform but we also must reduce the increase in spending it has to go hand in hand or it wont work
8564928 i think were getting close one of my biggest disappointments was the passage of the tax to support dirigo i truly believe thats money raised on the backs of maine people and spent on a program thats a failure we need to cover these people but we need to do it by opening up the free market to insurers by eliminating the guaranteed coverage for all mandate we came very close to passing that in the last term
8564929 we knew it was there almost every building of that age has something in it
8564930 the removal has taken a little longer than they thought but i dont know of a construction project that hasnt had some delays
8564931 i got a letter from the commissioner aug 11 strongly encouraging us to consider forming a regional school unit rsu or an alternative organizational structure aos with kittery
8564932 she said neither wells nor kittery is an approved configuration
8564933 in kitterys case they cannot be approved as they are because of the way the law is written
8564934 they have fewer than 1 200 students in the case of wells they have over 1 200 students but fewer then 2 500 the commissioner was not sufficiently convinced theyd be able to sustain the educational component
8564935 theyd probably keep separate school bus depots because of the distance but there are other areas
8564936 look at the administrative staff could you share a business office were not really talking about teaching staff but administrative functions payroll is a great example
8564937 they started to get together immediately as a result they had a plan that got approved in june they created a system theyre proud of
8564938 this was a dream from the beginning of when we opened the museum
8564939 we formed a dory committee and hired boat builder bob eger who has a shop in south berwick we had a lot of volunteers that went there to help him build it
8564940 the volunteers are getting the inside ready and then will flip it and do the exterior
8564941 it will be deep green on the bottom with two yellow stripes on top those were the traditional colors
8564942 he had his shop in the place behind where the camera shop on shore road is
8564943 he launched the boats at the end of wharf lane there were a lot of wharfs there originally
8564944 she designed it from pictures there was no plan of a dory anywhere but plenty of pictures
8564945 i feel my 14th amendment rights of due process are denied if the supreme judicial courts ruling on how signatures are to be gathered is accepted and allowed to be applied retroactively
8564946 the standard the court used and said should be applied was not known to anyone when the signatures were gathered
8564947 dw currently represents msad 71 the arundel school department and the town of kennebunkport these established relationships could cast doubt albeit perhaps unfounded as to whether dw would act on behalf of kennebunk with unquestioned impartiality
8564948 that law firm is looking out for the interests of those entities and the rsu planning committee which could be a potential conflict
8564949 by not going with drummond woodsum you can avoid that question mark altogether
8564950 if at some point in the process it appeared that the clients had a conflict the clients would have to resolve that dispute or negation point on their own
8564951 its too small a change in too small a place
8564952 is the population of portsmouth going to grow in the next several years not that i can see
8564953 theres nothing in the background data to suggest future growth
8564954 the parking lot of which is a regular meeting place for narcotic transactions according to trooper tirella

8564963 france is definitely the good place to be when working around open source
8564964 the french social model was appropriate for innovators and entrepreneurs to start working on alternative solutions to proprietary software fostering the creation of new projects in which a good mix of experienced professionals and skilled computer science students work together
8564965 in the u s open source projects tend to be narrow and only for leading edge organizations whereas in europe theyre mainstream
8564966 european organizations have a business opportunity to combine multiple open source point projects into solutions for virtual private networks soa enablement business intelligence

8564968 on a daily basis more and more consumers are discovering our unique quality and value proposition and recent initiatives such as our one in every 15 prices reduced campaign and 25 off non food sale are generating tangible sales increases
8564969 that they d planned to do anyway as part of the future transition to google app engine

8564979 the attention they did get tended to be more negative than that of democrats and in some specific media genres the difference is particularly striking

8565006 the same folks who call themselves compassionate conservatives are the folks who abandoned all those people not only after katrina but before that storm
8565007 but democrats dont deserve to win just because republicans deserve to lose if the american story is to have a chance we need more than better programs and policies we need a better vision

8565029 maar ik werd wel eerst door freud getest om te zien of ik zuiver was
8565030 ik antwoordde dat in een goed portret iets zit van de persoon zelf maar dat er ook iets in moet zitten wat je niet te zien krijgt ook heb ik richard avedon geciteerd deze fotograaf zei ooit alle fotos zijn nauwkeurig maar geen enkele toont de waarheid
8565031 ik heb hem geportretteerd naast het graf van pluto zijn overleden hond
8565032 toen hij dat zag pakte een schilderskwast en gaf die aan mij dat vond ik een geweldig gebaar
8565033 effects of external qigong therapy on osteoarthritis of the knee
8565034 although further research needs to be conducted qigong may be an effective complementary treatment for osteoarthritis
8565035 given the limitation and potential adverse effects of drug intervention of osteoarthritis qigong therapy might prove to be a valuable option as a supplement to conventional treatment
8565036 above all the letters and emails we receive every day from listeners all over the world really make the effort worth it because its clear that our programmes are helping to enthuse young people about science which is incredibly satisfying to see and exactly what we set out to do im also proud to work with a terrific team of people without whom none of this would be possible
8565037 when podcasting really took off we were almost swept away by the tide of traffic that came our way i blew up a couple of web servers and was even ejected by a number of web hosting companies for compromising their networks every time we published a show
8565038 chris smith is a beacon for science communication he has been awarded the royal society kohn award for his pioneering approach to making complex material accessible to a non scientific audience we hope that this award will enable him to continue his fantastic work and develop even more exciting parts of the naked scientists radio show
8565039 i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression

8565041 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8565042 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8565043 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8565044 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8565045 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8565046 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8565047 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8565048 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8565049 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8565052 it seems too much of a coincidence that she died at the same time that we saw the spider
8565053 if it is the spider they believe it is then normally they dont attack humans but could give a painful bite
8565054 the disappointing thing for us is that gerrard will have to have a groin operation in the morning
8565055 he will be out for around 10 to 15 days he needs to have the operation because he has been in a lot of pain we knew he had this problem before he went on international duty with england last week for the friendly against the czech republic but yesterday i spoke with the club doctor and with steven and he agreed he needed the operation
8565056 it is not a serious injury ten to 15 days is not long but he needs it
8565057 i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8565058 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8565059 cast will be determined by sony pictures based on who is willing to come back after we finish the script
8565060 if experience cannot be fulfilled sony pictures will provide alternative set visits premieres based on the providers availability
8565061 thats my nature our defensive staff was talking about that thats our nature and we are going to prepare as hard for this game as any game we play
8565062 really the first game is always the toughest because youre not sure where youre at and youve been going against your own offense in camp i think there is a little bit of uncertainty because youre not sure how good you are so the first game always creates a little bit of uncertainty
8565063 i dont know his brother at all but our coach heacock obviously won the frank broyles award last year for the best assistant coach in the nation and he was truly deserving
8565064 he does all the little things and he really wants our defense as a whole to be great he has a passion for it
8565065 anybody can beat you on any day we all know that from last year
8565066 if you take anybody the least bit lightly its going to be a long day
8565067 beanie wells had 16 carries for 46 yards for whatever reason
8565068 my brother felt like he could compete with anybody on any level
8565069 hes a fierce competitor i dont think hell be intimidated walking into that stadium hes been there before and he watched his brother dominate ohio state
8565070 when i talked about ohio state i usually backed it up
8565071 but i had other guys help me back up what i said we had a way of intimidating ohio state on and off the field im not sure youngstown can do the same
8565072 i cant say anything crazy hes the all star im in the shadows
8565073 when i got out on the field last year i was like wow this is my time to play ohio state
8565074 im not going to lie i had pregame jitters but once that first contact got out of the way it was hey lets go play ball
8565075 i really believe the big ten conference is strong as ever
8565076 the big ten has always been hated by the sec and the pac 10 but its never been a punch line
8565077 and right now not by me but from what i hear from other regions they mock the big ten they laugh at the big ten they think the big ten is the most overrated overhyped conference in the country every year
8565078 they just destroy me no matter where i go its like big ten is right on my forehead ive been on the show 13 years and its never been like that the last two years thats all it is
8565079 i think the big ten has lost a lot of respect the past couple years
8565080 you got a feel for it going to the awards dinners that maybe the big ten isnt looked on as maybe it was in the past
8565081 any time you talk to guys in the big ten you get a feel for it whether its the players or the medias attitude toward you it seems every big ten team is overrated and the players are overrated
8565082 my take on that is that its not a slow conference
8565083 its just that the speed is at different positions in the sec in the sec you have the speed more in the trenches everyone has fast dbs but in the sec we have fast linebackers defensive linemen and offensive linemen
8565084 it makes the game go so much faster because so much stuff can happen in the trenches like that
8565085 certain teams in the big ten might have one defensive end or linebacker thats fast in the sec youll have an eight defensive linemen rotation where all of them are around the same speed and are strong
8565086 from the fans perspective they feel the big ten is big slow and not as quick as we are in the sec
8565087 those guys play football just as well as we do theyre big strong fast guys that stereotype might have been true years ago but right now the playing field is pretty level
8565088 when youre used to playing in weather like those guys are it plays to their advantage you have to build a team thats able to run the ball and thats what they do
8565089 ohio state has gone to two national championship games and gotten beat so everybody says its a reflection of the whole league
8565090 i dont think thats necessarily true those games are six to seven weeks after the regular season youre talking about totally different situations and circumstances that teams go through
8565091 i think theres good football in the big ten ive not marked off any of those schools to go scout joe thomas and braylon edwards two of our best players came out of those schools im not going to sit here and slap the big ten around
8565092 were going to put underclassmen in their place and let them know were here for one reason and one reason only
8565093 were not letting them get away with anything if you see somebody slacking we tell them to quit because we have one goal in mind and thats a national championship and were not going to get it if youre slacking
8565094 theyve been excited about everything weve done they really have
8565095 meetings have been attentive this senior group theyre really an active group as far as leadership and it shows
8565096 if youre a young guy you better come along because the reality is you dont have time to pull the guys along
8565097 the guys that are ready to play they can play the guys that arent they cant play and thats just the reality of it
8565098 were very conscious that theres a bunch of guys that could have gone on and theyre excited about being here another year so weve got to make sure they get our best
8565099 it was a great reminder to us that theyve risked a little bit if you will and weve got to make sure that we do everything we can do to make their risk pay off
8565100 i see some of the younger guys particularly the draft pick players really progressing well
8565101 the really disappointing thing was the overall effort in the game
8565102 they just werent flying around to the football like they had been all through camp i dont know what the reason for that was but that was disappointing
8565103 so really thats what im looking for this weekend and like i told them the other day i want to find out when we get punched a few times who wants to punch back we got punched a few times the other night who wants to take it and who wants to get up and give us something
8565104 we counted on some guys who werent able to do much in the preseason and we counted on them for the regular season and they didnt necessarily come through with flying colors
8565105 i think thats important where we are this year as a team
8565106 if you enter the season a little beat up and injured it can take a toll on you as you go down the road now sometimes you may have no choice
8565107 i wish he wouldve been able to play some more last week
8565108 but he wasnt able to and hopefully this week hell be able to show us that hes ready go
8565109 i see some of the younger guys particularly the draft pick players really progressing well
8565110 the really disappointing thing was the overall effort in the game
8565111 they just werent flying around to the football like they had been all through camp i dont know what the reason for that was but that was disappointing
8565112 so really thats what im looking for this weekend and like i told them the other day i want to find out when we get punched a few times who wants to punch back we got punched a few times the other night who wants to take it and who wants to get up and give us something
8565113 we counted on some guys who werent able to do much in the preseason and we counted on them for the regular season and they didnt necessarily come through with flying colors
8565114 i think thats important where we are this year as a team
8565115 if you enter the season a little beat up and injured it can take a toll on you as you go down the road now sometimes you may have no choice
8565116 gt b gt obama speech could bump tonights bengals game
8565117 because of the long history and tradition we have for news here and the historic nature of the convention we thought our wkrc tv viewers would expect to see the convention on local 12
8565118 the nfl thats a job and the money is nice but even though we work hard at football here we also have a lot of fun at it too
8565119 and theres something about your senior season that seemed too good to pass up
8565120 i think everyone came back for their own reasons but we all love being here and being part of the history and the tradition at ohio state
8565121 there is a sense of unfinished business but i dont think were here just because of the way the last game turned out we wantto play together one more time try and win em all and see what happens
8565122 weve got some weapons a lot of real talent on the offensive side
8565123 i look around the huddle and see a bunch of playmakers
8565124 looking at what we have back its not surprising that the expectations are real high
8565125 but thats not unusual were used to that around here im excited to see what we can accomplish
8565126 theres a lot of pride in this defense and its not guys worrying about their own numbers and things like that
8565127 we thrive as a unit theres a real sense of brotherhood of fighting for each other on every play
8565128 we do have a fierce sense of urgency because weve got an older group and all of us want to make sure this season is a great one for those 27 seniors
8565129 this is the last time that they get to experience that horseshoe so i think your urgency is demonstrated in your performance but so far ive seen good urgency
8565130 the other thing is id like for us to look decent it seems that the consensus is that we were decent in the jets game even though we lost that one id like to look decent against the bears and go from there
8565131 if you have a team that needs to develop a winning attitude then its really important that you win
8565132 it varies by team and were somewhere in the middle weve got young quarterbacks corners so id say were a young team were also young as far as winning goes because we havent done a whole lot of it around here
8565133 hopefully it will be a more consistent step than we saw in detroit but each game is different im sure the bears will put some pressure on him to see if we can handle it better than we did last week
8565134 i just want to be more consistent put more points on the board and really show much better execution on my part
8565135 i want to manage the game move the chains and do things in an efficient fashion
8565136 it was my first time last week experiencing it and its tough
8565137 im glad we get a chance to practice it now because weve really got to bust it and get things into gear and get on the same page i think the whole team has a heightened sense of urgency
8565138 we see the slowdown in the u s market as a fundamental change
8565139 theyve been trying to get me out of here for a long time now
8565140 thats the thing i think i told you guys when we first started last year we counted on some guys who werent able to do much in the preseason and they didnt necessarily come through with flying colors i think its important where we are this year as a team particularly that we do see guys play in the preseason and have a feel for that
8565141 he catches the ball well he can run after the catch he has a true burst
8565142 he has to come in and show that hes a better ballplayer better ball carrier and everything else that we ask that position to do than chris
8565143 and that he can withstand what it takes to do it
8565144 just move on no big deal its part of the game part of the business

8565154 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8565155 on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama has been proven right
8565156 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8565157 it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8565158 will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope
8565159 change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things
8565160 everybody who wants to can come i think we will have a great night i look forward to seeing you there
8565161 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8565162 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8565163 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8565164 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8565165 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8565166 i dont know how i can live now because none of my family is left
8565167 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8565168 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8565169 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8565170 its well known who helped georgian authorities and even encouraged them in pursuit of their own aims this is unacceptable and must end
8565171 there are also questions of socio economic cooperation particularly in the sectors of energy transport trade finance information technologies and agriculture on the agenda
8565172 when a tree falls in a forest obama hears it
8565173 you ruined my life america now i will destroy your world
8565174 its a package that doesnt require the support of the opposition and doesnt require legislation
8565175 this is the consequence of what mr ofarrell has done today and the government will respond
8565176 we have a duty and an obligation to the people of new south wales to maintain the states energy supplies and its financial security
8565177 yesterday we had no plan b today we have a plan b
8565178 this was always their plan b a plan b that yesterday he said didnt exist
8565179 i just dont think he can be trusted on any of this and i think thats what the community made up their mind on some time ago
8565180 what we are seeing is morris iemma and michael costa treat the parliament and the people of new south wales with the same contempt with which they have treated their own party
8565181 hes completely misled parliament he misled the people of new south wales
8565182 actually it was normal diplomatic dialogue no criticism no protests and it was conveyed in a very constructive way we actually exchanged our opinions on the situation
8565183 we are not interested in any confrontation with the west we are open for all sorts of dialogue and we are ready for the dialogue
8565184 if nato opts for scaling down cooperation with us in many aspects then we will respond in the same way
8565185 but for the time being our reply was rather pragmatic we said that a lot of military activities will be suspended
8565186 to my knowledge this is the highest price for any slice of the cake sold at auction
8565187 all our crews are educated to economise on fuel and in terms of training 20 knots is fast enough
8565188 the severn class all weather boats use about 540 litres of fuel per hour at 24 knots and this should drop to less than 500 litres at 20 knots
8565189 the question is how do you measure performance of schools or for that matter the quality of teaching performance of teachers
8565190 were going to spend every day looking for every opportunity to remind voters in the twin cities and across the country that a vote for john mccain is a vote for george w bush and his failed policies

8565193 it was an all girl drum and bugle corps that actually started in butler in 1940
8565194 she only took this position because of us and because of her great organizational skills and its funny because many of the instructors she hired for us have gone on to become big names in the drum and bugle corps scene
8565195 she would never let six weeks go by without seeing them no matter where we were at the time
8565196 that was the neighborhood where mom grew up and lived for many many years and they have all kept in touch
8565197 she sent quite a few of those out to a lot of people
8565198 all these hours just to be a volunteer becomes an issue when you get out of school and you have other interests and other priorities like a family and a job
8565199 i cant say enough about highlands high school for having the courage and the foresight to get involved in this its tremendous
8565200 its an incentive to save some money when they go on to college
8565201 if you are trained and volunteer to serve theyll give you free board at the college
8565202 were challenging the community to get involved if the community meets the challenge then were going to give the alliance 25 000 to use for firefighter scholarships
8565203 any young firefighter trainee who goes through the school program and graduates will be eligible
8565204 if 500 people come and attend any of those community safety sessions then they will have met their goal
8565205 when the whistle blows you expect someone to show up its getting to the point that especially during the day its just not going to happen
8565206 after 9 11 boy we thought wed have all these people wanting to be firemen to be heroes but it didnt happen
8565207 the idea of the environment isnt something thats only in science it has a direct connection with social studies
8565208 were teaching kids about science and in a lot of our discussion today in current affairs and current trends were trying to be more energy efficient
8565209 its just kind of a way of life now and to promote that with our kids is important
8565210 if they do approach you say yes without having to come back to the board
8565211 walking up the hill it was like everybody was reaching out a hand wanting to touch you wanting you to touch them wanting to talk to you wanting to have you acknowledge them
8565212 as we came over the hill the crowd kind of erupted in cheering
8565213 i asked our interpreter about it and he said they just want to come see the american doctor and have the american doctor tell them theyre ok
8565214 we sent him to the ship to have his colostomy reversed it changed his life without the surgery he would have had a colostomy for the rest of his life
8565215 those are cases where you just dont know what to say
8565216 they leave and in the back of your mind you know theyre going to die
8565217 being in military life you learn to do as much as you can for as many as you can
8565218 coming from a small community a lot of times you dont know what else is out there
8565219 its really any opportunity to talk about the fact that this stuff is happening
8565220 people think were here to kill and destroy that were out here just to fight wars
8565221 but were really out here to prevent wars and to help people who need it
8565222 my idea of italian cuisine was franco american in a can
8565223 i dont know if the generation coming up will keep it going
8565224 more of them are couples where they are both professionals and they also have family here
8565225 there were the beaver dams and the monkey vines and fossil rock
8565226 wed have to clean them up to get them ready for bed
8565227 i think every boy in the neighborhood worked for him at one time or another
8565228 i tell my friends about it and there are other neighborhood groups but no one has a neighborhood like this
8565229 it was just a really really tight family kind of thing
8565230 that was a specific personal item of my great grandfather
8565231 i think its very unique for a church to have a room with so many historical items
8565232 i want people to know its here we have a room full of history
8565233 my dream is to have children laughing and playing on the hillside down behind us
8565234 not just to design a building but work with our client to design a community
8565235 we still dont want it and we are not happy about it
8565236 some of our early efforts to inform neighbors were disrupted
8565237 neighbors may be invited in small groups up to hearth offices to talk about where we are and where we are going
8565238 the idea of the environment isnt something thats only in science it has a direct connection with social studies
8565239 were teaching kids about science and in a lot of our discussion today in current affairs and current trends were trying to be more energy efficient
8565240 its just kind of a way of life now and to promote that with our kids is important
8565241 juventus are obviously a much bigger club both in italy and worldwide so hopefully it will be a step up
8565242 we will probably be dominating more games compared to aston villa in england so it will be different in that sense
8565243 obviously there are differences in the style of football overall but its all been good so far
8565244 weve had quite a lot of tough games in pre season which has been good weve done well overall and had a good start in the champions league as well
8565245 the events are sure to be spectacular for this special occasion
8565246 this year well have a food court featuring a pig roast and oven baked chicken among many other foods and well also have 25th anniversary shirts available for purchase
8565247 preparing shovel ready land is the key to jump starting development stimulating job growth and attracting new businesses within the airport corridor and the surrounding area
8565248 thats when you know youve hit the jackpot as far as economic development
8565249 they led the way in the marketplace they said we believe in this and we think it will work that was a huge step

8565260 an innovative program to prevent and treat child abuse which is the mission of family resources
8565261 when we see a child having a meltdown or a child standing dangerously in a shopping cart we dont know what to do
8565262 we are all kind of helpless and freeze when we see others in this situation what we want to do is enable people to assist these parents
8565263 the video showed how people could assist parents with their children through gentle intervention
8565264 i came aboard the project in the fall of 2002 when my boys were almost 3 and 5
8565265 we knew it was a great concept but we asked ourselves how can we get everyday people to understand and use this concept
8565266 lets just say that my younger son has always been an intense and loud child i was living it
8565267 i never got to meet him and i wanted to know his thoughts and plans for the program
8565268 what is the first thing you see on the show
8565269 we want people to stop and recognize when they may be able to help a parent or child take a moment to pause think and get ready to assist and three try one kind word to assist
8565270 getting involved may be as simple as standing closer to a shopping cart where a child is standing and in a dangerous situation while the parent is busy with another child
8565271 that was a lot of fun we filmed the video at the giant eagle in the waterworks from midnight to 6 a m here we are filming a video about child abuse and we had children there in the middle of the night
8565272 we had to get all sorts of waivers and special permission to make it
8565273 based on our feedback we can say that we can really impact how people can help parents in difficult situations
8565274 we want it to be a regional showpiece we want to put the message out in our region that one kind word can make a difference to someone
8565275 we have been talking with a major grocery store chain and other places such as museums and amusement parks we feel that anywhere large groups of families with children gather will be the ideal sites for the program
8565276 this gorgeous 2 10 ct platinum diamond engagement ring is sure to amaze you amp your loved one

8565293 for the past five years alberta has enjoyed strong employment growth high levels of worker productivity and low durations of unemployment making it the best performing labour market overall
8565294 the research highlights the diverging labour markets within canada western provinces are enjoying strong labour markets while the rest of canada lags behind
8565295 the highest unemployment rates in north america are found in the atlantic provinces
8565296 despite newfoundlands burgeoning resource sector it continues to struggle with an average unemployment rate of 15 2 per cent more than three times the unemployment rate found in alberta
8565297 the split between private and public sector employment is an important aspect of labour market performance since the incentives productivity and performance of labour activity in the private sector is different from that in the public sector
8565298 lower labour productivity in the public sector is particularly problematic given that workers in the public sector tend to receive a wage premium compared to their private sector counterparts
8565299 canadian provinces should reduce public sector employment pursue more balanced and less prescriptive labour laws and avoid increasing minimum wages to improve the functioning of their labour markets

8565309 of course im pleased with the result but im disappointed also because gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem
8565310 we knew he would be like this because he has had that problem for a while he has to do this now because he has pain and he had it when he went away with national team
8565311 we knew he had the problem in the first leg and yesterday our doctor talked about this situation steven said he would play with pain and afterwards he would have the operation today was ok he kept going because he knows hes going to the surgeon tomorrow its not very serious but he has pain so we needed to do it
8565312 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside we are not making any comment on speculation
8565313 upload your writing photography and perspective i have to ask myself this question after i received a flyer advertising the latest chapter in the easy history it begs the question
8565314 today we have a great crisis in georgia a big war is starting i think our patriarch told us to pray every day
8565315 today georgians are praying for mary and for our country today the whole of georgia prays to saint mary that she saves georgia from wars from damages from the devil
8565316 if it had not been for the professional and calm actions of the driver we would have been talking about the death and serious injuries of fire officers this morning
8565317 we received a number of calls at 11 30pm saying a caravan was on fire in a garden at juniper rise in twinbrook
8565318 as the fire crew from lisburn road station were making their way along stewartstown road they could see a ferocious blaze in the distance that is when they came under attack the crew proceeded on to the house where they courageously tackled the fire
8565319 there had been an explosion and the fire had spread to the house the occupant was suffering from smoke inhalation and shock no doubt if the crew had not continued on to the scene the incident would have escalated and endangered the life of the occupant

8565321 i think thomas cook is consolidated we have seen spectacular volumes in the last 5 6 sessions have shown this upmove with very good volumes in the short term we are in somewhere around rs 110 115 so that would be the kind of price target i would work for short to medium term we have been recommending this for about two weeks now
8565322 so taking overall if secondary market price comes to rs 530 by 4th september he should get out of the stock or he must make a point to tender his shares in open offer otherwise once the open offer is closed he will see the price plummeting to around rs 400 410 levels so this is the overall strategy for the next one week on the stock

8565347 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8565348 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8565349 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8565350 excessive green taxes hit poorer people hardest hurt the competitiveness of british firms cause britain to export emissions and fall disproportionately on residents of rural and suburban areas
8565351 the government has fuelled public scepticism by failing to use tax breaks and public spending to make it cheaper and easier to go green if green taxes are to work the government must also invest in greener alternatives such as public transport
8565352 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8565353 the advantage is that it puts him at his best hes a great speaker he moves audiences quite emotionally so i think theres a great advantage for him
8565354 but the mccain effort to paint him as a celebrity is something he has to watch and if this comes off as closer to a rock concert as opposed to a speech to a nation from someone likely to be president i think it could be detrimental
8565355 this does put obama in an awkward setting where its this im coming from mount olympus to save you sort of thing you have to be very careful with that imagery
8565356 i just dont understand how it mixes with the theme of change
8565357 technically arc is supposed to measure the computational requirements of rendering a specific avatar with a specific attachment combination but it does this in abstract parrots meaning that its units do not correspond directly to any computational power measurement i know of and the abstract parrots fly wherever they damn well please

8565492 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8565493 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc

8565498 our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain we anticipate a lower rate of market growth than in the first half and are therefore taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets nonetheless we remain confident of delivering a result for the year at the upper end of market expectations

8565510 ramping a term used for when patients have to wait in ambulances outside the hospital when there are no free beds
8565511 i certainly know theyve died in the hospital and sitting in the back of the ambulance car has contributed to that mr dutton said today
8565512 theres numerous cases we can talk about where people have been revived from cardiac arrest who have had to wait outside the hospital for up to an hour before they can actually be seen in the hospital
8565513 ramped outside emergency wards but he said the situation would only get worse
8565514 the community of queensland needs to realise this is not the ambulance drivers fault its queensland healths fault
8565515 thats fantastic thats a great effort but theyre not going to be any good if we cant get them to the jobs get them away from the hospitals
8565516 we provide a very professional standard of care but obviously thats limited to what were trained to do
8565517 these people need to go to the next level thats why we have doctors and nurses to extend the level of care
8565518 thats the other side of ramping while its uncomfortable and inconvenient for people sitting in the ambulance its absolutely risking their health and wellbeing by not receiving the level of care they deserve
8565519 theyre the ones receiving the triple 0 phone calls and theyre the ones who then have to make a decision where theyre going to get an ambulance from

8565522 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8565523 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8565524 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8565525 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8565526 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8565527 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8565528 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8565710 while it was a difficult quarter we were successful in reducing our domestic inventory levels by 500 million which should lead to lower markdowns and favorably impact our gross margin rates in the second half of the year
8565711 we expect to generate higher ebitda in the second half of this year as compared to the corresponding period in 2007 as we benefit from our lower domestic inventory levels and continued vigilant expense management given our year to date results and the state of the economy our current full year ebitda forecast which assumes flat to modest comparable store sales declines for the rest of the year is comparable to but no longer exceeds last years ebitda

8565835 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding insight and good instincts america will have the national security leadership we need
8565836 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8565837 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8565838 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8565839 my candidate didnt win but im proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children
8565840 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8565841 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8565842 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8565843 it is indicative of the concern among democratic voters about barack obamas inexperience that after three full days of the democratic national convention president clinton was finally forced to testify that senator obama is ready to be president despite his previous arguments to the contrary
8565844 hit a 500 foot home run he hit all the points
8565845 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running
8565846 in theory we could find someone who is a gifted television commentator and let them run
8565847 i should be the last person to defend him but if he wins this nomination im going to do what i can to help him win
8565848 just to be part of the process of electing what i hope is going to be the next president of the united states is just a tremendous honor for me
8565849 when i got the call i was just so incredibly excited i got chills up and down my spine ever since then ive been pretty much just floating on air and i really feel like my grandparents are kind of shining down on me
8565850 to me age just means so much because my grandfather was 70 when i was born and he was a huge influence on my life and the wisdom that comes from people in their 70s is just amazing i like him mccain obviously because hes a war hero but because he is a war hero and had all of these horrendous things happen to him he doesnt want war i think he can help bring the world to peace through strength
8565851 but mccain is a special person this is probably the last time ill get a chance to help get someone nominated who can make a difference in the world this is the guy for the time
8565852 any disharmony in the democratic party works in our favor
8565853 is just an opportunity for the larger audience the larger national and international audience to see the kind of leader he would be and the vision he has for america
8565854 there will be substantive issues dealt with at this convention and i think thats important when you look at the situations facing the world right now with georgia and russia with the middle east the energy issues that we are facing this is not a time for a party this is a time for real leadership and thoughtful leadership on very important very far reaching impactful issues
8565855 the convention for me isnt about going to a convention
8565856 its about engaging in the political process engaging in your civic duty thats one of the reasons i feel this is important its just kind of the character of who i am and who my family is we engage we dont sit on the sidelines and complain we see issues and we get involved and try to work to make them better
8565857 obamas not my cup of tea but ill vote for him for the partys sake
8565858 the older people are just not that into obama because hes black
8565859 the democrats have to wake up and smell the coffee
8565860 they need to know theres a new man in town
8565861 some of you may not like what i have to say
8565862 mccain is not a perfect man he can be a little emotional but he is fundamentally a good person i would feel comfortable waking up in the morning with john mccain as president
8565863 if you believe what we need is another four years then vote john mccain if you believe we need to take a different track barack obama will start the process of restoring america
8565864 ill be a democrat at the end of the day but if you were sent here by your constituents and you are a person with integrity you stick with how you were sent
8565865 she wanted to be a hillary delegate excuse me where is your ethics am i wrong
8565866 she should have kept her mouth shut or she should step down
8565867 it seemed she was being pushed out of the race
8565868 and when they pushed her they were pushing us because we worked for her
8565869 vote for whoever you want to vote for but remember this never took place because if they hear that were divisive you do nothing but demean the democratic party and put john mccain in office
8565870 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8565871 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8565872 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8565873 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8565874 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8565875 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8565876 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8565877 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8565878 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8565879 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8565880 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8565881 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8565882 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8565883 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8565884 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8565885 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8565886 the fans are brilliant when they are behind us but they have to realise the effect it has when they are not behind us
8565887 our volunteers are putting in time to make sure our houses are safe and to protect our children and i think they are taken for granted
8565888 i know that everyone is burdened that people are struggling just to make ends meet thats why i am only asking for 5 it might sound funny but if everyone works together we can make a big difference
8565889 the more you go on the higher the fuel bill runs
8565890 dormonts an older community in allegheny county with a good housing stock thats close to the city and the t
8565891 they are like a businesss board of directors who need to give me direction and the tools to do the job i think the borough needs to be run like a business
8565892 he is taking an active interest in our community and that is important
8565893 he gets along well with borough workers and he has experience common sense and knows how to get things done just as importantly he knows he is the manager that is his job and the best thing i feel i can do is get out of the way and let him do his job
8565894 he has courage and you need that to set a true positive agenda for dormont
8565895 sometimes with the trivial and the minutiae we have to trust the superintendent on his recommendation
8565896 its not always a matter of trust when youre on a board its a matter of legality
8565897 we are classified as a sport and we treat participants as athletes
8565898 a lot of people dont realize the work that goes into it but its probably one of the hardest sports said ashley contristano 23 varsity cheerleading coach for keystone oaks school district
8565899 these girls are gymnasts and all their movements take tons of precision
8565900 they utilize most of the muscles in their body in doing stunts tumbling or dancing
8565901 they have to be in good physical shape to do all that they do
8565902 i cheered from the time i was in first or second grade and it was a huge part of my life growing up and a really positive experience
8565903 after college i wanted to be able to spend time giving back to the other girls
8565904 as the sport is constantly evolving with more difficult stunts it presents the girls with new challenges and something to work toward to experience that achievement
8565905 i really like being a part of not only cheerleading but in helping them grow into young leaders
8565906 i hope that all the girls are successful not only in cheerleading but in life and any assistance i can lend in that regard is readily given
8565907 its not a bad idea but its just not workable
8565908 i keep telling any student who is going to be new to the school this year not to worry because everyone will be coming back to a new school no one will know their way around
8565909 through this renovation we had to keep the focus on instructional activities
8565910 with the new facilities and the test scores its a very exciting time in the district
8565911 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8565912 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8565913 her prognosis is good as far as the doctor can tell
8565914 the cancer had not yet reached her optic nerve which would have then brought it directly to her brain
8565915 i was okay with our teacher assignment until i realized that not only is my sons new teacher a man wait for it mitch mcdad dont get your boxers in a bunch just yet he is also young and single
8565916 if i had a male teacher in my k 3rd grades i would have freaked
8565917 most people really want men teaching their children but it does happen occasionally
8565918 i had a parent who was complaining and concerned about me working with her daughter
8565919 the kid really liked me a lot and because the child was liking me so much the mother got worried and suspicious
8565920 its an insight into ourselves that we havent really had before
8565921 it is mostly male about 75 78 percent on any given month or week
8565922 when we look at the female component we find that its a much different usage pattern than males theyre looking at sites where people are creating creating texts creating stories erotic stories
8565923 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid
8565924 for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things
8565925 be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through christ jesus

8565928 were seeing a number of guys committing the murders are already marginalised already excluded and we are trying those kind of tactics on those individuals i fear we just make the problem worse
8565929 stop and search is a vital tool against knife crime it has been a key part of blunt 2
8565930 there were 1 592 arrests during that period for possession of knives and other weapons as a result of that 1 445 knives are off the streets
8565931 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8565932 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8565933 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8565934 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8565935 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8565936 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8565937 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks

8565941 of course some innocents can get killed when mobs attack us and we are forced to open fire as a last resort some people who get killed may not be militants

8565947 the housing market and development in general as it relates to the public private sector partnership has gone south
8565948 we are fighting our way through a recessionary period as it relates to low housing starts and just a dismal financial picture as it relates to the business community overall
8565949 there are lots of foreclosures continuing nationally and that adds more inventory to the market
8565950 house prices continue to fall creating negative conditions for equity for homeowners
8565951 foreclosures will continue to rise and a good amount of the sales weve seen particularly of existing homes are fire sales of foreclosed homes being conducted by banks so the housing market remains on a downward trajectory and prices are likely to continue to erode into 2009 nationally and in new jersey
8565952 if you have equity in your home and we can price your house to sell we can sell your home
8565953 have prices adjusted yes they obviously have if you bought your house in 2005 2006 or 2007 you may not be able to get what you paid for it
8565954 were actually at a much slower market than 12 months ago
8565955 but people have to be realistic to expect what to sell their house for
8565956 and a big reason for that is the housing market hasnt recovered and with these negative factors
8565957 i think theres more correction in prices to come because of the very large inventory on the market and the still increasing number of foreclosures putting more supply on the market both nationally and in new jersey
8565958 everyone i know is losing their job companies are closing down and the price of everything is sky high i talk to people every day and there is hardly any hope
8565959 you can only get a good job if youre highly educated and even they are having trouble

8565996 sehr wichtig das kann ich nach all der zeit sagen als ich damals nach deutschland kam kannte ich mich in der formel 3 kaum aus ich wusste nur dass michael schumacher die serie gewonnen hatte damals bin ich im team von willi weber gestartet und habe viele rennen gewonnen es war ein tolles auto und ein toller motor diese saison lief f r mich perfekt auch international das formel 3 masters konnte ich gewinnen und auch in macau den zweiten platz einfahren diese erfolge haben mein weiteres leben einfacher gemacht ich kam leichter in die formel 3000 und sp ter in die formel 1
8565997 meine zeit in der formel 3 war auf jeden fall wichtig im team von willi weber lief damals alles perfekt und ich konnte viele siege einfahren toll waren mein dritter platz in monaco und der sieg beim formel 3 masters in zandvoort das auto war sehr gut und auch die zusammenarbeit mit den ingenieuren es war wichtig f r die weitere karriere in deutschland eine gute saison zu haben und die hatte ich
8565998 gibt es ein besonderes erlebnis an das ihr euch erinnert
8565999 alle siege waren super und haben viel spa gemacht aber der vorletzte sieg in hockenheim war schon besonders da ich damit den meistertitel sicher hatte ich f hlte mich damals sehr stark schlie lich bin ich gegen schnelle fahrer wie marco werner oder j rg m ller gefahren
8566000 jedes rennen hat viel spa gemacht ich muss zugeben dass die ersten beiden l ufe noch schwierig f r mich waren aber ab dann bin ich zumindest immer zweiter oder dritter gewesen das auto lief einfach berall gut doch besonders gut haben mir die stra en und flugplatzrennen gefallen hier konnte niemand vorher testen wir hatten alle nur das freie training und dann ging es auch schon ins qualifying man musste von anfang an zeigen was man drauf hat
8566001 die formel 3 ist immer noch die wohl wichtigste nachwuchsserie im formelsport die autos sind den formel 1 autos ziemlich hnlich nat rlich ist die formel 1 technisch viel weiter entwickelt im formel 3 musst du sehr rund fahren da die reine ps leistung nicht so hoch ist aber seit meiner zeit hat sich schon einiges ver ndert dallara ist nun fast die einzige chassismarke es fehlt die konkurrenz auch die kosten waren nicht so hoch was den einstig f r junge fahrer einfacher gemacht hat
8566002 gehe nie einen schritt weiter bevor du siegf hig bist der sieg ist der schl ssel zu allem
8566003 die formel 3 ist immer professioneller geworden und damit leider auch teurer das macht den anfang f r die fahrer schwerer denn sie starten ja erst ihre karriere und meist mit wenig geld klar die entwicklung ist nicht aufzuhalten und wahrscheinlich die kostensituation auch nicht wer ganz vorne sein will muss das gr te talent das beste material die besten ingenieure und das beste team haben doch ich glaube dass speziell im formel 3 sport sehr schnell zu entdecken ist ob talent vorhanden ist oder nicht
8566004 welchen rat habt ihr f r die jungen formel 3 fahrer
8566005 sie sollen versuchen den wagen zu verstehen und auf jeden fall sollen sie jede runde genie en die formel 3 monoposti sind einfach sch ne autos aber im vordergrund stehen immer noch das ergebnis und der sieg erst dann sollte man sich ber n chste schritte gedanken machen eines m ssen sich die aufsteiger merken gehe nie einen schritt weiter bevor du siegf hig bist der sieg ist der schl ssel zu allem
8566006 es braucht eine gute zusammenarbeit mit dem team und den ingenieuren wenn ich nicht schnell genug bin dann muss ich mich und die daten analysieren auf jeden fall muss ich einen so professionellen job wie m glich machen die chance formel 3 zu fahren muss man mit beiden h nden packen und ausnutzen man sollte auch nie den zweiten vor dem ersten schritt tun und die serie bestreiten die finanzierbar ist deshalb finde ich den formel 3 cup als gelungenes angebot f r den einstieg
8566007 fear not death for i have seen it fear only the reaper for he will have his twisted way with you first
8566008 if its yellow let it mellow if its brown flush it down
8566009 consumers just simply couldnt tell a good distributor from a bad one
8566010 a vast amount of products is available but those sold from sites that offer to sell directly to the public or that offer unacceptable means of diagnosis do not meet our standards
8566011 we will not hesitate to take action against those who undermine public health
8566012 one product we found called original herbal ecstasy contained nutmeg which is hallucinogenic in sufficient quantities hallucinogenic mushrooms and a lot of stimulants
8566013 yet there is no way of telling how much of these substances is in there most packets contain no information about side effects or the potential of mixing these substances with things such as alcohol or other medications they could cause a range of psychiatric disturbances from anxiety to panic attacks to psychosis
8566014 there is considerable risk to the public from obtaining medicines through unregulated websites
8566015 there is no guarantee of safety quality or effectiveness it could be counterfeit or out of date it may not contain the right amount of medicine there is no ongoing treatment monitoring at worst it may cause severe side effects its not worth it
8566016 he did a great job for both former gov bill weld and i hes a very smart strong leader hes the guy im hoping will run
8566017 we are even closer now and let me tell you this time were going to win

8566019 sen mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics
8566020 the rove mccain tactics are old and outworn and america will reject them in 2008
8566021 its not so unlike my own election race is with us but i think the american public is a lot further along than the media gives them credit
8566022 its not unfamiliar to me but you just keep going
8566023 hes never lost sight that this is not about him
8566024 i didnt run for this job to get another job
8566025 the governing i want to do is for the long term
8566026 all that stuff is right in our sweet spot in massachusetts
8566027 im not a registered lobbyist there are people in the firm who are but im not
8566028 barack obama decries washington insiders and detests lobbyists but joe biden is the model washington insider with numerous connections to lobbyists
8566029 joe biden has a 35 year record standing up to powerful interests from big oil companies to big drug companies and big insurance companies
8566030 anders skade er naturligvis et stort slag for os han er vores n glespiller i angrebet og i forsvaret spiller han ogs en stor rolle
8566031 the vuelta has always been in my calendar and always on my mind i am going with the idea of doing something important
8566032 i want to enjoy this race i am at the final years of my career i dont know if i will race one or two more years and i want to enjoy this to the maximum but without obsessing about anything i am going with my homework completed and i only want to arrive and think about the race it will be a beautiful vuelta
8566033 with riders like cuesta van goolen and gustov carlos will get some solid support in the mountains where the race might well be decided we have great experience in the shape of michael blaudzun who will be doing his last big stage race of his career and is no doubt highly motivated
8566034 in matti breschel and juan jos haedo we have two great closers whore able to do really well in the finales and maybe take some of the pressure off for the others with a victory early on in the race
8566035 karsten kroon and kolobnev are experts in neutralizing attacks and especially karsten will play a central role in protecting carlos in the peloton if necessary
8566036 all in all it looks like we have an exciting vuelta ahead of us and we look forward to seeing our guys in action

8566054 we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is
8566055 weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india
8566056 its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage
8566057 playing one day cricket there i know how hard it is
8566058 but to play test cricket with the wickets and playing five day cricket its going to be extremely hard but its a challenge im looking forward to
8566059 theyre a fairly young side and theyre going to go pretty hard
8566060 were going to do the same thing were not going to give them an inch and hopefully its going to be a good series
8566061 we have been going at top speed up to now
8566062 it is sad we had hoped that more people would be buying our cars
8566063 but improving the quality of our cars is our utmost priority this kind of time can prove important
8566064 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8566065 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8566066 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8566067 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8566068 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8566069 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8566070 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8566071 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8566072 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention centre
8566073 you must remain here and continue fighting if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated

8566087 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8566088 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8566089 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8566090 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8566091 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8566092 moral legal and practical gravity to publicize it to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
8566093 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8566094 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8566095 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face
8566096 assault identification of explosives scouting weapons and ammunition searches or rescue and release
8566097 neutralize and attack hostile elements seizes a subject and wont let go
8566098 race colour sex language religion political or other opinion national ethnic or social origin property disability birth or other status
8566099 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8566100 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8566101 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8566102 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8566103 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8566104 coalition of israeli palestinian and international ngos united against the practice of torture and ill treatment in israel and the occupied palestinian territories opt
8566105 torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
8566106 to various stakeholders in israel and the opt including the eu tel aviv delegation ecd european commission technical assistance office for the west bank and gaza ectao eu ambassadors and or other relevant eu contact persons in eu missions and ngos particularly active in this field
8566107 the eu and its member states contribute to the prevention and eradication of torture
8566108 combat ing impunity to hold perpetrators liable establish ing reporting procedures and provid ing reparation and rehabilitation for victims
8566109 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct
8566110 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
8566111 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise
8566112 israeli law has abolished the death penalty for murder and corporal punishment
8566113 fundamental human rights founded upon recognition of the value of the human being the sanctity of human life and the principle that all persons are free
8566114 to protect human life dignity and assure that all government authorities are bound to respect these rights under this basic law
8566115 officially proclaimed a state of public emergency from 19 may 1948 four days after its founding until the present day
8566116 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
8566117 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
8566118 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
8566119 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8566120 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
8566121 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal
8566122 there is never a good moment to raise human rights questions and always a reason for not doing something
8566123 strongly and consistently promot ing full compliance with basic and absolute legal obligations to protect individuals most fundamental rights
8566124 ive seen this movie before and i know how it ends

8566128 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8566129 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8566130 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8566131 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8566132 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8566133 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8566134 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8566135 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8566136 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8566172 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8566173 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8566174 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8566175 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8566176 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8566177 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8566178 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8566179 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8566180 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8566181 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8566182 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8566183 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8566184 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8566185 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8566186 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8566187 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
8566188 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
8566189 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
8566190 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8566191 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8566192 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8566193 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8566194 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8566195 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8566196 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8566197 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8566198 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8566199 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8566200 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8566201 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8566202 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8566203 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8566204 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8566205 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

8566217 i cant be no more confident than i am right now
8566218 i had to have something special about me to make it back from this injury
8566219 she said im going to hit the winning goal were going to end this right now
8566220 and i said alright pick a corner she did it and we went on to the conference championship
8566221 i had a lot of great teammates and actually had a boyfriend
8566222 when it comes to taking that next step in your life and what you think is going to be best for you i really had to buckle down and see that this is best decision for me
8566223 luckily i had my phone on i couldnt hear much but to receive that phone call made the moment even more memorable
8566224 the pride associated with winning a gold medal for your country is indescribable
8566225 most teams have one or two key or star players during the olympic tournament we relied on all 18 players for a win that is the type of teamwork i hope to bring to syracuse everyone should work together and not rely on one or two people
8566226 we had to make the decision for the future on the d o
8566227 the budget concern was only part of the friday cut but it is also a way for new media implementation
8566228 we hope to tailor content toward students and our online readership to provide further coverage of the universitys news
8566229 its a world game what better way to celebrate than with a world record
8566230 we put out an online survey to see what cities could be on it
8566231 i think expanding the librarys hours is a great idea
8566232 but as a vpa student the books i would need would not be accessible
8566233 opening the library for those designated hours is great but not enough
8566234 since its our main library it should be accessible all the time
8566235 you can see in political science or history or in arts and science where you would want to look at music and poetry it really resonates with a lot of the departments in the university
8566236 if you can win the sec championship odds are you can play for the national championship and that says a lot about the league
8566237 when people look at the pre season magazines there are a lot of people who say that a two loss sec team depending on what happens elsewhere in the country can compete for a national championship again
8566238 weve got more national championships we got more players in the pros so our talent level in this conference in the best in the country the quality of our coaches is the best in the country
8566239 nobody likes the feeling that your teams not winning because of this group
8566240 i feel like every year ive been here its been kind of the same situation and every year you try and go out and you dont want people to believe that about your unit
8566241 when we talked about recruiting we saw that the greatest need that we had was to redevelop an offensive line here and that it mightve been the weakest spot on the football team when you go out and recruit a number of players it takes a period of time for the offensive line to develop
8566242 i was really fascinated to see all the political players come together and to be a part of it
8566243 theres nothing like being there and being involved to see it from the inside
8566244 oh im a fan and i just want to hang out with you
8566245 pittsburgh is a blue collar town and id like to think thats the type of person i am in my background and my work ethic
8566246 and i think that is reflected in our football team
8566247 ill tell you what they picked the right guy for the job
8566248 he brings so much to the university hes just a pittsburgh guy
8566249 all three of my boys have it she had a smile that lit the whole community up she was very promising but god had another plan for her
8566250 bringing in a show like this really solidifies our reputation
8566251 the exhibit tries to provide a portrait of who he was
8566252 i think that they shouldnt have done it because when i had come to this college that was one of the things that i liked that i could take classes over at su
8566253 i never got an e mail about it or anything
8566254 i just went on orange myslice and saw that i got kicked out of it
8566255 ive been here long enough 26 years that ive gone through this before
8566256 its kind of dej vu all over again the only difference is that this time the cuts are deep enough that it is likely to affect some student programs
8566257 were waiting to see what these guys can do to find out what were good at
8566258 were much improved but we still have to go out and play
8566259 everybody has their reasons why they do or dont like something so its not really for me to say thats a good reason not to like it or thats not a good reason not to like it
8566260 you play the game and you see what you think
8566261 at e3 we let people play the game for a half hour and if in a half hour you can make up your mind one way or the other ok i dont really get into judging the rightness or wrongness of it i just give people a chance to play it and they draw their own conclusions
8566262 working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus and that well
8566263 tokyos more focused on consumers so were still working on the intricacies
8566264 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8566265 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8566266 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days

8566316 when barack obama accepts the democratic nomination to become the president of the united states of america and starts speaking i think all of america and many parts of the world the hopes the longings the aspirations and the dreams will be hanging on every word he says
8566317 its going to be incredible you know people died some people didnt make it to the march on washington they were beaten they were tear gassed some were shot and killed and even after the march on washington where there had been so much hope so much optimism we had to deal with the bombing on a church in birmingham where four little girls were killed but ive cried all my tears
8566318 he is free of a lot of the battles and scars that many of us suffered
8566319 he never saw the signs that said white men colored men white women colored women
8566320 he never tasted the fruits of segregation and racial discrimination so he is a different human being he should be free to liberate the rest of america and maybe take a message to the rest of the world
8566321 the equivalent insulation to a typical football uniform is like wearing a full three piece mens business suit
8566322 its not uncommon during prolonged intense exercise for us to be able to measure temperatures in athletes of 103 or 104 degrees fahrenheit
8566323 take frequent breaks that allow players to get out of the sun and into the shade allow them to take their helmets off during breaks and in some cases their shirts and shoulder pads anything to periodically cool the players
8566324 i remember last year we had a game where the heat was just excruciating
8566325 and we were playing a county school and they dont follow the same rules as we do

8566580 if downside risks to the dollar emerge from here on the market will keep in mind the possibility of similar action by authorities
8566581 the report would have had a huge psychological impact if it had come out when the dollar was trading around 100 yen
8566582 if anything the fact that officials recognized the concern about the dollars decline seems somewhat supportive for the dollar as maybe benign neglect was not so neglectful
8566583 at the end of the day however president bush is still set to be the first american president since at least the break up of bretton woods that has not authorized intervention in the fx market and given the recent price action the distinction looks relatively safe

8566587 we have been going at top speed up to now
8566588 it is sad we had hoped that more people would be buying our cars
8566589 but improving the quality of our cars is our utmost priority this kind of time can prove important
8566590 as consumers increasingly turn to the internet to buy medications brandholders must ensure these customers are not faced with the potentially life threatening risk of buying fake or sub standard medications

8566592 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country

8566598 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8566599 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8566600 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8566601 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8566602 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8566603 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8566604 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8566605 es ist f r mich ganz klar dass das bz zur salzburger landtagswahl antreten wird
8566606 i just felt at that moment that i didnt make a difference
8566607 the combination of rapidly increasing costs for payroll and benefits for our police department is too much for us to handle right now

8566609 its not in its facilities its not in its police force or ambulance service
8566610 what did you do on you do on your summer vacation
8566611 i didnt do anything this summer i will fly to tampa in the fall to visit my son but i booked the airfare during a sale if he didnt live there i would not be going anywhere just making short trips
8566612 i went to ocean city md with my family we drove so the gas was the worst part it was six hours from pittsburgh i havent gone on a family vacation for about 10 years so it made a great summer for me
8566613 it was just awful i took a bus to syracuse n y to work at a carnival then the carnival company didnt give me my final pay so a friend had to drive me home to pittsburgh
8566614 we went canoeing near dawson and we bought a house because of the bad real estate market we were able to get an excellent deal on our house
8566615 despite the economy for me it was a blessed summer i went to myrtle beach for a week and will be going to jamaica in the fall i did have a car accident but that forced me to grow up a bit
8566616 i did my usual work around the house things such as cutting the grass if they did something about the gas prices id be able to go somewhere
8566617 it was a good summer we were married on july 19 and went to las vegas on our honeymoon we saw cirque du soleil and stayed in the honeymoon suite at the bellagio we hung out at the pool and went to fancy restaurants
8566618 we combined several trips that we would have taken separately we visited family in boston and friends in vermont we went in my wifes car because she gets 33 miles per gallon
8566619 finally i asked lloyd what are your views on this
8566620 its another viable business per se on eighth avenue which is good for the business district
8566621 a lot of churches have the service first then the dinner so people will stick around
8566622 regardless of what you think about jesus you can have a meal
8566623 i got to see these kids at the heart level
8566624 i wish id would have made friends with him years ago
8566625 i believe this ministry is to encompass the whole life experience the good and the bad
8566626 i got all set up and we had a blast
8566627 it was a rough summer because of president bush we are fighting wars and the whole economy is messed up and everyone is hurting he doesnt care about black people or the middle class
8566628 this summer was the best ever i had a wonderful week in ocean city md with my wife sons and in laws we stayed right on the boardwalk my boys ages 2 and 3 thought that was the cats meow we also went to kennywood sandcastle waterpark the pittsburgh zoo as well as the beach
8566629 i worked a lot and used public transportation gas prices are so high it was worse than most summers because i worked so much
8566630 i did nothing not because of the economy its just that we are always homebodies
8566631 i was busy planning my move from the san francisco bay area to pittsburgh and i was busy preparing for the classes i will teach this semester but i did take a trip to indonesia consulting for the asian development bank we were trying to help poor entrepreneurs in the small villages secure financing and expand their businesses the villages were hot the accommodations and food were pretty poor but i was blown away that a lot of indonesian businesses are women owned indonesians treat women better than most moslem countries women are considered equals and treated with courtesy and respect
8566632 we visited washington state and spent four days travelling along the west coast we also enjoyed five days in seattle the economy had no effect because we planned the trip before the economy went south i really enjoyed my summer i have a great job my two children were home from college all is well with them and they were both employed my husband was able to participate in weekend astronomy conventions
8566633 gas prices didnt affect me too much we pitt students have a bus pass but i needed to plan activities in advance around the port authority schedule
8566634 we just figured with the increase in boat traffic every year our 16 foot aluminum was not up to snuff
8566635 were just trying to make sure that everybodys safe thats all
8566636 he slows down and you dont see him you go right up the back
8566637 with this one theres too much potential that people will get hurt
8566638 originally we had the concept of doing a three or four story facade on the side of the under renovation denis theater that involved a trolley people walking
8566639 when they asked me to redesign it it was basically just the idea of doing the walking thing
8566640 we have 130 kids paid 20 teachers 40 artists 50 ex offenders a fitness manager a music manager a fashion manager
8566641 the wall is really irregular a lot of different sizes and textures
8566642 we were talking about pittsburgh 250 and some of the highlights of pittsburgh and one of the things that was mentioned was phipps conservatory so i took inspirations from that
8566643 it kind of ties in with all of the businesses we talk about it being a little garden for the neighborhood
8566644 i cant tell you how many people have stopped in to tell us how much they like that mural
8566645 this was done without township county city or anyone elses money we did this all on our own and i think thats very important
8566646 the buildings in better shape now than when we started
8566647 the prep work probably took two weeks to get it solid but its worth the time to get it right because it adds length to the life of the artwork
8566648 kind of the fun part of doing this mural is that its in my neighborhood i hear people talking about it a few think a new business is going in there is it a garden shop or a travel agency opening up
8566649 im taking a stay cation next month when were going to visit all the cultural spots in the burg places such as the sen john heinz history center the andy warhol the carnegie museum of art and the like we had planned to go to chautauqua an educational institute in southwestern new york state but the cost of gas for our type of vehicle put that trip on the back burner
8566650 the high cost of fuel most certainly factored into my familys summer activities we stayed closer to home our cars run on diesel fuel and as one knows it costs significantly more than gasoline
8566651 economically it certainly was a worse summer than normal as the cost of just about everything has skyrocketed but personally summer with my family was delightful no matter that we stayed close to home
8566652 i never fill up my gas tank anymore this year i loved being in my garden and spending time biking on the montour and youghiogheny trails
8566653 i spent time and money to travel for a month in india this summer my dollar went further there the u s dollar is worth about 44 indian rupees even though the dollar is down overseas against the euro things are still affordable in india
8566654 i golfed a lot and hung out with friends the economy didnt interfere with that it was a summer like any other
8566655 the economy didnt necessary affect me i was just too busy to vacation this year we added an extra dining room in the restaurant and that kept me very busy if you give people good service and good value they will continue to frequent your restaurant
8566656 strains on the economy mean that people tip less it also hit me when i flew to the jersey shore and my plane ticket was more than usual and the airlines also charged me 15 for a bag
8566657 i traveled only once to lancaster county to visit my grandchildren in previous years i would have gone five times over the summer but the cost of gas has really impacted me
8566658 also the cost of pet care has really gone up
8566659 it was the worst summer ever both my parents lost their jobs i stayed home and hung out with friends still we went to the pool and kennywood
8566660 i just returned from toronto canada this morning a friend was driving there so i tagged along it was fun we met up with his family and friends for barbecues
8566661 i took a trip to baltimore with friends we split the costs of gas and hotel i made do with the situation so the summer was fine
8566662 theology professor william schweiker said that he has no problem with the economics department creating a research institute honoring friedman but that such large scale investment by the university could be better utilized by spreading it among a range of disciplines

8566667 obviously we are not pleased to be publishing in the community a budget that contains deficit spending
8566668 but the reality is that the tax cap has now caught up with us and we are moving into what is likely to be a phase of deficit spending at least for the near term
8566669 the stress on the budget is only exacerbated by a 600 000 drop in investment earnings and that is nothing we have any control over its a function of the economy and the market
8566670 any school district that is under that tax cap sooner or later comes to a place where there will be a budget shortfall
8566671 district 39 has planned for this eventuality and our deficit spending is planned and controlled
8566672 there will be laughter there will be tears and youll learn something about how we can turn the outcome of this disease if we just set our minds to it

8566697 the pumping of acid into the soil and aquifers will leave behind acid and radioactive wastes in some of the aquifers within the mine lease for many years mr noonan said
8566698 its actually causing greater environmental impact over a larger area
8566699 it is incredibly disappointing to see peter garrett of all people allowing such a thing to take place given the current state of water in australia and in south australia in particular senator ludlam said
8566700 it should be completely unacceptable in this day and age
8566701 i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator mr garrett said
8566702 my decision demonstrates the governments commitment to ensuring worlds best practice environmental standards for uranium mining in this country

8566707 remember that on the sixth day god took a rib from adam and fashioned eve making him the first surgeon therefore medicine is the oldest profession
8566708 but before that god created the heavens and earth from chaos and confusion and thus he was the first engineer therefore engineering is an older profession than medicine
8566709 yes but who do you think created all of the chaos and confusion

8566725 there were some key concerns i had on a personal level that made me think it was best for me to step back
8566726 i was concerned about the lack of management and professionalism in some of the shows
8566727 it is important to stress that no one connected to crescent radio is a member of hizb ut tahrir or any other organisation like that but my concern is that hizb ut tahrir members views were being aired without a counter argument being provided
8566728 no one was advocating violence or terrorism and i appreciate it is a community station and cannot be managed and monitored 24 hours a day but there still should have been safeguards in place so the station gives a balanced view
8566729 if someone said to me islamic culture is about extremism and terrorism i would rightly be very offended because it is a false generalisation and it was that kind of thing which i was concerned about
8566730 we do not ban anybody but i do agree that one or two presenters have invited some guests on too often
8566731 we are a community station and we do give our presenters a bit of leeway to run the shows how they like
8566732 but i have been explicit in the guidelines i have given them
8566733 we are about giving the community a voice and bringing communities together and that means giving people of all types of belief a platform to air their views

8566737 sobre todo porque sab a sorprenderte muchas de las historias que me cont ese d a y otros m s que le siguieron las puede aprovechar en algunas de mis novelas posteriores dicen que un escritor ha de saber escuchar el problema es que la mayor parte de quienes se autodenominan autores est n m s pendientes de s mismos que de lo que ocurre a su alrededor hablan hablan y hablan sin que el ruido de su conversaci n permita descubrir otras voces
8566738 ten a un peculiar sentido del humor que me cost asimilar pero despu s de dos o tres ribeiros estaba m s suelto que un gato callejero fue entonces cuando me cont algunas an cdotas de su trabajo en un crematorio y los problemas con los que se encontraban muchas familias cuando ten an que aventar las cenizas de sus parientes ya sabes desde que se les cayera al mar la urna hasta regresar a casa a ducharse porque el viento hab a acabado devolvi ndoles las cenizas y por mucho que muchas mujeres quieran a sus maridos no les resulta muy agradable tragarse sus restos aunque s lo sean polvo
8566739 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8566740 it will be between bryant johnson and ashley lelie bryant johnson if hes well looks like he was able to go today pretty good so itll be nice to see him and at the other position it will be isaac bruce and arnaz battle three wide receivers obviously all three receivers will be in the game at the same time
8566741 yes those guys havent played much so a quarter if not a half i hope to see more of them some of the reps will depend on them if they start to feel it tightening up or whatever they absolutely wont get as much i hope that does not occur because just liked we talked about we want to get in that first season game with that healthy group
8566742 we did put a lot of emphasis these practices this week we went good against good the entire week which is not typical for this week so we got a lot of good work and that was exactly what you guys were talking about j t osullivan got a lot of work with those guys that you were talking about in practice even though it maybe limited in the game like i said we tried to get in three days here this week as opposed to one game and i thought that was more important
8566743 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8566744 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8566745 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8566746 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8566747 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8566748 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8566749 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8566750 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8566751 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8566752 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8566753 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8566754 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8566755 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8566756 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8566757 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8566758 additionally it offers a whole new viewing vehicle for our original video programming currently only available on ew com

8566760 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8566761 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8566763 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8566764 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8566765 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8566766 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8566767 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8566768 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8566769 the serbian governments position on kosovo is well known and remains unchanged
8566770 at the proper time we warned that any unilateral declaration of kosovos independence can provoke a domino effect unfortunately that is now happening
8566771 we expect that the situation wont have a negative impact on us
8566772 the information that we received is that russsia continues to uphold its earlier position

8566774 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8566775 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8566776 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8566777 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8566778 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8566779 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8566780 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8566781 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8566782 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8566792 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8566793 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8566794 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8566796 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8566797 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8566798 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8566799 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8566800 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8566801 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8566802 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8566803 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8566804 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8566805 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8566806 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8566807 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8566808 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8566809 who are open to doing something on the production side
8566810 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8566811 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8566812 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8566813 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8566814 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8566815 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8566816 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8566817 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8566897 the risk of a downward spiral in house prices is the primary danger facing the american economy
8566898 the current decline in house prices is the natural result of a bubble that by 2006 had raised house prices to 60 above their long term trend the sharp decline since then means that todays prices are about 15 above the trend level but while a further 15 decline may be inevitable there is nothing to stop prices declining even further

8566911 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
8566912 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8566913 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8566914 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8566915 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
8566916 if a minister be persuaded that any person who presents himself to be a partaker of the holy communion ought not to be admitted thereunto by reason of malicious and open contention with his neighbours or other grave and open sin without repentance he shall give an account of the same to the ordinary of the place and therein obey his order and direction but so as not to refuse the sacrament to any person until in accordance with such order and direction he shall have called him and advertised him that in any wise he presume not to come to the lords table provided that in case of grave and immediate scandal to the congregation the minister shall not admit such person but shall give an account of the same to the ordinary within seven days after at the latest and therein obey the order and direction given to him by the ordinary provided also that before issuing his order and direction in relation to any such person the ordinary shall afford him an opportunity for interview

8566935 ich frage mich warum kein neuer investor gefunden wurde warum niemand bereit war in das team zu investieren das team ist super gefahren es war eine sch ne zeit aber zuletzt war es ein einziges auf und ab wegen der sponsorensuche jetzt muss man eben sehen wie sich die dinge bei den fahrern entwickeln ich will schon noch zwei bis drei jahre rad fahren bisher habe ich mich nicht bei anderen teams umgeschaut weil ich bis zuletzt die hoffnung hatte dass wir noch einen sponsor finden aber heute ist der punkt gekommen wo wir auf andere teams zugehen werden und uns umh ren jetzt muss man mal sehen wie wir unter diesen umst nden die deutschland tour fahren werden

8566945 kita menduga ini ada intervensi dari pejabat negara kalau ingin memutuskan penangguhan penahanan kenapa harus tunggu tunggu kan bertiga saja bisa

8566980 out of all the ugly americans of the modern hard right john mccain is rising as the star his entire worldview is based not just upon american exceptionalism but upon mccain exceptionalism verb noun p o w he cant remember how many houses he owns through his joint property marriage in arizona with his heiress wife and thinks 5 million is the cut on point for rich i doubt highly that he knows the price of bread or the rise in the cost of milk over the last year unless its from a briefing by his staff the nearest he gets to the common american is talking to his coterie of advisors who all wear lobbyist or think tank hats too and apparently do all his thinking for him on someone elses dime meanwhile he accuses others of uppity elitism oblivious to the irony
8566981 had been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities

8566989 twelve dead bodies of the insurgents were left on the battlefield
8566990 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8566991 all i can say is that im sorry for his death and im sorry for his parents
8566992 the japanese government strongly deplores all kinds of terrorist activities and heinous criminal acts such as kidnapping and murder and we renew our determination to fight terrorism
8566993 i also feel that as others in the international community are making brave sacrifices to continue their efforts to bring peace and reconstruction to afghanistan japan too must continue to do whatever it can

8567002 takes lots of time and reporting and lots of resources
8567003 the real question is who is going to be paying for all of this work
8567004 takes lots of time and reporting and lots of resources
8567005 the real question is who is going to be paying for all of this work
8567006 where is the advertising and how quickly does it move online and how quickly do the rates increase that is going to be key for all of us
8567007 can you show us how much you can move it levi
8567008 well i think weve got a bit of mobility there exercise everyday and in a few weeks im hopeful youll be able to curve that finger right down into a fist levi
8567009 i know it doesnt look like much but considering how serious this fracture was and the fact hes just had his pins removed hes moving it more than you or i could we can work with this
8567010 buddy tape index to middle and show them the exercises
8567011 what weve got is a knot of scar tissue from the original break and then the surgery that levi needs to slowly stretch through
8567012 we dont want it too tight just snug and right above this seam here
8567013 so because they are attached when the middle finger moves its teaching that stiff index finger how to bend also like a gentle way of training
8567014 if we didnt buddy tape that index to the middle finger it would be very easy for other fingers all to bend and do the necessary work of writing holding a utensil grabbing something while the index finger stays rigid

8567016 clearly the economic environment is significantly more challenging in 2008 but we are on track to outperform the market for the full year especially in the regional advertising market
8567017 the board is confident in continuing to execute its growth strategy and the company will continue to outperform in 2009

8567019 i cannot understand why health authorities seem to think kidney cancer patients have less right to live than other people
8567020 i am lucky that someone has answered my prayers and is paying for my drug but i am fighting for all the others out there who will come after me in the hope they will not have to battle while they are dying
8567021 sutent has made me feel more like my old self and ive only been on it for three weeks
8567022 i want the chairman of nice to come down and speak to these people
8567023 you are going to get zealots the very people for whom zanjeer zani has always been a hotbed using the practice to make a political point we are concerned that they may say this is mans law and gods law is higher but this is not gods law and like the concept of jihad is misunderstood by some it is not a religious edict but a state of mind
8567024 the authorities should have been educating the community we fear a small percentage will make children do the zanjeer zani in defiance i believe islamaphobia has coloured this case and this will make the shia community think about where they stand in the community
8567025 we dont condone anyone under the age of 16 doing it but we do believe that after the age of 12 a boy can start making his own decisions and if a teenager is built like a brick outhouse and wants to do it you cant stop them doing it
8567026 some of the people do it so hard the skin flays off their breast but the police have never stopped them children who do the zanjeer zani have been doing the matam since they were little babies if mr zaidi goes to jail we may see copycats who want to go to jail to highlight the issue
8567027 this sort of practice has been going on throughout the islamic world for centuries and although there have been cases like this in the past they havent been brought to court
8567028 because of this case this practice has now been highlighted and this law is now being brought to the attention of the community before our community didnt know about the law
8567029 the community and community leaders are now working together with the cps and the police to bring about a code of practice to benefit everyone
8567030 we cannot eliminate this practice but we can and will work to a code of practice so that the children dont get hurt the law isnt broken and the people who do want to take part dont get prosecuted
8567031 we have to take into account peoples beliefs and their rights and we will respect them but we are not above the law and we never will be and working with the authorities is the best chance weve got to prevent any harm being brought against any children
8567032 the best way of achieving our aims now is to try and understand the law better and work within the law to move forward
8567033 this case doesnt set a precedent this case was decided on its own facts but what the case does show is that any practice which exposes children to harm will be subject of a crown prosecution service decision
8567034 the cps and prosecuting counsel andrew nuttall have always been at pains so say that this isnt an attack on shia practices the crux of the issue is the victims age and the prosecution was brought on the basis that an adult cant cause a child to be harmed or expose a child to harm under british law
8567035 when i got there i knew shane wasnt going to live
8567036 ive been told that he was thrown about like a rag doll
8567037 next time it could be a child there are children who play there
8567038 it came out of nowhere he was growling and looked like he was ready to go for me but then it dived for shane
8567039 there was no way i could get it loose it was just like a horror movie
8567040 it was snarling and everything if i had been able to pick up shane i think it would have gone for my legs there was nothing i could do

8567046 following a recent visit by prof brendan drumm to st johns i understand that the hse intends to downgrade the a amp e service to st johns by removing all emergency services and cover to limerick regional hospital this will remove a crucial medical service from the centre of the city and foist it on to an already overstretched a amp e department at limerick regional
8567047 st johns is the only city centre based hospital in limerick any downgrading of it will clearly affect patient care in the mid west minister harney and prof drumm must end the uncertainty by immediately confirming that the current level of a amp e services at the hospital will be maintained into the future
8567048 the figures may be an indication that the falling mortality rates from cardiovascular disease are beginning to reverse
8567049 this is a historic milestone for the company and the culmination of processes started many years ago today heralds a significant achievement by the company as it reaches a key empowerment objective at the equity level
8567050 we set out to ensure that the structure of the deal was as broad based as possible benefiting mainly black south african stakeholders
8567051 at least 85 of the benefits from both external and internal trusts will be allocated to black people
8567052 the strategic black partners were chosen because of their experience and involvement in the wider construction and mining arena and their ability to add value to ppc
8567053 most of them have broad based black components such as black women and youth among their stakeholders
8567054 empowerment and transformation is at the heart of ppc and this is a significant stride towards broad based equity ownership
8567055 today is not the end of a process but the dawn of a new chapter in ppcs 116 year history
8567056 je moet niet alleen rekening houden met de militaire kanten aan de missie maar ook met non profitorganisaties de lokale economie en het leven van de burgers we proberen dichter bij de mensen te komen we bewaren samen de vrede
8567057 however i do not agree with your milans purchase i dont like soups re heated
8567058 the defeat did highlight that we need a lot more strength in depth and hopefully that will come before september 1st
8567059 it has surprised everyone in the squad here for us aduriz was an important player but he is no longer playing for us and there are people here ready to take his place
8567060 these are things that happen in football and we cannot think about them for too long
8567061 i feel confident i know that i am capable of scoring goals and having a good year and i want to start this term in the same form that i ended the last one in
8567062 ive always respected ranieri i like him very much as a manager and juventus is a great club they are a big club who you would hope to miss out on but we have missed italian clubs a lot over the last few years and i have a feeling we will get an italian club at some stage and it might be one of our ex managers
8567063 but i think we should get through to the second stage regardless of seedings
8567064 fiorentina announce that the contract of defender alessandro gamberini has been renewed lasting until 2013
8567065 the player will meet with journalists at the stadio franchi today at 16 30 cet
8567066 from our point of view we know exactly what we have to do we have to win the game
8567067 its an easy game from that position because we dont have to worry about anything else the key is that we play well and win so its a straightforward exercise for us
8567068 it was a difficult evening the important thing from our point of view is making sure we start better than we did in the last game
8567069 if we do that and if we score then maybe midtjylland will become a little bit anxious and we will capitalise on that
8567070 he trained yesterday for the first time back with the group
8567071 he looked sharp like he had enjoyed the olympic experience and we hope to tap into that
8567072 we had a glimpse of him before he left for the olympics so it was obviously frustrating from our point of view that we havent been able to have him available up until now
8567073 but hes a good player an exceptionally talented young man and hes a good option for us
8567074 he gives us more presence than maybe we had in the first game
8567075 he was with the physios yesterday and obviously went through all the tests he needed to do to ensure that hell be available
8567076 he is the most complete boss that i have ever had both on and off the pitch
8567077 he pays attention to every detail and you can see the difference immediately there is a new spirit the squad has more belief and we are ready to control games
8567078 i cant say that it is completely healed but i am already able to play a game every three days
8567079 the only true thing that i know is that the player is staying with the yellow submarines
8567080 nothing else that has been said can be proven but i am not one to look back and go into it all everyone can say what they want but i always stick with what i know
8567081 it is is evident to me that what calder n said is not the case but that is all i want to say but i know that cazorla had no contact with madrid
8567082 we are ever confident that it will get done but we have always said it will go to the wire
8567083 we will keep moving it on and we hope that he will be joining us here at chelsea there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8567084 he doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8567085 were obviously keen to bring him to the club if we can
8567086 if the opportunity presents itself well try to pursue it but were not further down the road as yet the situation before we flew was the same it may have moved forward or it may have gone backwards but until i put the call in i wont know
8567087 we are looking for a run in this competition and that will obviously mean a lot more games this season thats why were trying to build a squad that would be able to cope with that
8567088 if you look at a side in many ways similar to ourselves last season everton i dont think they would have been able to cope with the size of the squad that we had last year certainly if wed been in evertons position with a run in europe it would have been an impossibility to have done that
8567089 now were trying to get a bit stronger both numerically but more importantly in terms of a bit of quality so that from a thursday to a sunday we are able to go into major games looking quite strong
8567090 that is something you could do with the best will in the world we could feel quite strong next monday and feel weve done our utmost and still end up in the scenario that west ham had last year the number of injuries they sustained would have been hard for anybody to have kept going
8567091 that can happen to the best of teams but you want to try and make as much provision as you can and thats what the last few days of the window are about in terms of looking to try and strengthen
8567092 if we can get through this game weve still got a big tie over two legs before the group stages the group stages are something that will take a bit of pressure off in terms of three sides from five qualifying and would guarantee european football up to and around christmas
8567093 they are here but that is all you can say about them
8567094 dazu haben wir am mittelsteg des aufliegers spezielle haken angebracht die sich bei der beladung fest mit den bodenrahmen der flaschenb ndeln oder der gitterboxen verbinden die haken wiederum sind direkt mit der bremsanlage verbunden nur wenn alle haken vollst ndig arretiert sind kann der fahrer losfahren
8567095 madrid has every right to make us an offer up until the final day of the transfer window but i have not liked the way they have done things
8567096 this is a clear message to the world of football and the major clubs out there that valencia will not be intimidated by anyone and that we are ready to press on with our plans
8567097 valencia and david villa are going to be together for many years and for me it is an honour that the best forward in europe is staying with us
8567098 above all the words there ar facts we are working on a sporting project with faith and determination and we need credibility and ambition

8567110 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
8567111 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
8567112 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen
8567113 we have seen the destruction of civilian infrastructure as well as calls by some russian politicians to change the democratically elected government of georgia some question the territorial integrity of georgia that is why we believe that russia has gone too far
8567114 but american investors are now looking at the situation around russia with concern and asking questions
8567115 we blame georgia and america for the war its the second time theyve bombed us we cant bear it anymore no one can guarantee that georgia wont bomb us again
8567116 independence would be good in theory but we cannot defend ourselves against georgia so we need to be part of russia if russia didnt support us then there would probably be no us left on this earth
8567117 after all weve gone through i dont want to go back to tskhinvali words cannot describe the five days we spent hiding in our basement scared for our lives i am haunted by those memories
8567118 im doing my best to take care of them i feel so sorry for them they arrived here with nothing and needed a roof over their heads
8567119 i know that human rights were violated during the conflict
8567120 i am only here to look at the human rights situation and come up with recommendations on how these rights can be protected in the future our report will be objective and impartial
8567121 many people had their rights violated including the primary right to life to housing and so on and this issue requires much attention so weve come to find out what happened from that perspective
8567122 we turned it into a tricky cup tie with macclesfield scoring early and them getting behind the ball and asking us to break them down
8567123 it got more and more frustrating for everybody but i was confident we were going to get back into it it was just a question of when but it dragged on a bit
8567124 i had a decision to make i put a couple of kids out there because i thought it was the right time

8567128 being able to extend the shelf life of fresh produce even for just two or three days is extremely valuable not only for producers retailers and consumers but also for the environment
8567129 the advances we have achieved in polymer technology by developing propafresh p2g amp p2gaf mean we are able to work with the majority of players in the fruit and vegetable arena to ensure the absolute optimum in pack conditions for their products
8567130 delivering improved shelf life is also key to reducing food waste and fits in with the waste amp resources action programme wrap s love food hate waste campaign which recommends consumers keep prepared fresh produce in the original packaging and refrigerate

8567132 because when there is some problem occurred in the software or hardware at some critical moments fingers always pointed out towards it and people think that they it must have done something wrong which might be not the case and people think that being in it they are doing nothing
8567133 so its better to ask the person who worked on them by creating awareness about it amongst the people of your organization and around your peer network
8567134 to any one like that because all of them have priorities and workload so we have to tackle them with tips and tricks likes off on which position the user is and how much work load it have

8567145 the staff were walking into the shop when two men pushed their way in the owner saw that one of them had a firearm and drew his weapon the suspect shot at the man and the owner shot back the robber was killed and the owner was shot in the hand and in the chest
8567146 i saw a man run out of the shop and down the road
8567147 he was in a critical condition and was taken to hospital but died shortly after arrival the suspected robber was declared dead at the store
8567148 he was the type of person that would never have hurt anyone he was a gentleman who was loved by all
8567149 he would not have normally done anything but this is the third time his store has been robbed and in the last two robberies they took everything i think he had had enough
8567150 my father had that store in victoria street for 28 years we were concerned about his safety because of the location of the store but he insisted that he wanted to be there
8567151 the defence team will be relying on various experts to assist in the defence of my clients for which funds are required

8567153 right guys this is how we are really going to play
8567154 there are too many forwards standing around in the backline
8567155 they try to do half of what we did and half of their own thing half of everything leaves you with nothing

8567160 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt suit these players

8567162 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8567163 the sco states welcome the adoption in moscow on august 12 of six principles of settling the conflict in south ossetia and support russias active role in contributing to peace and co operation in the region
8567164 we are thankful for your understanding and an objective assessment of russias peacemaking efforts
8567165 we are sure that the position of sco members will get an appropriate international response i hope it will serve as a serious signal for those who try to justify the bloody adventure of the georgian leadership
8567166 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8567167 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8567168 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8567169 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8567170 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8567171 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8567172 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8567173 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8567174 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8567175 fails to address in any manner the statutory criteria for a grant of forbearance
8567176 rather than expend the commissions limited resources on such a thinly supported petition
8567177 perhaps the commission should have dismissed the petition as deficient when it was first filed
8567178 although orbitcom does not provide any information about any of its rates we assume that it is requesting forbearance from these rules because its intrastate rates are higher than its interstate rates
8567179 the commission is now in the unfortunate position of having to either grant or deny the forbearance petition despite the lack of information to take no action would result in the petition being deemed granted
8567180 these are the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time
8567181 armed gangs of vhp bjp and bajrang dal hooligans are roaming throughout the districts indulging in a spree of arson and loot demolishing scores of churches vandalising schools orphanages run by missions and burning alive members of the christian community

8567187 i had lost all hope my family has come out of jaws of death
8567188 we prayed to thank god for giving us a second life on thursday
8567189 as we tried to convey to the security forces the whereabouts of the militants they tried to break the door but i resisted they then opened fire
8567190 i had given up i am with my children due to the efforts of the army and i will remain obliged to them for ever
8567191 woh hamein marne ke liye bolte the aur chup karne ke liye thapad bhi martay the they threatened to kill us and even slapped us telling us to remain quiet
8567192 we had locked ourselves in the kitchen to escape from the militants but they broke the door and brought us out
8567193 we pleaded with them not to kill us and offered them belongings and cash we asked them to spare as as we have small children they locked all of us except my husband who they kept separately in a room
8567194 it was a very sensitive but successful operation we were able to save the family particularly women and children
8567195 unfortunately we lost three hostages to the bullets of the militants
8567196 they came unscathed from this house of death due to the blessing of the god
8567197 the people of entire colony had prayed for their well being during the operation
8567198 the countries of east asia are important drivers of growth with large consumption to drive global economies

8567221 ive been doing the job nine years i actually dont think anyone should do more than 10 years running a business
8567222 surprised to see the ceo who we regard highly stepping down later this year
8567223 he started speaking and it was amazing it was transformed from a type of perhaps festival atmosphere to almost religious
8567224 when i think of doing good things such as charity i think that is a result of the ideas that dr king had
8567225 every parent or especially a mother wants the world and the country to be as good as it can be
8567226 but i had no idea it was going to have the impact that it did have
8567227 i served real well and thats going to be key at this tournament
8567228 its ok its going to be good in two days im sure after that happened i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal but in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle but its going to be all right
8567229 i played good for the first round because im always nervous and my confidence is not so great just in the beginning of tournaments
8567230 but i played good in all three sets i was fighting good and i had very good concentration
8567231 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is underway against all 18 individuals
8567232 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8567233 these results must be understood in context tests show that drug misuse is almost 20 times more common in civilian work places than it is in the navy positive test rates in the navy last year averaged less than 0 4 per cent compared with over 7 per cent in civilian workplaces
8567234 we are not complacent though and our compulsory drug tests will continue to expose those few that let the rest down
8567235 the uk ministry of defence conducts europes largest compulsory drug testing programme and this has significantly reduced drug misuse among service personnel
8567236 the worst aspect of this scandal is that hms liverpool is supposed to be guarding the falkland islands and such a large drugs bust hardly does wonders for confidence
8567237 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8567238 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8567239 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8567240 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
8567241 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights

8567243 isaiah berlin once did a valuable service to the cause of liberty he wrote a rather muddled book that discussed the difference between positive liberty and negative liberty people are familiar with negative liberty it is the eave me alone liberty that forms the cross axis of the nolan chart stretching from statist to libertarian what is less familiar to most people is positive liberty which is the liberty of having a voice in government be it the ability to vote to create and implement ballot initiatives or to run for office this is an important distinction because occasionally these two come into conflict when the come into conflict the libertarian believes that negative liberty must win while the democratic statist believes that positive liberty must win

8567292 to be honest with the people im going to work for
8567293 alleen doet hij het voor 83 000 mensen in een stadion in denver en ik in de koninklijke schouwburg in den haag
8567294 dat manifest koos concreet positie op enkele themas die later werden uitgewerkt in het verkiezingsprogramma maar deze beginselverklaring geeft een grondtoon de kern waar wij voor staan
8567295 een belangrijk deel van de liberale kernwaarden blijft natuurlijk overeind maar de mondiale ontwikkelingen gaan razendsnel en daar moet je je als partij op blijven aanpassen het stuk met de beginselen uit 1980 is verouderd er staan van die joop den uyl termen in als sociale markteconomie en het belang van concurrentie ontbreekt zelfs helemaal dus dat moest echt moderner worden
8567296 toen ik deze beginselverklaring schreef werd ik geconfronteerd met groot onbehagen in de nederlandse samenleving over concrete themas als zorgen over de globalisering over de nog steeds grote instroom van kansarme immigranten of over het feit dat veel mensen in de gezondheidszorg het onderwijs en bij de politie door bureaucratie hun vak zijn kwijtgeraakt maar er is ook een laag dieper een enorm wantrouwen in de staat en de politiek zelf dat komt omdat er te veel is beloofd en te weinig geleverd er is een pretentie geschapen alsof de staat verantwoordelijk is voor jouw en mijn geluk alsof er een samenleving mogelijk zou zijn met nul risico het leidt tot een duffer nederland en de terreur van de middelmaat daar moeten we vanaf
8567297 natuurlijk ook wij zijn er wel eens in meegegaan toen er in utrecht een houten trap instortte omdat er te veel mensen op stonden waren er k vvders die riepen om een commissie en een onderzoek net als toen de vierdaagse in nijmegen geteisterd werd door de hitte en er vele mensen het slachtoffer werden alsof er een soort risicoloze samenleving te vergeven is misschien moet je geen vierdaagse lopen als het heet is en je een hartkwaal hebt en als er 200 mensen op een houten trap gaan staan dan kan het gebeuren dat dat ding instort daar is de staat niet verantwoordelijk voor
8567298 zeker we hebben de schadelijke schaalvergroting niet tegengehouden en met het milieu een van de andere grote vraagstukken van deze tijd hadden we veel meer het maatschappelijk debat moeten domineren dat gaan we nu dus doen met pleidooien voor hoogwaardig onderwijs in een kleinschalige omgeving geen betuttelend groenlinks geleuter dat je niet in een grote auto mag rijden maar ruimte voor innovatieve initiatieven die er echt toe doen
8567299 de staat moet klein en krachtig zijn geen geluksmachine die mensen hun hele leven uit handen neemt mensen moeten met verve kunnen leven ruimte krijgen om iets buitengewoons te maken van hun leven de vvd strijdt voor verheffing van de onderklasse door goed onderwijs willen we mensen op eigen benen laten staan het geluk zit in de mens niet in de staat
8567300 haha dat heb ik expres gedaan beetje provoceren ik wil dat pvdaers denken h gaan ze er met mijn vlag vandoor ja inderdaad zeg ik dan want jullie hebben die verspeeld
8567301 het is z r liberaal om grenzen te stellen ik wil geen xenofobe angst voor alles wat van buiten komt maar je moet wel durven zeggen deze beschavingsfundamenten de taal de grondwet en de vaderlandse geschiedenis dat is van ons en vanuit daar gaan we verder dan kan je als succesvol immigrant in nederland gewoon minister of staatssecretaris worden
8567302 absoluut het is een persoonlijk statement geworden waarom ik de politiek in ben gegaan en het is de uitwerking van het verhaal waarop ik tot leider ben gekozen
8567303 zeker de rode draad van deze beginselverklaring leeft breed in de vvd
8567304 dat is niet het doel op zichzelf maar ik wil de vvd wel weer offensief neerzetten dat van die trap in utrecht of van die avondvierdaagse dat lijken klein voorbeeldjes maar het is wel tekenend omdat het aangeeft dat we als vvd moeten durven dat we niet meteen in reflexen schieten dat we zeggen waar het op staat wat mensen hun eigen rol is hoe ze zelf initiatief kunnen nemen en we moeten daarvoor de gelegenheden bieden deze beginselverklaring is vooral een opdracht aan onszelf
8567305 really wanted to capture the heart and soul of detroit

8567308 foreign police officers are formally provided policing status if they are to be exercising policing powers in canada
8567309 troopers were involved in both stops of the motorist in question
8567310 texas state troopers were engaged in direct policing contrary to rcmp policy
8567311 we all know that a police officer from outside the country doesnt have the powers of a peace officer here in b c
8567312 we had concerns about what are texas rangers doing stopping cars and engaging in active law enforcement in canada
8567313 unfortunately though the commission substantiated a lot of our complaint it didnt go that far as to say its bad policy for the rcmp to use foreign officers to enforce the law in canada
8567314 the delay was in excess of 18 months for a file in which the commissioner was in almost complete agreement

8567321 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8567322 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8567595 only study bible that presents the text of the new king james version in chronological order
8567596 we understand more deeply what scholars and historians know of the earliest peoples
8567597 it bothers me when bad historical criticism trumps narrative structure
8567598 it s primarily a set of theological texts that have historical significance not a set of historical texts that have theological significance
8567599 removes the significance of the authorship through that process of transmission
8567600 i do think you do lose something when you start demolishing any book of the bible
8567601 looking through the eyes of someone who has had trouble understanding the bible this could be a refreshing alternative
8567602 the goal of the chronological study bible is not to replace the time honored canonical arrangement but instead to honor time as the setting in which the biblical record appeared readers who study this bible will return to their traditional in canonical order bibles better equipped to read them

8567607 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8567608 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8567610 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8567611 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8567612 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8567613 now he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8567614 the four suspects were arrested on a single flight based on our profiling and other risk assessment screening factors

8567617 obviously no one knows whats happening to exchange rates oil prices consumer confidence around the world
8567618 inevitably the companys outlook for 2009 is rather less bullish and the ongoing rise in commodity costs could yet erode some of its operating margins

8567630 legal aid officers over the years have had to cope regrettably with the restriction watching helplessly how indigent offenders of the law suffer deprivation however legal officers are now hopeful that with the proposed bill before the national assembly everybody will be allowed to engage the services of the legal aid council
8567631 i particularly called for this interactive session to enable me meet and know each of you one on one and then to remind ourselves of the great need to stand up and do what we are called to do and also chart a way forward for future responsibilities that may be unavoidable
8567632 i know our council is lacking in so many things including training however i am looking at the need for us as legal aid officers to begin to attend training with other professionals to develop our versatility as compared to what presently obtain where our trainings are sponsored by donors who alone determine the terms of attendance where and when
8567633 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside we are not making any comment on speculation
8567634 when i got home and i saw a neighbour come across with her husband i was gripped with dread i couldnt believe what she was telling me the police called later and said they still dont know where the family are
8567635 i think rivers state is taking good care of itself just like i said at the dinner the picture that is being depicted in newspapers about what is happening in rivers state is different from what i in the two days i have been here have experienced
8567636 the kidnapping of an israeli tuesday night in port harcourt is a calculated attempt to embarrass the government and people of rivers state
8567637 the kidnapping done at a time the israeli ambassador was visiting rivers state is a failed attempt to make rivers state look unsafe to the israeli envoy and the potential israeli investors he came with
8567638 however the government and people of rivers state cannot be cowed by this act of criminality the government and security forces are on top of the situation
8567639 we have come on a fact finding mission myself and some israeli businessmen on various aspects like agriculture security education and telecommunications we met with the government and the private sector too
8567640 i think a lot more could be being done as opposed to just a hard edged enforcement around stop and search
8567641 were seeing a number of guys committing the murders are already marginalised already excluded and we are trying those kind of tactics on those individuals i fear we just make the problem worse
8567642 stop and search is a vital tool against knife crime it has been a key part of blunt 2
8567643 there were 1 592 arrests during that period for possession of knives and other weapons as a result of that 1 445 knives are off the streets
8567644 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts
8567645 we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside we are not making any comment on speculation
8567646 when i saw chris a few days ago he seemed happy but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch
8567647 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead
8567648 they wont be able to go into the house for a couple of days because its unsafe due to the extent of the fire the waiting is killing me
8567649 it is very very weird we have not heard anything we dont know whether they were in there or not

8567766 given the price of gasoline and the economic situation it is quite difficult to imagine a dramatic improvement in the japanese market
8567767 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth
8567768 we must ensure that the market does not shrink as a result of price hikes therefore we have decided to limit the number of models that would be affected

8567771 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is underway against all 18 individuals
8567772 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8567773 the worst aspect of this scandal is that hms liverpool is supposed to be guarding the falkland islands and such a large drugs bust hardly does wonders for confidence
8567774 these results must be understood in context tests show that drug misuse is almost 20 times more common in civilian workplaces than it is in the navy positive test rates in the navy last year averaged less than 0 4 compared with over 7 in civilian workplaces
8567775 the uk ministry of defence conducts europes largest compulsory drug testing programme and this has significantly reduced drug misuse among service personnel
8567776 we are not complacent though and our compulsory drug tests will continue to expose those few that let the rest down

8567781 murrysville has the best storm water runoff ordinances in the entire county
8567782 were not only concerned about flooding export were concerned about flooding our own community
8567783 the reality of the situation is you dont have good baseline data for the pre development conditions
8567784 as near as i can tell theres no municipality in the state that has good baseline data for what these pre development conditions truly are
8567785 were really trying to focus on revitalizing our downtown business district and thats going to be hard to do with big box stores and chain stores
8567786 and theres nothing theyre going to put in there thats going to hurt export
8567787 i feel a fair bipartisan process by this board found a manager who possesses the credentials and experience necessary to meet the growing demands of our rapidly growing municipality
8567788 jim morrisons mandate is to keep our municipality moving forward efficiently
8567789 north huntingdon has similar challenges i feel that murrysville faced when i worked there
8567790 its a really good progressive community with many opportunities my job will be to make sure those opportunities are not wasted
8567791 include working with people and developing a team with everybody pulling in the same direction that includes the commissioners administration staff and appointed boards
8567792 im fortunate to be joining a dedicated proven administrative staff
8567793 what theyve accomplished to make north huntingdon a desirable community to live in and one of the fastest growing municipalities in western pennsylvania i feel speaks for itself ill be depending on them
8567794 my plan is to ask everybody what are your goals and what direction do you want to take to accomplish them i will listen when residents speak out because they also have stake in the townships future
8567795 the gateway school district is very pleased that we have reached what we consider a contract which meets the needs of both sides and will continue to keep the mission of gateway school district at the core as we continue to serve the educational needs of our 4 300 students

8567798 i said yes and accepted them i thanked her she nodded smiled and left the building her good deed for the day was done i guess
8567799 i couldnt help wondering though how did members of that church know our organization didnt have animal oxygen masks these masks will hook into oxygen bottles our ambulances carry
8567800 really weve answered emergency distress calls for dogs cats and even cattle we used oxygen masks designed for humans
8567801 once our unit got a frantic call that a male was in cardiac arrest thats all the dispatcher said our crew got there and found a crowd looking at a dog lying on the ground the animal was pretty far gone we tried to bring it back it died
8567802 maybe if we had an animal mask the result might have been happier
8567803 in this business you never know what youre going to face when youre called out now were prepared for anything even dogs
8567804 i needed to be certified in north huntingdon because of the township police k 9 units dogs
8567805 we just figured with the increase in boat traffic every year our 16 foot aluminum was not up to snuff

8567808 with this one theres too much potential that people will get hurt
8567809 he sang he danced he acted he was phenomenally talented
8567810 what i respect about him is that he still credits his parents and teachers for his success
8567811 i guess my mom saw some musical talent in me
8567812 his advice was to do as much as i can until i cant anymore
8567813 everyone from mike myers on down was so approachable and it was the catalyst for a great learning experience
8567814 you could argue that daniel day lewis in there will be blood is an example of cross cultural casting

8567818 if you want to be the star football player this is not the school for you
8567819 this is for students and families who want something different
8567820 i like to donate the money because it will help make my brother happy
8567821 you can tell that raeann really loves and cares about her brother
8567822 shes constantly ahead of him knowing what he wants she is a kind hearted little girl
8567823 people know that the bracelets are for a good cause and they appeal to a lot of people who can personally relate to them
8567824 raeann can make them by request too and you usually have them the next day thats how quick she is
8567825 i have remembrance bracelets autism ones and i have bought birthstone bracelets for my daughters
8567826 there are even quite a few that i have given as gifts
8567827 its nice to have something like this all of her bracelets are displayed here with little cards saying what each bracelet is explaining the meanings of the colored beads
8567828 there is an estranged relationship with law enforcement and the african american community not just in swissvale but throughout the country
8567829 were not here today to say all law enforcement officers are bad people but we need to look at the system
8567830 ever since i was a kid ive seen all of my black friends being put down on the ground and being chased by the police
8567831 some cops are good cops but on the same note there are rotten cops
8567832 if were going to build good relationships police cant bash youth and youth cant bash police
8567833 i grew up in swissvale and the police were more community oriented then
8567834 this is a first step in the right direction but there need to be more talks like this with the swissvale police department present
8567835 i may be naive but i dont think police go out and say i want to go kill someone to day
8567836 if you go to council meetings you would not believe the rapport you develop with council members and police

8567840 actually there is no location set yet where the ramp extension would access pennsylvania avenue the study should determine a recommendation
8567841 that study is linked to the proposed turnpike extension feasibility study
8567842 we approached penndot about doing the project they showed interest but would not pay for a feasibility study
8567843 a turnpike exit ramp accessing pennsylvania avenue definitely would impact traffic flowing through irwin motorists use main street and oak street as shortcuts to avoid route 30 traffic congestion to reach north irwin trafford route 993 and penn township
8567844 were thinking speed bumps and stop signs to slow traffic thats not enough to slow down the volume of traffic that would be generated by an extension its going to be a nightmare for our residents
8567845 the study should include recommendations to reduce traffic congestion on all roads in that area
8567846 i feel an extension of the west exit ramp would reduce turnpike traffic trying to access route 30 the traffic gridlock at rush hour is terrible and its getting worse
8567847 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case

8567859 i would caution the statistic which highlights a 24 increase in deaths due to terrorism it is not clear from the newspaper article how this relates to tourism however the fact that this article raises a call for terrorism exclusion clauses to be scrapped is an interesting point perhaps the time has now come for a mature debate on the issue of official travel advices vs unofficial travel advices and how this relates to the risk destination and travel insurance for the holidaymaker

8567877 despite increased competition and market fragmentation we expect red hat and novell to continue to lead the enterprise linux market
8567878 but it is unclear whether they truly appreciate the impact of community linux distributions on their overall growth opportunities
8567879 based on their sometimes half hearted commitment to their own respective community editions fedora and opensuse and the somewhat disappointing developer mind share that both command it seems red hat and novell may not fully recognize the trend that we see growing over time

8567919 kickoff return for example some teams use a three man wedge and some teams use a four man wedge a lot of that has to do with your returner and the kinds of schemes you run off that
8567920 a lot of four man wedge teams are clearly a middle wedge and outside directional wedge concept where its more of a downhill running back who breaks tackles a three man wedge is a little more versatile where you can set double teams at the point of attack

8567927 we just keep it moving as much as we can
8567928 you can still pay attention while youre doing something else other than just sitting there and dreaming about motorcycles or something
8567929 every now and then you kind of get heavy eyed a little bit
8567930 and its getting closer to the game maybe thats why thursday is so long
8567931 then someones going to key on it so i have to change things up show people different things and mess around with stuff i think that is the difference between a guy with experience and a guy without experience
8567932 i pretty much know where im going to be so i can mess with a guy
8567933 i can take a chance on a guy and get in his face if a guys winded i know i can get up and grab a hold of him because hes not going to be able to run around me youve got to be able to key off all that stuff even to the point where youre reading safeties and know if a guy is going to slam across your face youre taking chances but theyre all calculated
8567934 im always getting coached and then its about accepting the coaching and trying to put it into my game to make it better
8567935 thats a game where we did quite a bit of different stuff because we felt we had to
8567936 and we still made some mistakes in that game you have to watch how much you put in because youre vulnerable to mistakes but for the most part we felt we did a pretty good job
8567937 we felt good because youre going up against a good team
8567938 theres something to saying hey break their undefeated season its a challenge and we can do this
8567939 i strive for the huddle to be very relaxed and everyone focused on me
8567940 it has been that way if things go wrong if you have a dropped ball or a fumble and we recover you want guys to come back to the huddle and say hey you know what guys my fault ill get the next one
8567941 when you get that it reassures confidence in everyone else im not here yelling at everyone my job is to provide confidence i tell guys im coming right back to them and i need them
8567942 if you can get the feeling of youre up 21 youre going to play a lot better when you start thinking about stuff and worrying about stuff that messes your game up and slows you down a little bit it comes from experience but you have to be able to be in that situation where this is no problem were just going to roll down the field and get where we have to get
8567943 hes the president of the group he gets us in the positions we need to be in hes real loose and i like that about donovan hes not so uptight in the huddle that affects everybody when the person leading is relaxed and confident then everyone else is going to feel that and try to display that same attribute that he has

8567973 and sending it to earthtenders composting facility in farmington new hampshire where it will be made into organic compost
8567974 is that in these difficult times how can we not do whatever we can to conserve resources it used to be considered patriotic to conserve and recycle everything now were told were told were not patriotic if we dont consume

8567982 lots of people think they dont have the ability to engineer change
8567983 they can they can become empowered by just using compostable cups and so on all the little things really add up
8567984 for example our customers can bring their own mugs and get coffee for 1 we can do this because they bring their own mugs and no waste products are involved this sounds small but it really isnt small at all
8567985 i really hope to able to get other local business in on this project

8567990 los venezolanos no podemos permitir que ch vez se burle una vez m s del pueblo venezolano que de manera categ rica le dijo no a su proyecto pol tico el pasado 2 de diciembre ch vez debe entender que los venezolanos queremos vivir en paz y tranquilidad que apostamos a la reconciliaci n y al reencuentro entre todos los ciudadanos que estamos hartos de la constante conflictividad pol tica adem s que no toleraremos que sea desconocida la voluntad mayoritaria que anhela vivir en el marco de la pluralidad democr tica que a el tanta fobia al parecer le provoca el presidente ch vez lo que debe es ponerse a gobernar y a solucionar los innumerables problemas que tenemos en el pa s y dejar de una vez por todas a un lado su fantasioso sue o de perpetuarse a como de lugar en el poder
8567991 is any thought or behavior that can be passed from one person to another by means of imitation
8567992 this is our only fundraiser and we do it very well
8567993 it doesnt cover all the museums costs but last year we made over 72 000 dollars and for a small museum like the omaa that is a significant amount
8567994 the participating artists are very generous and we are extremely grateful to them
8567995 i think this indicates their dedication to the omaa and their support of all that we do in the way of exhibitions and programs

8568001 i had found something that i had fun with and i was good at
8568002 the start and finish is right in market square so its a long rectangle right through downtown
8568003 each lap takes only two to three minutes to do so its a good race for spectators its not more than every few minutes before you see us go by again
8568004 the whole pretense of the event is promoting a healthy lifestyle and getting families together
8568005 its a sporting event yes but we knew right away we couldnt close off the downtown streets without taking advantage of it and making this into a festival
8568006 if you started riding a road bike it will probably become sort of addictive
8568007 the best way to get into it is to go to a local shop and ask about rides in the area see what it is to go fast before you go to your first race
8568008 it doesnt matter how tired you are you dig as deep as you can when you have a community of 7 000 cheering you on
8568009 machine art the illusion of soul in the heart of automation

8568011 or where i first got the idea to start drawing them

8568013 the machines have grown into something much more than a doodle in math class

8568041 i grabbed him under his arms and lifted him high i hit his head on the washbasin and punched him in the stomach
8568042 the doctors report was devastating but i always thought if i knew exactly what transpired i could start to get on with my life
8568043 instead i wish i hadnt been there since the sentencing i have not had one good day
8568044 on the day of sentencing i told her everything what makes it worse is that people in the community speak openly about what her father did
8568045 i thought i had a husband but didnt see the real side of him so many things came out in court that i was not aware of
8568046 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
8568047 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites

8568053 i never knew what they were talking about from the minute we met
8568054 its all on the company lewis is going to take you to some pretty fancy places and he wants you to feel comfortable and for that matter
8568055 im just this close to going back to west virginia
8568056 if they want to spend money on us were gonna let them do it we already know what they think of us so well just take a deep breath and do what we have to do this afternoon and the rest of the week all right glenn
8568057 you shouldnt have invited them to stay here with us
8568058 it was obvious from the first moment that we had nothing to say to one another
8568059 well they seemed like very nice people in west virginia
8568060 thats their environment going to church and eating fried chicken and all the rest of it we dont have a porch here with any rocking chairs on it if they had stayed here we would have had to entertain them day and night until the end of the week theyll be fine at the plaza when were not doing something with them they can go sight seeing or whatever they want to do
8568061 when theyre not with us theyre going to sit around and watch television and order room service
8568062 you can wear a different tie every night with a different shirt and make these two suits look like new outfits as long as youre in the city but those shoes
8568063 wont work with these suits theyre too over the top what you need is a plain black gucci loafer that you can wear every night get some black silk stockings to go with them stockings without patterns
8568064 i could never wear something like this in west virginia
8568065 daniel will be glad to get these theyre just his style
8568066 i think the colors are crazy in the other three one of them mixes blue and green and red and yellow and one of them has squares i can wear them to permons
8568067 mom would you trade places with me so that i can watch the view
8568068 dorothy has a thing about heights they make her dizzy
8568069 what you need to hunt qual is a good birddog
8568070 betty you dont seem to understand whats going on im not auditioning glenn reeves this week hes auditioning me hes a non commodity as far as im concerned and he has money written all over him hes the man i need to do what i want to do but its possible that hes too innocent in his own way to realize that hes holding most of the cards in this deal all i have to offer him is money anyone can give him money but his expertise holds the key to what im trying to do
8568071 the first day with the reeves has been trying they didnt like the food at windows on the world can you believe it
8568072 i really like your idea or your proposal or your plan but dorothy is dead set against it and you know how stubborn she is when she makes up her mind
8568073 rabbi volkman is rabbi of temple israel in charleston one of the oldest reform congregations in america
8568074 you see theres a special irony in our location were on the site of john jacob astors mansion you know who i mean
8568075 beyond his wealth he is best know for going down with the titanic
8568076 the rabbi began to stroll toward the beama as he continued on
8568077 and we went to the touro synagogue my mothers family is descended from those jews up there
8568078 the summer i lived in st louis i was sixteen but im a baptist now and so is glenn
8568079 when gracie mansion was built it was five miles north of the city there were no roads it was only reachable by boat
8568080 when i was a kid men around here still wore dirndels and lederhosen
8568081 this is where geoffery bradfield lives bettys obsessed with having him re do our apartment she says that before long all his clients will be billionaires
8568082 i think your apartment is beautiful the way it is
8568083 but betty wants to make a statement she wants to have people over and blow them away
8568084 but i did take them to the apartments on gerard avenue where the back rooftops overlook yankee stadium i was only up there a couple of times as a teenager but it was great watching the ballgames for free one of the guys who lived there had actually seen the joe louis max schmeling fight he had a pair of binoculars and claimed he saw the sweat fly off of schmelings face when louis knocked him out
8568085 sounded just like the guy on the ferry boat in nashville
8568086 well he probably takes a lot of people on the same little tour he gave us today didnt he say there were japanese in town two weeks ago
8568087 they bring over lots of german investors ill bet he takes them to the heidellberg
8568088 betty adores it tonight were going to see a balanchine ballet
8568089 he was a russian choreographer that came to the states and transformed american dance
8568090 raymonda choreography by balanchine music by glazunov starring rudolf nureyev and maria tallchief how will i describe this
8568091 just tell them the ballerina stood straight up on her toe with one leg and pointed the other leg straight up to the ceiling
8568092 you know i cant do this alone in new york city
8568093 and im spending my own money so let go of my elbow
8568094 we can get into any cab in this city tell them to take us to the plaza and were not lost any more
8568095 i have got to have him glenn ive got to have him
8568096 well buy one of those little carrying cages and take him back to the hotel
8568097 oh i dont want to ride that plane again it scared me to death we can rent a car and drive back home
8568098 itll take us two days to drive back to west virginia
8568099 well rent a car and buy a bunch of country and western cassettes and you wont even notice how long it takes we have to go through pennsylvania right
8568100 well we can stop at the howard johnsons we used to stop at the one with the stone building
8568101 but i must tell you we dont allow pets in our rooms
8568102 no matter if you leave him in a cage for your entire stay someone will call the spca and we certainly dont want them tramping through the lobby do we
8568103 perhaps you would care to take the animal back whence it came
8568104 i think instead well check out of here and find a hotel that will take a cat
8568105 well mr reeves arent you booked in here through the end of the week what i mean to say is the entire week must be paid for
8568106 as i understand it this is a company room they pay by the year dont they isnt it always reserved by the goodwyn brothers
8568107 well in that case well be checking out i have a nice tip for a bellboy to follow me up to the room and bring our luggage down
8568108 geeze its exactly like the one in fairmont west virginia
8568109 it was angelo in fairmont he probably came up here and decided he wanted to build one just like it
8568110 isnt that going to cause you problems with your diabetes
8568111 i havent had any real food since ive been here
8568112 bastille day the anniversary of the storming of the bastille
8568113 bastille day commemorates the beginning of the french revolution its similar to our fourth of july which was just a few days ago were headed to a restaurant called chez napol on which makes a big deal out of bastille day
8568114 is known as grand m re and she in turn was taught by her grandmother theres a love story behind this place the chef mrs bruno
8568115 helped a french prisoner alfred bruno escape from a nazi work camp they were subsequently married but there was no film for a photograph so their wedding picture could not be taken until later that year and it hangs just there
8568116 we know simon bessie albees original publisher simon and cornelia are friends
8568117 not so much of a genius that he let nabokov get away from him
8568118 george and his brother and his father and his family are rich because theyre very very sensible people his manner is down to earth and friendly and im sure youll like him
8568119 do i look stupid wearing something like this on a yacht
8568120 well i dont believe you can wear a white shirt alone youll have to wear a jacket with it
8568121 glenn id like to introduce you to george goodwyn of goodwyn brothers goodwyn brothers is our principal and here on my right is clarence ostendorf from the geology department at columbia
8568122 they have artichokes and shiitaki mushrooms and a powdered pineapple glaze i hope you enjoy them
8568123 glenn lewis here is of austrian heritage his family lived in vienna for hundreds of years and unlike most who fled the nazis they maintained ties to people in the german speaking countries
8568124 he spoke very highly of you we put together some figures and we found that you struck oil 83 of the time thats an incredible record
8568125 i never knew the figures i just relied on my gut i can bring in a well for one hundred fifty thousand dollars every time i know where the oil is
8568126 the money spends the same way whether its gut or geologist
8568127 you see glenn before we became presbyterians the goodwyns were german german jews so we arrived before ellis island was built
8568128 the germans were standing there offering sweatshop jobs to anyone who wanted them
8568129 we need a little meeting glenn so would you and dorothy mind taking a little stroll around the deck
8568130 these people came to new york and bought a cat
8568131 and they didnt care for ballet or a night of broadway drivel
8568132 you should have taken them to see the rockettes you should have taken them to the carnegie deli better yet lewis if you have the time you ought to run em down to the jersey shore go to the circus diner and get um some soft shell crabs theyd like that for christs sakes dont take them to the opera lewis this guys gonna make you a ton of money im in
8568133 theres another thing i never brought up when we were just talking its really about the future theres a formation called the marcellus shale a layer of rock under the entire state of pennsylvania a lot of new york and west virginia too this formation has lots of natural gas its kind of expensive to extract but if they can work out a way to get at it and theyre working on it in texas right now its worth billions
8568134 you see glenn this is ms corrections we had an investor from guildford just south of london and in his typical english way he referred to the charge of the light brigade as something by kipling no said ms corrections the charge of the light brigade was by tennyson tennyson preceded kipling and as if that wasnt enough she said tennyson followed byron well this guy is very embarrassed and he says kipling was born on the birthday of george the fifth and died on the day that george fifth died his face was all red with humiliation and i thought we had lost him thanks to ms corrections here
8568135 maybe well change the itinerary reggies having a cocktail party
8568136 stop right there first of all they dont drink second of all the last thing they need is a room full of new york posers they know real people
8568137 but lewis in new york we have world class posers especially reggie and wandas crowd
8568138 yes it is all those people with their mid atlantic accents you know the fake british inflection with the brooklyn pop ups
8568139 daniel wrote the camp david peace song went to israel and presented it to the prime minister there and went to egypt and presented it to president sadat
8568140 but he was one of my grandmothers favorite versifiers and she had this book
8568141 now i would guess that reba would be in her sixties i wonder if she could have imagined what the world would come to when she wrote this i mean hitler was an obscure man in prison i believe
8568142 i was reading sylvia plath before what a difference but what i wanted to say was i know george was right the reeves are out of sync
8568143 the problem is you my dear and your reverse provincialism
8568144 have you ever seen those maps that show everything on the other side of the hudson foreshortened i mean america is just a little peninsula of new york thats the way bi coastal people see it they get in a plane and fly over america when they arrive on the west coast all theyve seen is a five hour blur but if you get in a car and drive out to illinois and on to colorado youll realize what a vast country we have and its inhabited mostly by americans people like the reeves they dont give a damn about new york or l a theyve got their own thing and theyre in the majority the vast majority
8568145 oh lewis you turn me on when you get so exercised
8568146 whenever skies look grey to me whenever friends say youre through whenever the blues become my only song i concentrate on you
8568147 ill be in new york next week ill be in atlantic city next week ill be in vegas or whatever
8568148 i know from the way you say oh my that youre from illinois
8568149 bought you a fur coat for christmas and a diamond ring a big cadillac car and everything ah gee baby what else can i do ah gee baby aint i good to you
8568150 tonight wasnt so bad they loved bobby short im very curious about this daniel person i guess when all is said and done ive been a little bit of a snot nosed snob but lord knows i cant help myself
8568151 oh theyve got everything in there its burgers shakes pies cakes whatever you need
8568152 i guess they wanted to show us a good time
8568153 but they just didnt know how to do it one of these days ill run lewis to nashville and well have a good ol time or maybe take him to new orleans at mardi gras
8568154 glenn wasnt paying any attention to the dance at all he was just waiting for those moments when the ballerina had her legs spread apart
8568155 we dragged them up and down the streets to one cultural event after another george goodwyn saw it as clearly as night and day you should have taken them to see the rocketts he said his real meaning was that i was piling misery upon misery for these poor people
8568156 why come to new york if you dont see what new york has to offer
8568157 its too bad theyre not here tonight we could all go see the l elisir d amore
8568158 how could they hate it when the tenor sings una furtiva lagrima
8568159 the whole week when you really get down to it
8568160 apart from that my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8568161 will be positioned in their bases outside the cities and there will not be troops seen patrolling inside the city unless necessary
8568162 the province is ready for the handover the iraqi security forces are up to the job
8568163 as a father who has three children in the military i want peace for them
8568164 its a part of a national soap opera that has taken hold of israeli politics
8568165 there are those who say that if we are making peace better a general should do it than a woman
8568166 the european union has firmly condemned russias unilateral decision to recognize the independence of these two territories abkhazia and south ossetia this decision which presupposes a unilateral change to georgias borders is quite simply unacceptable
8568167 we are confident that the position of the sco member states will have a proper international resonance
8568168 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify the aggression that was committed
8568169 china expresses concern over the latest developments in the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
8568170 alleges that atrocities were meted out on the south ossetian population russia or south ossetia must document whether this is the case and to what extent
8568171 it is a great lineup of coaches the thing thats exciting too is that its a great players conference theyre the ones that play the game
8568172 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8568173 we wanted to refer him to a hospital in dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there so they took him home where he died
8568174 it was a very unusual case the boy had one body but two complete heads
8568175 siirtyminen hedge fund tyyppisest portfoliosta traditionaaliseen balansoitu portfolioon on hyv asia tehd
8568176 one of the fundamental principles of the bus is that there is no such thing as a dumb question
8568177 you think i could survive if i didnt wed never be forgiven id have to hire a food taster somebody to start my car in the morning
8568178 i wanted the case number but was told that the laptop had been reported lost not stolen so there was no case number
8568179 i had taken down the name of the suspect and even spoke to deputy minister gigaba who told me that he knew the man and was very upset about it
8568180 the person who went to danikass shop never worked for the department i do not want to speculate due processes will be followed
8568181 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8568182 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy

8568184 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8568185 our vehicles seemed to go largely unnoticed as there was much construction and rebuilding taking place
8568186 the requirement right now in iraq is much more about nation building than it is fighting
8568187 its our view that if theres a stiffer fight going on someplace else then thats where we need to be
8568188 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8568189 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8568190 its well known who helped georgian authorities and even encouraged them in pursuit of their own aims this is unacceptable and must end
8568191 there are also questions of socio economic cooperation particularly in the sectors of energy transport trade finance information technologies and agriculture on the agenda
8568192 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8568193 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8568194 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8568195 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8568196 twelve dead bodies of the insurgents were left on the battlefield
8568197 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8568198 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8568199 you can slow a picture down so much that you can see the grains of sand and the clay around the bag you can see whether or not a person has shaved that day
8568200 the commissioner has come around and hes embraced it because the technology is undeniable im sure there was a time when all of us watched baseball on black and white tvs now i bet you everybody in the room has a high def tv
8568201 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8568202 but we dont expect anybody is going to impact the game in that fashion if it were true that something like that did happen wed impact them very quickly from the commissioners office without a doubt but we dont have that fear not at all everybodys going to want to show the play
8568203 security forces killed 25 30 militants including some important commanders and foreigners in bajaurs raghan region
8568204 around 75 100 militants attacked a checkpost on the night of august 26 27 security forces effectively repulsed the attack reportedly 11 militants were killed and 15 20 others injured
8568205 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8568206 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8568207 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back tomorrow
8568208 when i walked into this clubhouse i remembered getting champagne poured on me right over there about 20 feet away and i got a smile on my face because it just has a good memory to me
8568209 and i know this is the last year of the stadium so you think about that
8568210 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career
8568211 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankee series for me
8568212 im not writing a hall of fame career just yet but its been nice to get off to the start ive gotten off to it takes a little bit of pressure off
8568213 hes a beauty hes kind of i think the energizer bunny for this team
8568214 you know hes the one that stirs stuff up every team has got to have that guy
8568215 the seasons getting shorter we dont have many games left
8568216 we really have to come out and be perfect tomorrow
8568217 a three month period would be a reasonable extent of time for us to play that role to bring together the peace process
8568218 we are concerned about the continuing violence and this is the first segment of our address so that violence should stop
8568219 under pressure and earnings are lower this year than last year for everybody
8568220 its like if wind in a hurricane drops from 140 miles per hour to 130 miles per hour youre still in a hurricane
8568221 the foreign activists sailing back to cyprus is the beginning of the field work to break the siege
8568222 the activists are determined to go on their way until the gaza siege is lifted
8568223 the two sides must stop the hostilities and return to the negotiating table to resolve the thorny issues
8568224 is just a framework agreement and not the final compact
8568225 negotiated in bad faith and raised the expectations of the milf and the moro people
8568226 the moa while recognizing on paper the moro peoples right to self determination was calculated to flounder and fail in the face of legal challenges and the unfounded outcry that it would dismember the philippine republic
8568227 the peace process which reveals the craftsmanship of the us purports to offer the milf a political authority and a degree of ownership over ancestral lands and maritime resources
8568228 disengage from power politics to make way for milf juridical power
8568229 the trouble is not all peace processes are success stories
8568230 with no interference by external parties except to facilitate as in the case of malaysia and to monitor the truce as in the case of the international monitoring team imt
8568231 when money is free the rational lender will keep on lending until there is no one else to lend to
8568232 this unfortunate incident of the slaying of a young man will make the issue of japans international contribution an important agenda of the fukuda administration
8568233 we need to keep an ear close to the ground of the japanese public and opposition parties they could become negative on any support for combat areas
8568234 many think the anti terrorism refueling mission in the indian ocean is a propitiatory act towards the us
8568235 our coalition partner new komeito is very cautious about it
8568236 we know we will suffer a crushing defeat in the next general election
8568237 but we still hope we can narrowly win a majority
8568238 its hard to believe that the us would sabotage the deal at this stage after having initiated the deal and gone out of its way to placate india
8568239 in any case india was involved in negotiating every phrase in the resolutions brought before the iaea and the nsg its futile for india to blame the us it was at best naive for it to trust washington to do everything at the nsg
8568240 you can bet that there are some lawmakers who want to bring in amendments
8568241 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg the discussions last week were robust and constructive
8568242 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the npt and the comprehensive test ban treaty and would welcome indias accession to these we have not included these in our package of proposals
8568243 in no way prejudge s the decision on a possible india specific exemption in the nsg
8568244 although the statement was a clear warning indian negotiators ignored it
8568245 they thought a combination of us strong arm pressures and indias new with us or against us diplomacy would do the trick
8568246 based on concepts already enshrined in un security council resolutions in domestic legislation of nsg member states and in bilateral nuclear supply agreements which they have concluded over the years
8568247 the us will probably try to persuade india to accept at least one of the three proposed conditions namely exclusion of enrichment and reprocessing technology
8568248 it is hard to say if india will agree to this while accepting a periodic review of its non proliferation commitments and cessation of cooperation in case of an indian nuclear test
8568249 that the nsg dissenters will be satisfied with such a modified draft the chances of the deal going through before the present term of the us congress ends seem low
8568250 whats good for the goose is good for the gander
8568251 when the us invaded iraq it didnt do so to improve irans power position in the region but that was the result
8568252 that wasnt the purpose of the russian invasion of georgia either but it too may be the result
8568253 the reason is on grounds of principle if iran is going to start supporting the secession of territories that are unhappy with the central government then iran itself has some similar issues with ethnic dissatisfaction
8568254 dont view russia as a reliable partner they understand that russia may support iran on the nuclear file depending on its own security or policy interests but russia has also been quite clever in using iran as a bargaining chip in terms of its relationship with the united states
8568255 the iranians are being very clever here theyre not likely to rush to russias defense unless russia comes to them and ask for their help and then they can ask for something in return
8568256 oil and gas companies now must factor in a new level of uncertainty
8568257 georgia is now unstable and that increases the risk of transporting hydrocarbons across it
8568258 if the btc and georgia wont be a reliable source of energy then iran will absolutely step up to the plate
8568259 you want gas well sell you gas will likely be their position
8568260 i think the swiss are a very good bellwether for the rest of europe on this
8568261 see the present crisis as an opportunity to go back to european colleagues and say lets take another look at this
8568262 it gives them some more leverage by going to the west and saying youre shooting yourselves in the foot here when are you going to come to your senses
8568263 the question is whether bush and cheney will feel empowered to behave in a more belligerent fashion or not
8568264 no pact or agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
8568265 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions in iraq that has always been our position and it continues to be our position an agreement has not been signed there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
8568266 we cant neglect our sons by giving an open immunity for anyone whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
8568267 i have found it suitable to play my role writing books or in newspapers to shed light on what i believe to be the threat by iranian influence
8568268 we cannot help you if you do not want to help yourselves
8568269 why not iraq has the iraqi curse befallen the citizens as well as leaders of iraq
8568270 we dont think it is in anyones interest to push the pad into a corner they have tens of thousands supporters on the ground and perhaps millions through the astv television station it will be hard for them to just hit the off switch
8568271 there was always the danger of a third hand with a hidden agenda trying to bring the conflict to a head
8568272 the fed chairmans last speech delivered appropriately enough in a hole was on maintaining stability

8568278 no se puede poner al estado de rodillas frente al terrorismo ofreciendo disculpas
8568279 si hubieran le do habr an constatado que el informe de la cvr encuentra la responsabilidad principal y directa de todo el horror que vivi el per en sendero luminoso en su actitud terrorista en su impiedad para matar en segundo lugar encontrar an que no hay ni una sola p gina en la que se diga que hay responsabilidad institucional de las fuerzas armadas
8568280 en ciertos lugares y momentos del conflicto la actuaci n de los miembros de las fuerzas armadas no solo involucr algunos excesos individuales de oficiales o personal de la tropa sino tambi n pr cticas generalizadas y sistem ticas de violaciones de los derechos humanos

8568282 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8568283 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8568284 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8568285 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8568286 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8568287 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8568288 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8568289 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8568290 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8568294 i wonder if anyone else is viewing this issue right now
8568295 im gonna be a man tomorrow weve got a serious problem im tired but i still have this strong desire
8568296 ive already said on the record that at the beginning of 2007 id privately decided to step aside at the end of that year moving to the role of chairman of the mclaren group leaving the role of chief executive officer of the mclaren group to martin whitmarsh currently chief operating officer of the mclaren group
8568297 but as the great economist john maynard keynes once famously said when the situation changes i change my mind well the situation did change so i did change my mind
8568298 now i remain unflinchingly committed to the mclaren group and the vodafone mclaren mercedes team and remain passionately engaged in leading the mclaren group into exciting new areas of business exemplified by but not confined to the groundbreaking projects currently being evaluated by mclaren automotive
8568299 having said that the mclaren groups senior management team is a fabulously impressive one and i have complete faith in their ability to take the mclaren group working with all our shareholders on to pastures even more exciting over the next generation
8568300 spss predictive analytics software supports our mission to act as advocates for our athletes by allowing special olympics to make a solid case for improved quality and access to healthcare for populations worldwide
8568301 i think its too much hype about a year ago we were realising how much hype we were getting and we decided we should start to say that its going to suck just to de hype it that is a certain amount of pressure
8568302 weve gotten to that point any additional hype isnt serving us well its a concern
8568303 i think spore lends itself more to horizontal expansion where we take components of the game like levels or editors into totally different formats and hit people that maybe never even played the hardcore pc game but would enjoy a lighter experience using one of the editors or using the content in new ways outside of spore the game
8568304 what my instructor referred to primly as bs meaning bird shit this last required some special explanation it could he said be used when all else failed and worked well but procuring a supply was not as easy as might be supposed for instance he once had to fall back on it when he was stationed at the hague and had imagined that crumbs spread on his little balcony would bring a goodly number of sparrows that might be relied on to leave behind a supply of bs not so the birds duly arrived and ate the crumbs but whether because they were constipated or out of delicacy there were no droppings in the end he explained to me he had to walk in a public park which fortunately was spacious and when he saw traces of bs he dropped his handkerchief as though by chance and scooped the bs up his dolefulness became almost unbearable as i pictured him walking mournfully about questing for bs and i tried to cheer him up by expressing my unbounded admiration for the brilliant stratagem he had devised which i said i was sure would prove invaluable in mozambique he nodded i thought without much conviction and expressed some doubts as to whether the sort of birds found there would prove suitable donors
8568305 i had the feeling that in thus justifying soviet brutality and ruthlessness duranty was in some way getting his own back for being small and losing a leg and not having the aristocratic lineage and classical education he claimed to have this is probably in the end the only real basis of the appeal of such regimes as stalins and hitlers they compensate for weakness and inadequacy duranty was a little browbeaten boy looking up admiringly at a big bully by the same token if the new york times went on all those years giving great prominence to durantys messages building him and them up when they were so evidently nonsensically untrue this was not to be sure because the times was deceived rather because it wanted to be so deceived and duranty provided the requisite deception material just as the intelligentsia have been foremost in the struggle to abolish intelligence so the great organs of capitalism like the new york times have spared no effort to ensure that capitalism will not survive

8568308 there are no quick fixes but more can be done especially for children who are really struggling with basic literacy and numeracy and for those children who with a bit of help could reach the next level up
8568309 a similar programme for children having problems with basic maths begins this september and we have accepted sir peter williams recommendation that there should be a maths specialist in every school
8568310 younger children a head start by providing good quality play based early learning
8568311 it is shameful that more than one in five boys still dont have a good grasp of the most basic reading and writing skills at the age of seven
8568312 progress in tackling the problem of poor literacy and numeracy amongst our youngest children has stalled

8568320 more recent statistics have already indicted a more or less abrupt change in the number of people afflicted
8568321 in the past two years anti retroviral drugs have become available for free meaning some hiv positive people previously unknown to the authorities are now being reported
8568322 the beauty of this and the adjustment of the fees is that everybody who is eligible gets a place theres none of this where some people pay 877 and other people pay 8000 a year for full private cost recovery

8568326 master there sits a beggar under that tree feeling sympathy to him i advised him few good thoughts but he doesnt mind me at all
8568327 this is the finest opportunity he should be dead today
8568328 i can no more tolerate masters behaviour today i will kill him i will drop this stone on his head

8568330 i tried to kill the master who loves me the most
8568331 what is the right penalty for a student who tried to kill his master
8568332 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8568333 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8568334 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8568335 paolo is not experienced in this car so we are not expecting him to be at the front he was excellent in vallelunga half a second quicker than premas alvaro barba but it is a test at vallelunga not a qualifying session and of course i dont know what programme prema were running

8568339 you need humour in a relationshipsomebody you can laugh with but i feel sometimes the funniest people are covering deeper issues
8568340 humour can work both ways it can make you not be taken seriously thus lowering the respect
8568341 i am basically a happy person and i enjoy intelligent humour in films such as sanjeev kumars angoor which was a comedy of errors and just released hollywood film wedding crashers
8568342 humour is one of the most important ingredients in a relationship but at times it gets annoying when we are in a serious conversation and he cracks a joke and it happens most of the time when i start a serious talk later it may seem funny but at that moment it really makes you lose your cool i am more of an emotional person and he definitely has a better sense of humour and it keeps the relationship balanced especially when we are having a heated argument he is the one who cools down the temperatures and never lets the situation reach a boiling point
8568343 humour gives you a relief it helps avoid serious arguments and clams the situation down before it reaches a war like stage
8568344 we spoke about it at the beginning of the year
8568345 for me it doesnt represent a problem hell react hell soon be strong again he knows how to keep away from criticisms and polemics
8568346 he isnt happy with the way the car enters corners he would like it more aggressive and this influences him its up to us to carry on giving him a hand
8568347 certainly we will have to give him an always competitive car hes mature to manage it and well help him
8568348 we cant anymore afford the luxury of losing important results because of reliability problems
8568349 however its also true that mclaren last year had 35 points more than today and we had 16 more
8568350 its been decided to strengthen controls over the whole component production of the cars
8568351 i am sick to death of all this remorse and rehabilitation get down to basics
8568352 if the legal profession has got this sort of person coming through the ranks g od helps us in the future
8568353 thats a part of julia weve never seen in the 23 years before it occurred and have never seen since
8568354 rather than follow the example set by many thousands of demonstrators she has taken her protests up a notch

8568356 yes freedom of speech and freedom of the press are by far th most important issues facing canada right now nothing short of abolishing the hrcs is acceptable they are completely unnecessary
8568357 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8568358 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8568359 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8568360 surely this is not a work of art but a blashphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people
8568361 wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of gods love
8568362 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8568363 theres shit on your shoe someones put shit on your shoe
8568364 this has been a summer that many retailers would rather forget the downturn in the housing market is continuing to depress sales for those shops selling big ticket items

8568366 this is for students and families who want something different
8568367 she does look like shes had her teeth done during the last few years but who hasnt
8568368 sometimes with the trivial and the minutiae we have to trust the superintendent on his recommendation
8568369 its not always a matter of trust when youre on a board its a matter of legality
8568370 murrysville has the best storm water runoff ordinances in the entire county
8568371 were not only concerned about flooding export were concerned about flooding our own community
8568372 the reality of the situation is you dont have good baseline data for the pre development conditions
8568373 as near as i can tell theres no municipality in the state that has good baseline data for what these pre development conditions truly are
8568374 were really trying to focus on revitalizing our downtown business district and thats going to be hard to do with big box stores and chain stores
8568375 and theres nothing theyre going to put in there thats going to hurt export
8568376 residents often stop by to chat with emergency personnel on duty
8568377 the woman comes up and says you the chief i nodded yes
8568378 i said yes and accepted them i thanked her she nodded smiled and left the building her good deed for the day was done i guess
8568379 i couldnt help wondering though how did members of that church know our organization didnt have animal oxygen masks these masks will hook into oxygen bottles our ambulances carry
8568380 really weve answered emergency distress calls for dogs cats and even cattle we used oxygen masks designed for humans
8568381 once our unit got a frantic call that a male was in cardiac arrest thats all the dispatcher said our crew got there and found a crowd looking at a dog lying on the ground the animal was pretty far gone we tried to bring it back it died
8568382 maybe if we had an animal mask the result might have been happier
8568383 in this business you never know what youre going to face when youre called out now were prepared for anything even dogs
8568384 i needed to be certified in north huntingdon because of the township police k 9 units dogs
8568385 we just figured with the increase in boat traffic every year our 16 foot aluminum was not up to snuff
8568386 were just trying to make sure that everybodys safe thats all
8568387 he slows down and you dont see him you go right up the back
8568388 with this one theres too much potential that people will get hurt
8568389 our volunteers are putting in time to make sure our houses are safe and to protect our children and i think they are taken for granted
8568390 i know that everyone is burdened that people are struggling just to make ends meet thats why i am only asking for 5 it might sound funny but if everyone works together we can make a big difference
8568391 the more you go on the higher the fuel bill runs
8568392 there is an estranged relationship with law enforcement and the african american community not just in swissvale but throughout the country
8568393 were not here today to say all law enforcement officers are bad people but we need to look at the system
8568394 ever since i was a kid ive seen all of my black friends being put down on the ground and being chased by the police
8568395 some cops are good cops but on the same note there are rotten cops
8568396 if were going to build good relationships police cant bash youth and youth cant bash police
8568397 i grew up in swissvale and the police were more community oriented then
8568398 this is a first step in the right direction but there need to be more talks like this with the swissvale police department present
8568399 i may be naive but i dont think police go out and say i want to go kill someone to day
8568400 if you go to council meetings you would not believe the rapport you develop with council members and police
8568401 i feel a fair bipartisan process by this board found a manager who possesses the credentials and experience necessary to meet the growing demands of our rapidly growing municipality
8568402 jim morrisons mandate is to keep our municipality moving forward efficiently
8568403 north huntingdon has similar challenges i feel that murrysville faced when i worked there
8568404 its a really good progressive community with many opportunities my job will be to make sure those opportunities are not wasted
8568405 include working with people and developing a team with everybody pulling in the same direction that includes the commissioners administration staff and appointed boards
8568406 im fortunate to be joining a dedicated proven administrative staff
8568407 what theyve accomplished to make north huntingdon a desirable community to live in and one of the fastest growing municipalities in western pennsylvania i feel speaks for itself ill be depending on them
8568408 my plan is to ask everybody what are your goals and what direction do you want to take to accomplish them i will listen when residents speak out because they also have stake in the townships future
8568409 actually there is no location set yet where the ramp extension would access pennsylvania avenue the study should determine a recommendation
8568410 that study is linked to the proposed turnpike extension feasibility study
8568411 we approached penndot about doing the project they showed interest but would not pay for a feasibility study
8568412 a turnpike exit ramp accessing pennsylvania avenue definitely would impact traffic flowing through irwin motorists use main street and oak street as shortcuts to avoid route 30 traffic congestion to reach north irwin trafford route 993 and penn township
8568413 were thinking speed bumps and stop signs to slow traffic thats not enough to slow down the volume of traffic that would be generated by an extension its going to be a nightmare for our residents
8568414 the study should include recommendations to reduce traffic congestion on all roads in that area
8568415 i feel an extension of the west exit ramp would reduce turnpike traffic trying to access route 30 the traffic gridlock at rush hour is terrible and its getting worse
8568416 i just felt at that moment that i didnt make a difference
8568417 the combination of rapidly increasing costs for payroll and benefits for our police department is too much for us to handle right now
8568418 the heart and soul of a town are in its people
8568419 its not in its facilities its not in its police force or ambulance service
8568420 we just figured with the increase in boat traffic every year our 16 foot aluminum was not up to snuff
8568421 were just trying to make sure that everybodys safe thats all
8568422 he slows down and you dont see him you go right up the back
8568423 with this one theres too much potential that people will get hurt
8568424 i like to donate the money because it will help make my brother happy
8568425 you can tell that raeann really loves and cares about her brother
8568426 shes constantly ahead of him knowing what he wants she is a kind hearted little girl
8568427 people know that the bracelets are for a good cause and they appeal to a lot of people who can personally relate to them
8568428 raeann can make them by request too and you usually have them the next day thats how quick she is
8568429 i have remembrance bracelets autism ones and i have bought birthstone bracelets for my daughters
8568430 there are even quite a few that i have given as gifts

8568465 we are classified as a sport and we treat participants as athletes
8568466 a lot of people dont realize the work that goes into it but its probably one of the hardest sports said ashley contristano 23 varsity cheerleading coach for keystone oaks school district
8568467 these girls are gymnasts and all their movements take tons of precision
8568468 they utilize most of the muscles in their body in doing stunts tumbling or dancing
8568469 they have to be in good physical shape to do all that they do
8568470 i cheered from the time i was in first or second grade and it was a huge part of my life growing up and a really positive experience
8568471 after college i wanted to be able to spend time giving back to the other girls
8568472 as the sport is constantly evolving with more difficult stunts it presents the girls with new challenges and something to work toward to experience that achievement
8568473 i really like being a part of not only cheerleading but in helping them grow into young leaders
8568474 i hope that all the girls are successful not only in cheerleading but in life and any assistance i can lend in that regard is readily given
8568475 im taking a stay cation next month when were going to visit all the cultural spots in the burg places such as the sen john heinz history center the andy warhol the carnegie museum of art and the like we had planned to go to chautauqua an educational institute in southwestern new york state but the cost of gas for our type of vehicle put that trip on the back burner
8568476 the high cost of fuel most certainly factored into my familys summer activities we stayed closer to home our cars run on diesel fuel and as one knows it costs significantly more than gasoline
8568477 economically it certainly was a worse summer than normal as the cost of just about everything has skyrocketed but personally summer with my family was delightful no matter that we stayed close to home
8568478 i never fill up my gas tank anymore this year i loved being in my garden and spending time biking on the montour and youghiogheny trails
8568479 i spent time and money to travel for a month in india this summer my dollar went further there the u s dollar is worth about 44 indian rupees even though the dollar is down overseas against the euro things are still affordable in india
8568480 i golfed a lot and hung out with friends the economy didnt interfere with that it was a summer like any other
8568481 the economy didnt necessary affect me i was just too busy to vacation this year we added an extra dining room in the restaurant and that kept me very busy if you give people good service and good value they will continue to frequent your restaurant
8568482 strains on the economy mean that people tip less it also hit me when i flew to the jersey shore and my plane ticket was more than usual and the airlines also charged me 15 for a bag
8568483 i traveled only once to lancaster county to visit my grandchildren in previous years i would have gone five times over the summer but the cost of gas has really impacted me
8568484 also the cost of pet care has really gone up
8568485 it was the worst summer ever both my parents lost their jobs i stayed home and hung out with friends still we went to the pool and kennywood
8568486 i just returned from toronto canada this morning a friend was driving there so i tagged along it was fun we met up with his family and friends for barbecues
8568487 i took a trip to baltimore with friends we split the costs of gas and hotel i made do with the situation so the summer was fine
8568488 originally we had the concept of doing a three or four story facade on the side of the under renovation denis theater that involved a trolley people walking
8568489 when they asked me to redesign it it was basically just the idea of doing the walking thing
8568490 we have 130 kids paid 20 teachers 40 artists 50 ex offenders a fitness manager a music manager a fashion manager
8568491 the wall is really irregular a lot of different sizes and textures
8568492 we were talking about pittsburgh 250 and some of the highlights of pittsburgh and one of the things that was mentioned was phipps conservatory so i took inspirations from that
8568493 it kind of ties in with all of the businesses we talk about it being a little garden for the neighborhood
8568494 i cant tell you how many people have stopped in to tell us how much they like that mural
8568495 this was done without township county city or anyone elses money we did this all on our own and i think thats very important
8568496 the buildings in better shape now than when we started
8568497 the prep work probably took two weeks to get it solid but its worth the time to get it right because it adds length to the life of the artwork
8568498 kind of the fun part of doing this mural is that its in my neighborhood i hear people talking about it a few think a new business is going in there is it a garden shop or a travel agency opening up
8568499 what did you do on you do on your summer vacation
8568500 i didnt do anything this summer i will fly to tampa in the fall to visit my son but i booked the airfare during a sale if he didnt live there i would not be going anywhere just making short trips
8568501 i went to ocean city md with my family we drove so the gas was the worst part it was six hours from pittsburgh i havent gone on a family vacation for about 10 years so it made a great summer for me
8568502 it was just awful i took a bus to syracuse n y to work at a carnival then the carnival company didnt give me my final pay so a friend had to drive me home to pittsburgh
8568503 we went canoeing near dawson and we bought a house because of the bad real estate market we were able to get an excellent deal on our house
8568504 despite the economy for me it was a blessed summer i went to myrtle beach for a week and will be going to jamaica in the fall i did have a car accident but that forced me to grow up a bit
8568505 i did my usual work around the house things such as cutting the grass if they did something about the gas prices id be able to go somewhere
8568506 it was a good summer we were married on july 19 and went to las vegas on our honeymoon we saw cirque du soleil and stayed in the honeymoon suite at the bellagio we hung out at the pool and went to fancy restaurants
8568507 we combined several trips that we would have taken separately we visited family in boston and friends in vermont we went in my wifes car because she gets 33 miles per gallon

8568511 there is no strong evidence yet for specific gene variants alleles gt that lead to group differences differences between clusters in gt behavior or intelligence but progress on the genomic side of this gt question will be rapid in coming years as the price to sequence a gt genome is dropping at an exponential rate
8568512 what seems to be true from preliminary studies is that the gene variants that were under strong selection reached fixation over the last 10k years are different in different clusters that is the way that modern people in each cluster differ due to natural selection from their own ancestors 10k years ago is not the same in each cluster we have been at least at the genetic level experiencing divergent evolution

8568548 it was an all girl drum and bugle corps that actually started in butler in 1940
8568549 she only took this position because of us and because of her great organizational skills and its funny because many of the instructors she hired for us have gone on to become big names in the drum and bugle corps scene
8568550 she would never let six weeks go by without seeing them no matter where we were at the time
8568551 that was the neighborhood where mom grew up and lived for many many years and they have all kept in touch
8568552 she sent quite a few of those out to a lot of people
8568553 all these hours just to be a volunteer becomes an issue when you get out of school and you have other interests and other priorities like a family and a job
8568554 i cant say enough about highlands high school for having the courage and the foresight to get involved in this its tremendous
8568555 its an incentive to save some money when they go on to college
8568556 if you are trained and volunteer to serve theyll give you free board at the college
8568557 were challenging the community to get involved if the community meets the challenge then were going to give the alliance 25 000 to use for firefighter scholarships
8568558 any young firefighter trainee who goes through the school program and graduates will be eligible
8568559 if 500 people come and attend any of those community safety sessions then they will have met their goal
8568560 when the whistle blows you expect someone to show up its getting to the point that especially during the day its just not going to happen
8568561 after 9 11 boy we thought wed have all these people wanting to be firemen to be heroes but it didnt happen
8568562 the idea of the environment isnt something thats only in science it has a direct connection with social studies
8568563 were teaching kids about science and in a lot of our discussion today in current affairs and current trends were trying to be more energy efficient
8568564 its just kind of a way of life now and to promote that with our kids is important
8568565 my dream is to have children laughing and playing on the hillside down behind us
8568566 not just to design a building but work with our client to design a community
8568567 we still dont want it and we are not happy about it
8568568 some of our early efforts to inform neighbors were disrupted
8568569 neighbors may be invited in small groups up to hearth offices to talk about where we are and where we are going
8568570 if they do approach you say yes without having to come back to the board
8568571 the idea of the environment isnt something thats only in science it has a direct connection with social studies
8568572 were teaching kids about science and in a lot of our discussion today in current affairs and current trends were trying to be more energy efficient
8568573 its just kind of a way of life now and to promote that with our kids is important
8568574 an innovative program to prevent and treat child abuse which is the mission of family resources
8568575 when we see a child having a meltdown or a child standing dangerously in a shopping cart we dont know what to do
8568576 we are all kind of helpless and freeze when we see others in this situation what we want to do is enable people to assist these parents
8568577 the video showed how people could assist parents with their children through gentle intervention
8568578 i came aboard the project in the fall of 2002 when my boys were almost 3 and 5
8568579 we knew it was a great concept but we asked ourselves how can we get everyday people to understand and use this concept
8568580 lets just say that my younger son has always been an intense and loud child i was living it
8568581 i never got to meet him and i wanted to know his thoughts and plans for the program
8568582 what is the first thing you see on the show
8568583 we want people to stop and recognize when they may be able to help a parent or child take a moment to pause think and get ready to assist and three try one kind word to assist
8568584 getting involved may be as simple as standing closer to a shopping cart where a child is standing and in a dangerous situation while the parent is busy with another child
8568585 that was a lot of fun we filmed the video at the giant eagle in the waterworks from midnight to 6 a m here we are filming a video about child abuse and we had children there in the middle of the night
8568586 we had to get all sorts of waivers and special permission to make it
8568587 based on our feedback we can say that we can really impact how people can help parents in difficult situations
8568588 we want it to be a regional showpiece we want to put the message out in our region that one kind word can make a difference to someone
8568589 we have been talking with a major grocery store chain and other places such as museums and amusement parks we feel that anywhere large groups of families with children gather will be the ideal sites for the program
8568590 preparing shovel ready land is the key to jump starting development stimulating job growth and attracting new businesses within the airport corridor and the surrounding area
8568591 thats when you know youve hit the jackpot as far as economic development
8568592 they led the way in the marketplace they said we believe in this and we think it will work that was a huge step
8568593 walking up the hill it was like everybody was reaching out a hand wanting to touch you wanting you to touch them wanting to talk to you wanting to have you acknowledge them
8568594 as we came over the hill the crowd kind of erupted in cheering
8568595 i asked our interpreter about it and he said they just want to come see the american doctor and have the american doctor tell them theyre ok
8568596 we sent him to the ship to have his colostomy reversed it changed his life without the surgery he would have had a colostomy for the rest of his life
8568597 those are cases where you just dont know what to say
8568598 they leave and in the back of your mind you know theyre going to die
8568599 being in military life you learn to do as much as you can for as many as you can
8568600 coming from a small community a lot of times you dont know what else is out there
8568601 its really any opportunity to talk about the fact that this stuff is happening
8568602 people think were here to kill and destroy that were out here just to fight wars
8568603 but were really out here to prevent wars and to help people who need it
8568604 my idea of italian cuisine was franco american in a can
8568605 i dont know if the generation coming up will keep it going
8568606 more of them are couples where they are both professionals and they also have family here
8568607 there were the beaver dams and the monkey vines and fossil rock
8568608 wed have to clean them up to get them ready for bed
8568609 i think every boy in the neighborhood worked for him at one time or another
8568610 i tell my friends about it and there are other neighborhood groups but no one has a neighborhood like this
8568611 it was just a really really tight family kind of thing
8568612 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
8568613 i want people to come away saying whether im voting for the guy or against the guy i know what he stands for
8568614 he has to lay out chapter and verse what his plans are for job creation health care and dealing with the rich poor gap
8568615 and hes got to do it in short punchy sentences
8568616 were seeing too much of a one dimensional obama were not seeing the human side
8568617 hes got to be more forceful hes got to use the speech to assert himself as leader of the party

8568623 we prefer to present this special facility to the public when there is some grass and landscaping and when it better resembles a park
8568624 we dont want this to be just one event rather a series of events that come together
8568625 we know that oak ridge is much more than just the last 10 years but this year gives us a reason to celebrate
8568626 its always been about people and what makes oak ridge special and not just the incorporation
8568627 my personal experience is that people around here are very conservative with water especially when they have to pay for it
8568628 the ones that do id assume would be the older wells under 50 feet deep that depend on runoff
8568629 with that being said id still encourage people not to waste water
8568630 the town council took the unusual step of requesting a meeting between staff developer and residents of the neighborhood to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the case
8568631 with such a positive response we decided to make our garden art available to the public
8568632 we are investigating whether he is operating a business out of a residential property a location not zoned for commercial retail sales
8568633 what it comes down to in this particular case is is it artwork or commercial sales if he wants them to be art as weve currently classified them they cannot be offered for sale
8568634 well art is art and how many pieces of art arent sold everyday

8568674 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8568675 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8568676 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8568677 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8568678 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8568679 moral legal and practical gravity to publicize it to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
8568680 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8568681 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8568682 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face

8568686 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8568687 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8568688 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8568689 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8568690 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8568691 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon

8568703 officially proclaimed a state of public emergency from 19 may 1948 four days after its founding until the present day
8568704 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
8568705 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
8568706 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
8568707 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8568708 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
8568709 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal

8568751 i was flat out told that this is how the iphone behaves and nothing is wrong every time it changes wifi networks it has to establish its email port 25 over and over again and so it will not connect to the next network it finds until you restart your iphone
8568752 where were you sent you an email you missed the meeting
8568753 in the 14 days since we launched its been a rocky road and we know the pain some people have been suffering
8568754 be assured people here are working 24 7 to improve matters and were going to favor getting you new info hot off the presses even if we have to post corrections or further updates later

8568758 team the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour there are several things we could have done better mobileme was simply not up to apples standards it clearly needed more time and testing rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme eddys new title will be vice president internet services and he will now report directly to me yes i have had many many issues since upgrading my gen1 4gb phone to 2 0 email does not download properly from my pop3 server several accounts message previews dont show up consistently selecting a message from inbox results in endless spinning status indicator s very often and no message body showing up even after several minutes of spinning status indicator and no errors indicated either the emails have no attachments in most cases and are 1 2 pages so maybe 4 8k max in size networking in general seems to have been tanked by 2 0 the range of the wi fi seems less and the cellphone signal seems weaker than it was in the past fewer bars in general the edge egprs network access seems much slower too which is hard to do this release really seems to be a huge pos thats been my experience apple over i am so upset since i expected the normal apple quality and got ms quality instead oh to the apple zealots i dont want to see a single reply to this about how your phone was upgraded offline and works great or any of that crap i upgraded the phone with itunes online just like all the other updates if there was a better undocumented preference for upgrading the phone offline and this obscure method was the result of some de developing the upgrade process by doing offline upgrades during regression testing that from a software consistency qa and ease of use standpoint is incredibly lame and nothing but shear incompetence they should go work for ms to think someone will second guess the online update vs offline method is ludicrous and extremely bone headed the upgrade should work identically regardless of method used clear on that one zealots i do know what software development is difficult particularly when looking for bugs and trying to fix things but i agree that apple definitely dropped the ball on this one just like how steve jobs sent an email out to his employees about waiting for the introduction of mobileme well they should had made absolutely sure and positive that the 2 0 update was working stable none of that clunky lagging scrolling text messaging contact scrolling broken email lost weak signal etc etc crap oh well i too know how difficult design engineering can be since i worked at another unix platform company for 8 years doing design engineering and program management a really bright company i know how the process works and i know how the marketing pucks will push p1s1s out the door despite being out voted in the pm release meetings i hate to see apple do it to themselves again they changed the industry with the iphone just look at all the korean amp japanese knock offs coming out almost every month since july 2007 i would hate to see a replay of the 80s when arrogance in marketing resulted in a lost opportunity and 150b in billy gs pockets i spent 15 years in the valley from 1985 to 2000 i used to see wozniak at the original pancake house in saratoga nearly every saturday or sunday in the late 80s early 90s they apple have had mobile phones on their minds for quite sometime because back in 1990 wozniak had a home made wrist watch based cellphone he used a timex calculator watch or similar for the keypad and display had an earpiece and the guts of the phone on his belt in a 4x4x2

8568768 i couldnt help but reflect on how china and america have spent the last seven years china has been preparing for the olympics weve been preparing for al qaeda theyve been building better stadiums subways airports roads and parks and weve been building better metal detectors armored humvees and pilotless drones

8568780 we were totally gobsmacked and disgusted that this text was sent out an hour later to us
8568781 to text the person who calls and ask them to investigate what had been stolen broken into and who did it is just incredible
8568782 it just gives burglars the idea that they can get away with it because the police arent going to send anyone out
8568783 i wouldve thought they should have been able to catch a man in a white t shirt as there couldnt have been many running around the area at five in the morning
8568784 due to the number of emergency calls at that time we were unable to send an officer straight to the scene
8568785 all calls have to be graded by their urgency and unfortunately at this time there were a number of incidents including reports of disorder and assaults which police were attending

8568799 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8568800 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8568801 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine

8568855 a breakthrough the first complete report of the state of our field
8568856 mtn hasnt experienced the massive geographical expansion characterising its last reporting periods but that certainly doesnt mean its not been active
8568857 the company has targeted acquisitions that will complement its existing service offering the deals concerning italk cellular in south africa and verizon business in various african states are examples of this
8568858 frost amp sullivan anticipates increased movement from mtn into the provision of data services in keeping with the decisions the operator has made in south africa and nigeria
8568859 the operator has already extended its investment in fibre optic infrastructure in south africa from a single project in a high traffic area between rosebank and sandton to a national network that will be 5 000 km in length in nigeria mtn is already a fixed and mobile services provider it is not unreasonable to assume that these are a sign of things to come in other markets
8568860 the operators proven ability to quickly enter a market establish infrastructure and distribution channels and then launch quality services will stand it in good stead for new market entrances
8568861 this has been recognised by international players such as bharti and reliance and is one of the key reasons for their interest in investing in the african operator

8568882 what we wanted to see was a churchillian speech something that would move her candidate to cross that magic fence and she delivered a speech but the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really werent there
8568883 i think her message was supposed to be hey go with me and lets vote for barack there should have been a lot more emotive displays and we just simply did not see that
8568884 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us whats important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech
8568885 when she was talking about mccain there was a lot of emphasis when she talked about her husband we saw more non verbals from the audience in regards to these issues than we saw from her
8568886 one of the ways that we emphasize is by defying gravity
8568887 and our shoulders come up or we stand on our toes she does that a little bit but thats so weak that we tend to miss it
8568888 now toward the end of her speech we saw her hands come up and high and so forth this is where emotion was truly there
8568889 on when you see her i think a couple of times there when they were picturing her perhaps she was thinking this should be a little better and so forth but i think michelle was very receptive her non verbals actually were great at the beginning as she was you know you saw a lot of head tilt which is indicative of im receptive and so forth
8568890 the single most important thing i have to make clear is the choice we have in november between the same failed policy of the last eight years for the middle class and the new agenda to boost income for americans and help families who are struggling
8568891 im not into looking for signs i think well continue to make our case europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very shortsighted decision on their part
8568892 it was one of those meetings to help clear up the situation get an understanding of the issues and look for a way forward

8568901 we were totally gobsmacked and disgusted that this text was sent out an hour later to us
8568902 to text the person who calls and ask them to investigate what had been stolen broken into and who did it is just incredible
8568903 it just gives burglars the idea that they can get away with it because the police arent going to send anyone out
8568904 i wouldve thought they should have been able to catch a man in a white t shirt as there couldnt have been many running around the area at five in the morning
8568905 due to the number of emergency calls at that time we were unable to send an officer straight to the scene
8568906 all calls have to be graded by their urgency and unfortunately at this time there were a number of incidents including reports of disorder and assaults which police were attending

8568924 er zijn maar twee dingen die oneindig zijn en dat is het universum en de menselijke stommiteit en ik ben er niet zeker van of de eerste juist is
8568925 there are tickets for the lower stands but they are for the corners of the stadium
8568926 but there are plenty of tickets for the top tiers of the croke park we dont envisage any shortage of tickets there will be plenty of tickets on sale
8568927 there was a bit of a delay which allowed me to get focussed i knew where i wanted to place the kick so from that point of view it wasnt too difficult
8568928 three of us usually practice penalty kicks in training and i suppose the job became mine after we lost donnacha oconnor and daniel goulding
8568929 i had scored two goals from the penalty spot in that goal before so it would be fair to say that i was the obvious choice in this one
8568930 its important for the team to be positive not have the heads down
8568931 we know we have the capability of winning if we work hard and play to our potential but its all on the day
8568932 cork know that they still have a chance we still have a chance we know that we have it all to do again and we know that if we can execute more of our shots the next day then we will have a great chance of winning
8568933 we just kept plugging away and really came into the game when it was nearing the end
8568934 to be honest you just blot out the scoreboard and the time remaining and just keep playing thats what we did
8568935 kerry had a real period of dominance and pulled away from us on the scoreboard but never once did we believe that all was lost
8568936 they drove on from there and we were in a bit of disarray but that happens sometimes when youre the side with more men
8568937 we never lost our belief and while it took a long while for us to settle we did and a great point from john miskella only our second of the half pushed us on
8568938 then john hayes with his free and when james punched to the net it was a real boost for us even at that late stage
8568939 at that stage it was all or nothing and i was driving on for a shot at goal
8568940 next thing a player came across me and im on the ground winded im not the one to say whether it should have been awarded or not all ill say is well take it
8568941 today sport had a bearing you got to play for 70 minutes you got to play all the time chances are going to go to the opposition they are going to come your way unfortunately you have to take the ones that come your way and you have to try and defend what comes against you
8568942 considering the quality of kerry they blow an eight point lead with six or seven minutes to go
8568943 thats sport thats the reality of sport it would be far worse if we were having this conversation and we had lost
8568944 its very disappointing for darragh darragh is a very passionate player he has given fantastic service as an amateur player to this game unfortunately he gets targeted and blamed and painted with different brushes all his career
8568945 im not really sure certainly some players are pencilled out because of their talent and others because are pencilled out because of their inspiration
8568946 i thought when darragh was sent off a lot of our players stepped up when we were down a man i thought we performed very well
8568947 s is still trying to remain positive in the aftermath of sundays all ireland senior football semi final
8568948 s is still looking forward with sundays replay in croker firmly in mind
8568949 its important for the team to be positive not have the heads down
8568950 we know we have the capabilities of winning if we work hard and play to our potential but its all on the day cork showed there what they are like we knew it would be a dogfight
8568951 we definitely had the chances to win the game it was very disappointing the way that we finished up there
8568952 cork know that they still have a chance we still have a chance we know that we have it all to do again and we know that if we can execute more of our shots the next day then we will have a great chance of winning
8568953 s was delighted with the response that kerry showed after his brother darragh was red carded early in the second half
8568954 its back to the drawing board for us we know that we have a lot to do
8568955 the response after darragh was sent off was great and i think thats a great sign of our team when the chips were down we rallied hard we probably took our eye off the ball took our foot off the pedal and we let cork back in
8568956 its hard to say really because it was in the last eight minutes that it happened
8568957 its disappointing we came up here expecting big things i suppose its like going back to the tipperary game a learning experience for us and hopefully well come back bigger and stronger the next day
8568958 we were expecting a tough game but the rub of the green wasnt with us
8568959 that gives us an incentive to go on and improve and make sure that we do play better the next day
8568960 i thought that it took us a while to get used to the pitch here in croker but we did that in the second half we seemed to fall apart we lost our shape completely and mayo came at us they upped the tempo of the game luckily we got a point or two at the end of the game
8568961 we didnt underestimate them mayo are a very good team they have some very skilful forwards they moved the ball very well straight up the field
8568962 hopefully this weekend well come up bigger and stronger well have to learn a lot from this game
8568963 i was listening to the premiership on saturday and id be a bit of a liverpool fan
8568964 they were a goal down late on but pulled one back and got a winner near the end
8568965 i said at the time that that was a team which was mentally strong and i think there was a bit of that in us our fellows have been doing that all year
8568966 i said to selector ger osullivan we need two goals to be honest little did i think that wed get two at that stage we didnt play well and id be the first to admit that kerry were much better than us on the day
8568967 these lads have taken a lot of punishment from kerry over the years we could have died but they stuck with it and that character must count for something
8568968 once we have that in the tank theres always a possibility
8568969 id hope sport might level itself out at some stage in terms of commitment and determination these guys have given it everything
8568970 sometimes you end up empty handed where theres light theres hope and theyve always kept that light shining
8568971 im delighted with the character and spirit of my players and if they keep that up who knows what will happen the next day
8568972 kerry will always be favourites and theyll probably be firmer favourites the next day as well
8568973 they gave up a lead on sunday they gave up a lead in the munster final we must do the work ourselves and not depend on others to do it for us
8568974 well i suppose we got out of jail really i havent had a chance of looking at the stats yet but i think mayo had 14 wides to our eight
8568975 mayo dominated territorially for long periods of the game and midway through the second half it looked like curtains for us but we dug deep and we got the equaliser near the end
8568976 full credit to mayo they played exceptionally well i suppose we were built up after our win against offaly
8568977 theyre young lads and they believe in it in all the hype and i think it shows that favouritism at under age carries very little weight because the last game should be forgotten about and the next one is the most important
8568978 happy enough but very disappointed with the performance we lived off of scraps and our full forward line i think got just one point from play they got 3 9 in the previous game so it goes to show that the ball wasnt going in there because mayo cut it out
8568979 we didnt become a bad team overnight theyre very disappointed in there and theres only place to go after this and were glad to get a second chance
8568980 looking at the build up and looking at the guys before the game they seemed to be relaxed we didnt seem to have the hunger they mayo were first to the ball they won primary possession and we didnt scrap hard enough to win the breaking ball like we did in the last two games
8568981 certainly we would be disappointed with that because of our work ethic was a pale shadow of what it was against tipperary and against offaly
8568982 people questioned james being on the panel with us but james has worked hard to get back from his shoulder injury in just a little over two weeks
8568983 it shows his determination he was a bit ring rusty in his kicking but he won possession which was vital and he scrapped and he won the last free that resulted in the equaliser so were quite happy with him that time on the field will bring him on
8568984 jacks work rate and his pace won ball that we werent winning previously it shows that we have a good strong bench and were prepared to use them when lads are not performing it gives us a headache for the replay
8568985 i dont think so really i thought that with the forwards we had the open spaces would suit them but on the day it didnt
8568986 i think that we have to give credit to mayo they played exceptionally well they worked hard they were written off coming up to the game and you write off a team like that at your peril
8568987 we didnt write them off we knew that when they beat monaghan that they were a pretty good side and they ran a good tyrone team pretty close in ulster we knew it was going to be difficult maybe people out side the camp thought that it was going to be an easy win after our facile win against offaly
8568988 the kerry football team have just been spotted walking greyhounds around the gap of dunloe pat oshea is trying to teach them how to hold onto a lead
8568989 do you know that it was 7 1 for kerry to win by seven or more points
8568990 you must be glad you kept your money in your pocket now youre a fiver better off
8568991 s get dismissed against cork in the munster final we have the while galvin gate saga now darragh is sent off again and omahony exaggerates a challenge to get a player red carded
8568992 it was very disappointing to come out with just a draw i suppose at the back of our heads we thought we had it won again
8568993 we will be positive ahead of the game on sunday we have to keep the heads down and work hard this week because we have a great chance to put things right this sunday
8568994 these things happen in sport its all part of it we have to keep the focus
8568995 we will be back in training this week we will talk to each other see what happened and make sure that it doesnt happen again we have to keep the heads up
8568996 its not like cork won the game they were jumping up and down after celebrating maybe they think that have it won we have a lot of work to do
8568997 its not like we lost even though it feels like we have we still have another opportunity and we will be looking to make the most of that
8568998 we have a lot of hunger to win this all ireland and we have a lot of hunger to beat these cork boys

8569039 additionally i think the question of which way of improving fighting your equal or your superior is dependent upon the game and the player and is hardly something that can be accurately discussed on a forum
8569040 one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the most skillful

8569085 the question is how are we going to adjust to that and what sort of help can we provide to those who are going to struggle the most
8569086 there is genuine concern about the difficulties that people will face paying their heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8569087 what we shouldnt do is create a climate that makes it harder to attract new investment the new nuclear investment the new renewables investment the new investment in clean coal and gas
8569088 we need 100 billion plus in the next 10 years so weve got to create the right framework that encourages investment so we must not lose sight of that
8569089 and we shouldnt do anything that has the effect of putting up bills further
8569090 energy security is fundamental to our existence as an independent democratic free state
8569091 i think the events not just in georgia but over a longer timescale have really confirmed the growing importance of energy independence for the uk
8569092 russia has huge energy resources and could be a really good partner for europe but its harder to do that when you see what is unfolding on the international stage
8569093 we must do as much as we can to get energy from indigenous sources britain needs more energy suppliers its harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way russia has been doing lately
8569094 and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they dont think theres a reasonable return to be made on their investment
8569095 finally it is also worth bearing in mind that a lot of these shareholdings in these companies are actually owned by the pension funds and insurance companies
8569096 so this rather primitive 19th century view of capitalism that some people still have that these companies are somehow still owned by a few very rich individuals is just not true

8569139 daves christianity is an important part of who he is as a political leader

8569163 a majority of new york city council members support or are open to overturning the term limit laws that will force most of them and mayor michael r bloomberg from office in 16 months according to a telephone survey conducted by the new york times with mr bloomberg considering a bid to change the term limits to 12 years from the current 8 the results of the survey suggest that the mayor would find ample support for such a proposal in the council
8569164 has the authority to rewrite the law with or without voter ratification
8569165 besides eliminating the difficulties of looking for a new job members of the council said that extending term limits would give voters a chance to re elect battle tested leaders allow members to complete unfinished work and bring stability to city government as new york enters a financial downturn
8569166 but members said that the decision to alter term limits and allow them to seek a third term would largely rest with the mayor if he signals his support many said in interviews the council will quickly change the law
8569167 such a change could carry a steep political price tag mr
8569168 the day we change the term limits is the day we take a step toward dictatorship
8569169 we seem to have someone in the mayors office and speakers office who think they can change the law to stay in office
8569170 the prospect of overturning term limits has captivated the citys political class it has even dominated discussion among new york officials including a dozen or so council members who are attending the democratic national convention this week
8569171 is it 52 people 51 council members and the mayor or is it 8 million people voting to legislate this could be a kiss of death for decades to come
8569172 because it becomes an issue that every future campaign opponent can use unilaterally overturning what the people have very clearly stated is their intent

8569225 we are now quite certain that foreign militants living in pakistan and their pakistani hosts infuriated with islamabads cooperation with beijing are carrying out these attacks
8569226 we were puzzled because we knew that insurgents who are involved in much of the violence in balochistan have neither the resources nor the capacity to carry out such a suicide attack now we know for sure that it was the handiwork of islamists linked to uighur militants who are trying to settle scores with the chinese government

8569262 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8569263 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8569264 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8569265 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8569266 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8569267 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8569268 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8569269 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8569270 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8569271 its great its just an honor to be a representative and be among the few hispanic artists of the world
8569272 emilio and rick trevino freddy fender and johnny rodriguez i have some big shoes to fill there with these guys but its just great im just here to represent all our country fans too
8569273 the national health service should cover the drug cost of lucentis ranibizumab for the first 14 injections in each eye being treated if people need more than 14 injections per eye the manufacturer of ranibizumab has agreed to take over the drug cost from the nhs
8569274 an important collaboration that will ensure patients living with wet amd in england and wales receive the best possible care
8569275 we are committed to working in partnership with health authorities to ensure that as many patients as possible with wet amd can benefit from treatment with lucentis
8569276 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period our guidance means that patients who are suitable for this treatment will have the same access to it irrespective of where they live
8569277 a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country
8569278 finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8569279 those responsible for nice should be aware that during the cumbersome two year review process 152 primary care trusts have individually had the power to decide whether to let patients go blind or to save their sight the resulting stress and suffering has been cruel and unnecessary many hundreds of vulnerable patients have been subjected to an appalling emotional rollercoaster ride for the past two years during which many of them have lost their remaining sight
8569280 there is now nowhere left for pcts to hide we want them to implement nice guidance immediately rnib is also calling on hospitals to ensure they build capacity as a matter of urgency so they can save the sight of patients without further delay
8569281 babies under 12 months pick up the intonation and warmth in the voice and listen to the tune of your conversation
8569282 and from one onwards your child will be sensitive to the words
8569283 normally the family has to step in or they may have to stay in the hospital for longer periods of time or they may have to choose to go into a seniors home
8569284 before i thought it might have been that theres no education or training
8569285 but now in the past year or two they do have that out there in the college so people are being trained but apparently theyre not going out into the field
8569286 not just with the homecare agencies ive heard it through town everyone is looking for employees
8569287 it certainly increases the risk if they cant manage their home clean and safely some people if they cant maintain their home end up going into a long term care facility and it probably also increases the demand on family support
8569288 right now if you have the option of going to work in a hospital or long term care facility youre probably looking at almost double the wage that you would get working as a home support worker in the community so there is certainly a lack of incentive with the low wages that are paid
8569289 unless youre working an extremely large amount of hours its not something you can support a family on
8569290 in some cases you have to be helping people in and out of bathtubs and youre basically lifting people its physically strenuous
8569291 it can be stressful because youre so connected with their entire life that it can hurt you
8569292 its kind of like you have two families i find that with a lot with workers you try to tell them over and over that its a work relationship and you have to keep it a work relationship
8569293 we have a couple of hot spots a lot of time minor vandalism done to the ball field facilities and we get the occasional peoples plants tipped over but nothing on a large scale
8569294 im so surprised in gander being a fairly substantial sized town and we dont have a lot of issues
8569295 lets face it vandalism in my experience most incidents of mischief are probably perpetrated by young people
8569296 and weve got some good rec facilities its the old saying idle hands make mischievous work i think thats part of it
8569297 but it doesnt seem to be a major issue here
8569298 i think organized activities play a big part in it because then theyre not bored
8569299 theyre not just walking around looking for something to do so the organized programs for the summer i think really do make a difference and the fact that theres so much in the way of organized sports that plays a big part too
8569300 at night while we do see young people congregate its not an area where you go to the next day and its vandalized in any way
8569301 i think we got to give some credit to the young people
8569302 perhaps major lornes team would like that particular rescue mission
8569303 id like to maam but i was firmly instructed to never send the colonels hu second in command on his rescue i believe he said it had something to do with being yelled at
8569304 hmm then i suppose its up to captain marcuss team then
8569305 just in time colonel we were just deciding who would run your rescue mission
8569306 the kind that connect up with ancient technology and adapt the power requirements to the devices needs
8569307 so are you telling me that weve found a new self adapting generator
8569308 yeah at least thats what it looks like right now he hasnt run any serious tests yet
8569309 well see its kind of too big to bring back through the gate and there are a few people who might i dont know call it home
8569310 no we will not displace an entire civilization for the sole purposes of rodneys experiments
8569311 well it wouldnt just be for rodneys experiments it would be for the good of the expedition
8569312 stop right there if and i stress if rodney is welcome by these people to study this power source then he is welcome to do so if he is not welcome ask radek otherwise this gets stored in the databank and revisited occasionally
8569313 well look on the bright side at least theres civilization on this planet
8569314 if you can call this civilization i seriously doubt these people have ever seen a zpm or anything even remotely related to it
8569315 ah that my friend is a very special thing it was taken from the nameless temple and is known simply as ungula simiam
8569316 do you see those three stones they represent wishes the ungula simiam will grant three wishes to its bearer however you must be warned to be careful what you wish for for there are always unforeseen consequences
8569317 so you brought this device back even though you have no idea what it is
8569318 please i honestly dont think theres anything to worry about its hardly giving off any significant amounts of energy
8569319 just about everyone who knows ancient here looked at it and they were only able to piece together a few things of what it said apparently its some strange form of the language that no one can really figure out but as far as they can tell it says something about the coming true of dreams or hopes or
8569320 as ive said before sheppard i seriously doubt this thing can actually grant wishes
8569321 is what you should be figuring out rodney just be careful the last thing we need is you blowing up the science labs
8569322 for the last time i highly doubt that this device has the ability to grant wishes now how many times am i going to have to repeat myself
8569323 so if youre getting so annoyed why dont try just saying i wish everyone in the city would be less stupid
8569324 the guy said you get three right well looks like ronons taken one
8569325 i wish mckay would successfully get together with colonel carter
8569326 well you know what i wish sometimes that you john would just go poof
8569327 its emitting a strange energy signature similar to what it was doing before only about five times stronger
8569328 its late rodney why dont you get some sleep and try to finish this in the morning i dont think its going anywhere even if it does grant wishes
8569329 right ill go in a second i just want to finish writing a note to my sister
8569330 i know you didnt ask but they said theres always room for another one of us and at the moment i just really need something to take my mind off things
8569331 kaleb and i are well things got really bad it was horrible for maddie especially so we decided to just end it while we still could
8569332 i have to go ill tell you when i get there
8569333 i know the sgc already informed me shes planning on staying for a couple weeks which surprised me a little
8569334 she said she needed to get away im still kind of shocked you know
8569335 yeah wow thats really thats too bad dont they have a daughter
8569336 i should go make sure there are quarters set up for her or something
8569337 now that youre here the collective iq of atlantis has gone up you make everyone smarter by your presence
8569338 now call it coincidence but think about what john just said everyone in the city is a little smarter
8569339 the wish ronon made that everyone here was a little smarter
8569340 i thought you said that thing didnt actually grant wishes besides ronon wished that weeks ago
8569341 i know hence the reason i said it was probably a coincidence but it was just kinda funny in an odd sort of way
8569342 wait mere are you talking about that thing you emailed me about
8569343 yeah its sitting on a shelf in my lab right now because i wasnt making any progress with it but this was just strange
8569344 well maybe with any luck the next wish will come true also assuming you remember what it is
8569345 uhm yeah but i didnt exactly broadcast it to the entire city tell them yourself when you get up there
8569346 i ran into her when she was on her way back down and dragged her off to get some food
8569347 right well if you dont mind we really do have to finish that program up after dinner
8569348 well i am glad that you have decided to take that final step
8569349 well as soon as i can work up the nerve its not an easy thing
8569350 of course but i am sure he will be happy
8569351 in the perfect world mere would be happy but its him seriously sam how do you honestly think hes going to react
8569352 you dont even know how much i need this right now someone who loves me and understands that we need to do the things we do the science and saving the universe how important that is
8569353 you screwed it up the one chance you had to make me the happiest man alive and you completely fucked it up
8569354 so youd better pray to god that the third wish comes true and you vanish before i get a chance to murder you
8569355 what are you talking about what did i screw up
8569356 when you made your wish you said mckay not rodney mckay
8569357 she went and got with the wrong mckay i just saw sam kissing my little sister
8569358 do you even know what thats like seeing the woman of your dreams being a total trollop with your little sister of all people and its all your fault
8569359 this is not funny and im still waiting for you to vanish by the way
8569360 its just wrong you know and besides that way to have my dreams crushed jeannie was always the spoiled one and now shes got something ive wanted for longer than shes even known about the stargate program
8569361 youve known colonel carter for years now and shes never expressed an interest in being more than your friend maybe this is a sign that you should start focusing on someone who does actually love you
8569362 and i know that i had a beer with jennifer but i dont know that doesnt necessarily mean much
8569363 no i didnt mean that hypothetically you are loved rodney more than i think you realize
8569364 yeah yeah loved in the way that a friend loves another friend i know the deal the ideas sweet john but its not exactly what i meant
8569365 frankly i dont know what the hells been the matter with me lately and honestly rodney im sorry about making that stupid wish ok and even if it had come true the way we thought it would id have been sorry because i wouldnt have been happy for you id have been pissed
8569366 god damn it sheppard why didnt you say something sooner
8569367 sooner rodney i only just though if its so horrible maybe i shouldnt have said anything at all
8569368 this is wonderful john this is amazing you know i always was attracted to you but now we have to hurry up and do something before you vanish because stupid me just had to make that dumb wish now and
8569369 think about this mr logic have any of the wishes come true exactly the way we thought they would
8569370 no and thats the reason this mess started but what else could my wish
8569371 poof john its a slang term for a gay man
8569372 i heard those two australian guys down in botany teasing each other with it isnt that great hah i wished for you to go poof and you did it must have been something to do with the subconscious idea that the only reason ive been going after sam so much is to overcompensate for the fact that i do occasionally feel attracted to other guys
8569373 eh at least we know the ancients had a sense of humor
8569374 so youre saying that all this stuff happened because of the device you brought back two months ago
8569375 yeah its too much of a coincidence not to be
8569376 it still doesnt make any sense i mean your explanation does but how could that device make all this happen
8569377 like rodney said the pieces fit together too well for it to be a coincidence
8569378 im not saying its a coincidence im saying its a self fulfilling prophecy think about it
8569379 you sent a message to your sister about the device and in it you mentioned something about her coming out here for a while because of that message she got in a fight with kaleb about her coming out here so often and not being home to take care of madison thats what started the problems with those two which brought jeannie out here and as for the crystals lighting up they could have very well been an automated response to the word wish or even some other physical change in whoever was holding it
8569380 so that explains the first wish but what about the second one that resulted in you two
8569381 i was upset and feeling rather unwanted because of the divorce sam came to talk to me and make sure i had everything i needed and we just sort of clicked we do have a lot of things in common if you havent noticed
8569382 oh well thats purely your fault for being so damn attractive
8569383 and actually this goes for everyone just to be safe i want that device locked up and no one to make anymore wishes with it i know i said it was a self fulfilling prophecy but we dont need any of those either
8569384 the crystals are all dark again it must have some sort of automatic reset
8569385 you know its a shame colonel carter forbade us from making any more wishes on it i was going to say something along the lines of hoping everyone lives happily ever after
8569386 yeah but with our luck that would involve you mysteriously getting pregnant
8569387 me too but lets leave the actual incubating part up to the women folk ok
8569388 but i will admit it looks like you were right about that one babe

8569442 eventually mugabe agreed that they should meet again where morgan could present him with the evidence it was meant to happen the following thursday but it never happened mugabe became unavailable now the old suspicion and antagonism have come back

8569466 we knew about it for only a few weeks and had only one week to actually assemble this

8569470 you watch the first part of that game before the eighth inning and you thought we were flat
8569471 guys were swinging guys hitting balls i mean they had the kind of day we had against atlanta
8569472 the first inning how many brewers balls were hit hard one of those days balls found holes wellemeyer pitched a lot better than his numbers
8569473 we had good at bats sometimes we hit the ball hard sometimes we didnt i dont see any flatness there at all that last inning was flat i would think flat would be a compliment
8569474 thats actually insulting i hate that when i see it differently
8569475 it insults the club the third baseman was flat shortstop was flat second baseman first baseman the catcher i mean was he flat left center right no we werent flat we just got outplayed
8569476 i said before theyre in better shape than we are i also said this series in august wont determine it we need wins we need the wins more than they do and they got the first one

8569490 but it was here where toyotas engineers really shone the men in white coats came up with six packaging tricks the first is a newly developed compact differential for this front wheel drive car which by itself adds more than 4 inches to the length of the interior cabin in comparison to the toyota yaris in addition radically angled rear suspension dampers and a flat fuel tank fit under the rear seats to further improve interior space the steering column comes out of the center of the car and the dash is asymmetrical while the seatbacks are especially slim even the air conditioning unit packaged within the dash is 20 percent smaller
8569491 though the iq is just 9 8 feet long and 5 5 feet wide the cabin of this preproduction car feels remarkably spacious even for our australian size frame the generous distance from your eye across the top of the dash to the steeply angled windshield adds to the feeling of interior spaciousness so the iq feels at least one class bigger and one class more luxurious than it actually is interior quality and trim level are high especially the center console which has been artfully modeled in the shape of a manta ray the seats are comfortable and available with either cloth upholstery or partial leather the asymmetrical dashboard helps move the front passenger forward enough to accommodate an adult in the rear seat of course the space behind the driver is so small that it is relegated to shopping bags or a small child
8569492 pretty much the same power and torque as now while achieving better mileage and cleaner emissions
8569493 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8569494 my friend kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8569495 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8569496 we condemn the action of our fellow g8 member russias recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8569497 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8569498 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8569499 we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one

8569521 we plan to set out chairs and well have water and cookies i dont want the kids to be uncomfortable
8569522 i reiterate the value of a school day and that i see no reason to keep them home
8569523 we are aware there are many ways to look at this situation we choose to see this as an opportunity to open discussion
8569524 you can see the dangers it would take these kids an hour to walk to school
8569525 i cant guarantee well walk out the door with an answer but we will have a dialogue that leads to a resolution
8569526 taxpayers have told us four times no increase in taxes
8569527 imagine walking all the way to school that long distance every day these children would be exhausted and not equipped to learn

8569566 ive been using second life for a number of years now to run experiments through our studio wikitecture group to see if a metaverse such as sl might one day act as the platform for collective intelligence in architecture and urban planning im also an active member of the rl architects in sl group as you can imagine most of the members that compose these two groups are architects what i have found participating in these groups over the last year or so is that new members are always excited about using second life as either a collaborative tool or as a platform to exhibit their work unfortunately however their interest soon wanes when they find out theres no easy way to import in models from third party programs i realize theres a number of grass roots initiatives out there that have developed rough and crude ways to import from the following blender sketchup max maya although i give my utmost respect to the programmers that have developed these projects to say they are crude is to pay them a compliment what invariably happens is that after sharing these links with the many people that ask they come back if they come back at all even more confused and frustrated having labored through the elaborate and evolved process of copying and pasting pieces of code back and forth between one program and the other the process is about as easy as painting with rice grains having had a number of conversations over the year with people about this i can say with confidence that sls lack of portability is the number one hurdle for our demographic and the main reason why many people never come back although speculation i would imagine this is a major hurdle for other groups as well what i dont really understand is why this issue is not pushed more by the sl community at large i have noticed there were a number of issues posted on sls issue tracker that call for portability of a number of various file types such as obj 3dm 3ds dxf amp dae what i dont really understand is why firstly the overall sl community is not voting on this en masse and secondly why have some of these grass roots initiatives outlined above just withered on the vine some of these projects are over two years old with no sign of life or continued evolution since they were first posted having been in the middle of this conversation for awhile it seems the standard responses usually involve two factors technology and or sls economy technology from the aspect that its currently still too difficult to do and economically from the aspect that the sudden influx of new models would dilute the value of existing in world creations resulting in a negative impact on sls economy although im sure there are more reasons these seem to be at the forefront of the discussion what confuses me from my perspective anyways is that these reasons still dont seem plausible to me and im found wondering if im missing a valuable part of the equation first although i have a limited background in programming it appears from the existence of these grass roots projects that portability is indeed obtainable having dabbled a little with each project above i realize the process is laborious cutting and pasting code from one program to the other i also realize that most of these conversion programs drastically simplify the form when imported into sl such as textures being stripped off and meshes and certain objects such as cylinders and spheres being simplified down to plain box prims in sl although these are indeed hurdles the technology is currently there to do this on a very limited basis what i dont understand is why these projects havent evolved into a more user friendly format after the years they have been in place this is just a lack of user interface design verses a lack of back end programming even though they are crude and might only import texture striped sl boxes in some cases i know that i as well has a horde of others would still jump at the chance to have access to a tool like this and in most cases would actually pay good money for such a thing

8569591 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8569592 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8569593 we are in a commanding position and we dont want to throw it away were after a happy medium
8569594 kimis failure involved a part in the engine that had failed on my engine in budapest and while the team felt it was the better risk to leave kimis engine after the hungarian gp rather than give him a big grid penalty on a tight track mine of course had to be changed
8569595 now the batch of cursed con rods is no longer being used and we have instigated very close controls on the parts we are using i hope the problem has gone away for both of us
8569596 my win in valencia moves me ahead of kimi into second place in the championship
8569597 ive been asked by some media if i feel ferrari should favour me for the title now there are just six races remaining all i can say to this is that i want to keep winning to keep beating not just my team mate but the others too
8569598 decisions like this are nothing to do with me i just do the best job possible for the team and leave the rest to the team management
8569599 we spoke about it at the beginning of the year before then however lets see how things evolve
8569600 if there is an enquiry or a bid we will look at it it does not matter that it is henrik larsson
8569601 whether the club wants to sell me is up to them
8569602 coming to sale doesnt mean that i dont want to play for wales
8569603 im passionate about playing for wales and if i play well enough then everything will follow in terms of international recognition
8569604 my coming here is no barrier to representing wales and getting back into the side is definitely a goal of mine
8569605 i know mike is on his way back after his knee operation but ive got to focus on myself
8569606 my main aim has to be playing well for sale first and foremost and then hopefully wales will follow
8569607 beating donegal in the ulster semi final last year was up there but as an all round team performance it dublin win was as good
8569608 that performance was coming we needed it to get the season back on track
8569609 we were stumbling along this season but we all clicked together
8569610 does this mean that andrei remains at zenit this is a question that is better directed at coach dick advocaat
8569611 war artist didnt pull out right this morning and im not happy with him
8569612 i would say he is a doubtful runner at haydock but i will make a final decision on monday when i would need to confirm the horse it seems sensible to wait until then
8569613 i dont think it is anything serious his action just doesnt seem quite right and it could just be he has had enough for this year as he has been on the go since march
8569614 we will have to speak with the owners but it could be that we put the overseas trip on hold for next year
8569615 i want to clear up one thing i am the true heavyweight champion
8569616 vitali you never beat a champion you say you are the champion but you are not a champion you cant be the champion until you beat me and you cant
8569617 i have fought 31 fights and never ducked anyone i am making one promise today wednesday i will knock vitali out
8569618 trust me i will knock out vitali and then i will beat his brother wladimir the current wbo and ibf titleholder there is no doubt about that
8569619 i am pleased to say that i am back i am happy to be back in the ring happy to fight for my title i gave away my title freely because of my knee injury
8569620 i feel sorry for peter that i must fight him sceptical people say that i wont win because i have been out of the ring for three years but i did not lose the title i am honored to fight for jos sulaim n wbc president who gave me this chance
8569621 i have big respect for mr lou duva peters promoter but his fighters always say they will knock me out and it never happens mr duva is preparing peter to knock me out but this will never happen
8569622 i dont underestimate peter he is a good puncher i will give my best to be the winner to take my title back and to make history where two brothers will be champions at the same time its a huge motivation for me
8569623 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8569624 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8569625 nobody could have foreseen this situation a year ago let along four weeks ago when i signed a new contract
8569626 we have accepted the pay cuts for the good of the club and we have to do the best we can but something needs to happen quickly for the sake of the football club
8569627 hopefully as the examiner said today there are number of investors looking around but that will not happen for a few weeks
8569628 it could be damage limitation by then because lads might have left or gone back to work at the moment we are fine but in a few weeks lad might not be able to afford to turn up for training
8569629 the more the fans that come to the game the more money comes into the club and that means that we can clear the debts quicker
8569630 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8569631 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8569632 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8569633 la 28 august cifrele noastre dezv luiau un num r de 1 692 de mor i i 1 500 de r ni i n urma agresiunii georgiene
8569634 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8569635 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8569636 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8569637 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8569638 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8569639 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8569640 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8569641 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8569642 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8569643 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

8569646 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8569647 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8569654 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8569655 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8569656 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8569657 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8569658 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8569659 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8569660 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8569661 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8569662 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8569663 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8569664 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8569665 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8569666 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8569667 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8569668 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8569670 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8569671 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

8569683 emancipate yourselves from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our minds
8569684 we do not have the same presence we used to have in the processing facilities when the cat is away the mice will play
8569685 we are not making the observations we used to make when we had more of a hands on approach we spend more time looking at paper than anything else
8569686 weve had all our authority taken away and now we are just paper pushers
8569687 inspectors verify cooking temperatures and observe and validate a companys sanitary practices the cfia also directly supervises the sample collection process in the plant
8569688 and while some might characterize that as paperwork i characterize that as an important element of an effective inspection system

8569700 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8569701 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8569702 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8569703 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8569704 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8569705 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8569706 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8569707 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8569708 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8569709 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8569710 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8569711 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8569712 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8569713 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8569714 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8569715 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8569716 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8569717 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8569718 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8569719 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8569720 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8569721 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8569722 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8569724 nevertheless we believe these contracting changes along with other modifications help to clear up those possible misperceptions
8569725 the mood here at this convention on the pro choice issue strikes me as different than the mood in the past id like to ask you about that
8569726 i think if we continue to have a platform in stark contrast to the republican platform i believe we are going to start losing
8569727 i do think the mood is different i think barack obama reflects that kind of perspective and that helps the mood

8569731 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8569732 a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8569733 but i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country
8569734 john thinks that during the bush years weve made great economic progress i think its been abysmal
8569735 and in the senate john has voted with president bush 95 and that is very hard to believe
8569736 thats the america george bush has left us and thats the america well continue to get if george sorry john mccain is elected president of the united states in november
8569737 john mccain doesnt seem to get it barack obama gets it though
8569738 and i realised he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8569739 less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8569740 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8569741 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up

8569747 it blew the porch to pieces and damaged several windows i cannot speculate on a motive for this but we are clearly dealing with people who have no regard for human life
8569748 i heard about the proposed plans when i was holding my summer surgery in shorwell and limerstone on tuesday august 19th i was approached by several local residents who were extremely concerned about what a wind farm could mean for the area on thursday 21st i raised the issue with the leader of the islands council cllr pugh and the chief executive steve beynon and they negotiated a two week extension of the scoping report this period i hope will give shorwell residents and others time to ask the questions they need

8569761 but with the introduction of an exclusive right of way for pedestrians everyone can feel more confident of making it through the intersection safely
8569762 were really trying hard to make the city of toronto a more walkable much more comfortable city to walk in and search as well as without having to deal with traffic turning right or left

8569849 the right man for the right job at the right time
8569850 theres always highs and lows coming to whitehaven was a big high the place was in a bit of turmoil when i arrived but the directors did a fantastic job bringing everything back from the brink of disaster
8569851 what happened at workington was a very stressful part of my life
8569852 yes it would have been id never been out of work before it was very hard mentally and financially your self esteem does drop
8569853 at workington a lot of people dont know the real truth of the matter i hope people dont think it was anything to do with the way i coached town i had a good record
8569854 with the little man on your shoulder and a lot of hard work you can come through as i did in the end at whitehaven we are a team of battlers ive been a battler all my life
8569855 you have to feel good about yourself and get satisfaction from your job this group of players express themselves a hell of a lot more than i think they have done in the past all these things make you sleep better at night thats for sure
8569856 there is another side to me i can be tough when decisions have to be made i think being nice and having respect for people is important
8569857 ive been known to be a little bit aggressive at times but with good reason i dont think there is a mean streak in me i take decisions that have to be made the same as anybody in a leadership role
8569858 i think if you talk to the players you will find that half time is fairly analytical looking at areas we may need to improve and exploit but there have been occasions when you need to be straight down the line and be honest about peoples performance
8569859 you can only really go off now and again i am not a great believer in chucking things and raising my voice too much
8569860 sometimes it needs to happen but i generally find if you can analyse the first half and make it brief and understandable you generally get a positive reaction from the players
8569861 they have to enjoy their environment and all our coaching team are part of making that comfortable
8569862 paul charlton we had some memorable and torrid training sessions with paul a legend and absolute fitness freak
8569863 when paul left ike southward came in another legend but it was chalk and cheese ike had a different way of coaching i only wish he was still around i was very proud to be a pall bearer at his funeral
8569864 ike was one of the most charismatic coaches i have ever been under he probably had a different style to any other coach thats ever been and he was successful
8569865 the first three weeks i had no idea what he was talking about when we were working on the derwent park groundstaff together that was the same for a lot of cumbrians i didnt know what was going on half the time in conversations
8569866 coming into coaching myself was a bit of a rude awakening
8569867 video analysis was very rare even when i was playing international rugby league in new zealand now its a very big part of the game something i relish
8569868 id love to play today totally different conditions the players have to be a lot fitter now everythings done for them theres no excuse now nowhere to hide
8569869 whatever that means but there is a modicum of sociability in rugby league i dont think we should ever lose that we have some fairly strict procedures to follow
8569870 the social side is something we probably lack a little bit at the moment its just finish the game and have a bite to eat and get on the bus
8569871 maybe 20 years ago when there wasnt such an emphasis on recovery and rehab you spent a little more time having a crack over a few beers but things change for the best in some ways
8569872 our players at whitehaven are very professional in what they do before and after the game they are not saints but can enjoy a night out at the appropriate time
8569873 if they do break the rules then they get found out we have to be a team playing 100 per cent all the time or else we are going to struggle i dont go round knocking on players doors before a game and ringing them up thats for sure
8569874 there is a responsibility to the team to the town and to the supporters that the players act in the right ways especially now when we are bringing through a whole group of young players
8569875 role model is a word i seldom use but we have to make sure we are doing the right things
8569876 yeah but it was a different time a different culture by the same token those guys worked very hard off the field part time professionals and also at training
8569877 at the appropriate time but i used to try and make sure i looked after myself sometimes you liked nothing more than to get on the bus and get home but if the directors werent ready to leave you stayed
8569878 no absolutely not never in my life that was something brought up by some people who obviously had an agenda i very rarely drink now at all
8569879 you have to be right on top of your game as a head coach and make sure that your lifestyle is beyond reproach
8569880 you will always get things said about you i hate it when people tell lies the tall poppy syndrome we call it in new zealand as soon as you put your head above the parapet somebody wants to cut it off
8569881 well im pleased about that people are allowed their opinions and as long as they are put in a proper manner thats fine by me but theres always the odd person or two who wants to put it in a detrimental or derogatory way
8569882 they dont bother me too much now its water off a ducks back
8569883 i think you have to but ive still got feelings things have been said about me and my family in the past that make the hairs stand up on the back of your head but you have to learn to control your emotions there are breaking points for anybody
8569884 shes been absolutely fantastic supporting me all the way i dont think i could have done it without my family and friends when we were going through that bad patch
8569885 we got a lot of solace at the time following our son ben who is an excellent cricketer and made it into the england under 16 team
8569886 i played both union and league but everybody in the family had played league at some stage so it was a no brainer
8569887 back in christchurch i had a tough upbringing my father was a plasterer but he did two jobs so the family could send me to a good college one of the big four in new zealand
8569888 a lot of the all blacks came from those colleges i was selected for representative rugby at union but my goal was to make the schoolboy kiwis i made it with the likes of kurt sorenson
8569889 i was a rebel at college and ended up being asked to leave really a pain in the butt 15 year old
8569890 very much so they gave you the cane on a regular basis and i was a regular attender laughing you just learned to take the pain i left school and thought i was going to be able to loll around doing nothing but two days later my father had me on the building site as an apprentice plasterer a very big wake up call
8569891 mal meninga wally lewis and co were all playing that australian team was fantastic
8569892 i never played in a test match i believe i should have done ces mountford was the coach and got very influenced by certain players such as kevin tamati a good prop
8569893 one tour game i walked away with the man of the match but when we had the team meeting next day i had a ridiculously low tackle count and guess who was doing the tackle count kevin
8569894 there were some very good players in the front row such as mark broadhurst mark graham was test captain halfbacks were clayton friend carlisle whitehaven and shane varley who went to workington and recommended me
8569895 the money really town were in the first division then
8569896 my first outing was against warrington at derwent park and i got the player of the match but i got a really bad injury which stopped me playing for cumbria against new zealand and didnt play as many games id hoped to
8569897 well you need a bit of fire in your blood to play your best rugby its an aggressive game but controlled aggression ive had my fair share of judiciary duties
8569898 always for me thats the future strength of whitehaven theres some very good youth talent here who have come through the systems i think you will see that talent flower over the next two or three years
8569899 i would love to coach in super league be involved with any team from cumbria that goes into super league i think cumbria in any shape or form should be the next team in
8569900 i honestly do feel that the rfl would rush in with both hands and say yes please do it
8569901 i have achieved my international coaching qualifications and was very close to coaching the national team when i was assistant to gary freeman
8569902 daniel anderson st helens came into the frame i was disappointed not to succeed gary i think i could have done a very good job
8569903 actually it was we were playing against each other in christchurch the week before i came to play for workington town it wasnt anything other than my finger getting caught in his sock at the play the ball
8569904 i dislocated it went over to the sideline and asked them to put it back in they said no we are not allowed to you have to go to hospital its too bad a dislocation so i put the finger back in myself taped it up and went back on but i had broken it
8569905 i reckon it was kevins fault for kicking back at the play the ball i used to get it injected all the time but in the end it was that bad i had to get it taken off
8569906 i have always been a day to day person not a planner sometimes i dont know where my next pennys coming from

8569960 this isnt 1992 and obama shouldnt repeat everything clinton did but clintons emphasis on rewarding work worked for him
8569961 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8569962 barack obama knows that america cannot strong abroad unless we are first strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8569963 america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
